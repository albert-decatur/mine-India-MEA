    <td>
      DURING the year under review, momentous political, social and economic 
developments in different parts of the world brought about a radical 
transformation in international relations. The dramatic political changes in 
Eastern Europe and the march of Soviet Union towards market economy and 
political pluralism presaged a complete turnaround in international political 

alignments and rivalries. The Cold War came to an end and a new era of 
entente between major economic and political powers was ushered in.<br><br> 
 
     The Gulf War was a massive aberration from the general trend of detente 
and cooperation in international affairs. Immediately after the occupation of 

Kuwait by Iraq, India issued a statement reiterating her firm position against 
the 
use of force in, relations between States and annexation of territory and calle
d 
upon Iraq to withdraw her troops from Kuwait. India took a series of initiative
s 
designed to seek a non-military solution to the Gulf crisis. Before the outbrea
k 
of the war, India did all it could to prevent it. The two meetings of Non-align
ed 
countries on this subject convened in Belgrade in September 1990 and January 
1991, were both on India's initiative.<br><br> 
 
     India adhered to all the 12 mandatory UN Security Council resolutions on 

sanctions against Iraq and took effective steps to implement them. India also 

maintained Ministerial and diplomatic contacts with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and 
other States in the region before, during and after the war in an attempt to 
safeguard our interests in the Gulf We adopted a principled position during the
 
Gulf crisis, and have been playing a constructive role in the Security Council 

which has been constantly seized with this matter.<br><br> 
 
     India was able successfully to undertake the gigantic task of evacuating i
ts 
citizens from Iraq and Kuwait. After the first few days of disorder which led t
o 
some suffering among our nationals as among those of all other countries, we 
carried out one of the most successful operations of organized evacuation ever 

undertaken in recent history. India completed, by the end of October 1990, the 

evacuation of over 150,000 Indians from Kuwait and Iraq, the bulk of them by ai
r 
from Amman. This was appreciated and regarded as a model by leaders and 
senior officials of the local Governments and the international agencies associ
ated 
with, the operation.<br><br> 
 
     India continued to pursue the goals of peace, friendship and cooperation i
n 
her relations with neighbours in South Asia. Improvement of India-Nepal 
relations received high priority, particularly in. the context of the severe st
rains 
                                         (i) 
 
that had surfaced after the lapse of the Indo-Nepal Treaties of Trade and Trans
it 
in March 1989. The installation of a democratic Government in Nepal in April 
1990 helped in the process. The signing of the joint Communique at the end of 

the visit of Prime Minister Bhattarai to Delhi and its prompt implementation 
resulted in the complete normalisation of relations between the two countries. 

This process was consolidated and additional measures for strengthening these 

relations were considered during the visit of the then External Affairs Ministe
r, 
Shri I K Gujral to Kathmandu in August 1990. The visit of the former Prime 
Minister, Shri Chandra Shekhar to Nepal in February 1991--the first such visit 
in 
fourteen years--provided further momentum to the intensification of bilateral 

cooperation for mutual benefit. <br><br>
 
     India continued to nurture the traditionally close and friendly relations 
with 
Bhutan. The Bhutanese King visited India in November 1990, his third visit to 

India that year. India continued its contribution to ongoing and new develop- 

ment projects in Bhutan and promoting cooperation in other areas. 
 
     Positive momentum was maintained in India's relations with Bang- 
ladesh. The then Bangladesh Foreign Minister visited New Delhi in May 1990 
when the joint Economic Commission met after a gap of seven years. India has 
extended a Government-to-Government credit of Rs 30 crores to Bangladesh. A 
ruling by the Supreme Court of India on the leasing of the Tin Bigha territory 
to 
Bangladesh has paved the way for the full implementation of the Indo-Bangladesh
 
Land Boundary Agreement. Our trade and economic cooperation with Banglad- 
esh has also registered impressive gains in the past year. India welcomed the 

establishment of a democratically elected Government in Bangladesh. Foreign 
Secretary visited Dhaka as Prime Minister's Special Envoy in March 1991 and 
conveyed to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh India's keen desire to work closel
y 
with her Government for further improving our relations.<br><br> 
 
     India continued her endeavour to reduce tensions in her relations with 
Pakistan. A Confidence Building Package was proposed by India on 
May 28, 1990, which inter-alia, called upon Pakistan to stop its support to ter
rorism, seize 
arms and terrorists, deny transit facilities to terrorists, and hand Over fugit
ives 
from law. Pursuant to the proposal made by India, three rounds of Foreign 
Secretary level talks took place. Agreements were reached on several Confi- 
dence Building Measures. Weekly telephonic contact was introduced between 
Directors General of Military Operations of the two countries. A hot-line was 

established between the Prime Ministers of the two countries. Instruments of 
Ratification of the Agreement on Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installa
- 
 
                                        (ii) 
 
tion and Facilities were exchanged. Discussions were resumed on pending 
issues such as the boundary in the Sir Creek area. However, Pakistan's support 

to terrorism and subversion in the States of Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir 
continued unabated and stands in the way of the normalisation of our 
relationship. We are continuing our endeavour to persuade Pakistan to abandon 

her negative approach towards India and join us in establishing a good- 
neighbourly and tension-free relationship on the basis of the Simla Agreement. 

 
     Soon after the de-induction of the Indian Peace Keeping Force from Sri Lan
ka 
in March 1990, hostilities broke out again between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan 

forces, which have got caught up in an escalating spiral of violence. Govern- 

ment of India has remained concerned about this, and in particular the loss of 

innocent lives and the hardships and suffering caused to civilians. The continu
- 
ing hostilities have also led to a fresh influx of refugees into Tamil Nadu 
numbering about 120,000. Government of India's objectives in Sri Lanka have 
been: to strive for the safety and security of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, which w
ould 
also permit a return of the refugees in India; to foster the process of politic
al 
solution through dialogue on the basis of Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement; and to 
restore Indo-Sri Lankan relations to traditional levels of cordiality and frien
d- 
ship. It is against this background that the then External Affairs Minister, Sh
ri V 
C Shukla visited Colombo from 28 to 31 January 1991. The visit enabled us to 
stress our concerns regarding the ethnic issue and our desire to expand bilater
al 
relations in their widest sense. <br><br>
 
     The close and friendly relations between India and Maldives were further 

reinforced by high-level visits. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom visited Delhi 

in March 1990 and again as Chief Guest for the Republic Day. The former Prime 

Minister, Shri V P Singh visited Male from 22 to 24 June 1990 and later the 
former Prime Minister, Shri Chandra Shekhar from 21 to 23 November 1990 for 
the SAARC Summit. Indo-Maldivian cooperation now encompasses health and 
welfare, infrastructure projects, defence, manpower resources development, civi
l 
aviation, communication and trade.<br><br> 
 
     The first genuine elections held in Myanmar after almost twenty-eight year
s 
resulted in an overwhelming verdict in favour of democratic forces. Despite thi
s 
clear verdict, power has not been transferred to the elected representatives of
 
her people. We hope this will be done soon so that normalcy can return in the 

country, facilitating the revival and strengthening of our bilateral relations 
with 
Myanmar and enabling her to play her rightful role in the comity of nations. 
 
                                  (iii) 
 
     India continued to work for a strong, stable, independent and non-aligned 

Afghanistan and to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship and cooperatio
n 
with that country. The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan came to New Delhi in 
June 1990 for the meeting of the Indo-Afghan joint Commission. Thereafter, 
President Najibullah visited India on a State Visit in August 1990. New areas o
f 
cooperation have been identified, bilateral relations have been further intensi
fied 
and agreements signed on cooperation in agriculture, narcotics control and 
cultural exchanges. We have agreed upon a major expansion of our technical 
and economic cooperation with Afghanistan. 
 
     India continued to take initiatives within SAARC for deepening and expand-
 
ing regional cooperation among South Asian countries. India actively pursued 
adoption of measures for increasing people-to-people contacts; and increasing 

cooperation in trade, industry, money and finance. Studies exploring pos- 
sibilities of such cooperation have been undertaken in some of these areas. The
 
former Prime Minister, Shri Chandra Shekhar, visited Maldives to participate in
 
the 6th SAARC Summit in November 1990. At India's suggestion regional 
cooperation under SAARC was extended to the field of biotechnology and the 
proposal to create a Fund for the identification and development of regional 
projects to be financed by national banks of the member-countries was also 
accepted. Cooperation among the SAARC countries is essential for accelerating 

our economic development, for building individual and collective self-reliance 

and for enhancing our bargaining strength in multilateral negotiations. India 

remains committed to assuming responsibility for making SAARC an effective and 

full-fledged venture of regional cooperation, consistent with her size, resourc
es 
and stage of development.<br><br> 
 
     India's relations with China have steadily improved since the visit of the
 then 
Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi to that country in December 1988. The 
momentum of bilateral exchanges has increased. The high-level political dialo- 

gue has intensified. Successive Governments have stressed the factors of 
continuity and consensus in India's policy towards China. Better understanding 

and cooperation between India and China, the two largest countries of Asia, is 

not only in the mutual interest of the two countries but also can assist in the
 
maintenance of peace and stability in our region and the world. The dialogue 
with China on the outstanding boundary question has continued with both sides 

having enhanced their understanding of each other's approach to a settlement of
 
this question. The discussions during the second Meeting of the Joint Working 

Group on the boundary question, which met in New Delhi in August 1990 were 
held in an atmosphere of frankness and cordiality. We have stressed the 
 
                                     (iv) 
 
adoption of a forward-looking approach so that a mutually acceptable solution 

that is in conformity with national interests and sentiments is arrived at. 
 
     The Soviet Union has been undergoing fundamental changes over the past 
few years. India's priority has been to maintain the stability of our vital 
relationship with the Soviet Union in the light of new challenges imposed by 
perestroika and changing Indian and Soviet priorities. The warmth and cordialit
y 
of Indo-Soviet relations were reaffirmed by the visit of the former Prime Minis
ter, 
Shri V P Singh to Moscow in July 1990. The visit confirmed that India and the 

Soviet Union have a multi-dimensional, stable and time-tested relationship that
 
enjoys the broad support of the peoples of both countries and should, therefore
, 
be preserved and strengthened further.<br><br> 
 
     The ongoing interaction between India and United States of America has 
generated a greater degree of understanding and sensitivity to each other's 
concerns and interests. India's effort has been to enlarge the existing areas o
f 
cooperation with USA, encompassing the commercial, scientific, technical and 
cultural fields. India believes that building a mutually beneficial and mature 

relationship is a goal shared by both India and USA. A series of high-level vis
its 
and exchange of views have brought about a better appreciation of India's 
standpoint on a wide range of issues, including on the situation in the Punjab 
and 
Jammu &amp; Kashmir in the context of Pakistan's role in aggravating the situation.<br><br>
 
 
     There have been deep-rooted and profound changes in the European 
continent since traditional confrontation between the East and West blocs has 

given way to cooperation. The two Germanys are united and the free 
movement of peoples and in due course, of capital and labour, are shortly in th
e 
offing. The base for a Common European Home has already been laid and the 
integration of the Common Market in 1992 will further contribute to transform- 

ing Europe into an important political and economic power. India has had close 

links with both halves of Europe through a wide network of economic and 
commercial contacts. We have welcomed these far-reaching changes, which no 
doubt will serve the cause of peace and stability and contribute to the 
development of the world economy. 
 
     During the year under review, considerable progress has been made in 
bilateral relations with Western Europe through the exchange of several high- 

level visits. Notable among them have been those of our President, Shri R 
Venkataraman to UK, Portugal and Malta in March and April 1990 and of the 
President of Federal Republic of Germany to India. The then External Affairs 
 
                                           (v) 
 
Minister, Shri I K Gujral also visited several European countries for discussio
ns 
with his counterparts. Particularly important was our political dialogue with t
he 
European Community's 'Troika' Foreign Ministers. The Community's progress 
towards an integrated European market by 1992 offers challenges and oppor- 
tunities for India. Several measures, including those designed to foster instit
u- 
tional linkages with EC, were either taken or under consideration, to take 
advantage of the Single European Market for promoting our exports and 
economic cooperation with the European Community. <br><br>
 
     Momentous changes in the direction of democracy and political pluralism 
have swept the nations of the Eastern Europe. We have welcomed this 
movement towards democracy and more humane and liberal system of governan- 
ce. India has traditionally enjoyed very close and mutually beneficial politica
l 
and economic relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. As with the rest 

of the world, we are on the threshold of a significant new phase in our politic
al 
and economic relations with these countries. We are confident that as these 
countries follow a more open economic system and integrate with the main- 
stream of the world economy, new opportunities will open up for strengthening 

and widening India's existing cooperation with them. The Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia and the President of Romania 
visited India. The then External Affairs Minister, Shri I K Gujral, visited 
Yugoslavia in March 1990 for bilateral discussions and again in September 1990 

in the context of consultations on the Gulf crisis. 
 
     We attach very high importance to our relations with Japan, a country with
 
which we have traditionally enjoyed friendly relations. in recent years, our 
interaction with Japan in the economic and technological fields has been 
strengthened and diversified. Japan has become a major economic partner and 
we deeply appreciate the positive, and constructive attitude she has shown in 

responding to our requirements. 
 <br><br>
     The importance attached by India to the maintenance and expansion of close
 
and friendly relations with all the countries of South East Asia is testified b
y the 
high-level contacts and frequency of interactions with these countries. The ver
y 
first bilateral visit by the former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh was to 
Malaysia. High-level exchange of visits also took place with several other ASEA
N 
countries. The India-Vietnam joint Commission met under the co-chairmanship 
of the two Foreign Ministers in April 1990 during which an agreement was 
signed for the utilisation of the latest Government of India credit for railway
s and 
telecommunications. The Ho Chi Minh Centenary celebrations in India, coordi- 
 
                                         (vi) 
 
     nated under the auspices of a National Committee chaired by the Prime Mini
ster, 
concluded in January 1991 in Calcutta, where a big public function was 
organized with high-level Vietnamese participation. India continued her active 

and constructive role, through close contact both with ASEAN and the Indo- 
China states, in the process designed to find a political solution to the Cambo
dian 
conflict. 
 
     Developments in Fiji were of great concern to India. The Indian Mission in
 
Suva had to be closed in May 1990. Institutionalisation of racial discriminatio
n 
of Fiji was opposed by India and the promulgation of an undemocratic 
constitution was strongly condemned by us in August 1990. <br><br>
 
     There can be no durable or stable peace in West Asia without a comprehen- 

sive settlement of the Palestinian problem. India continued to extend full 
support to the just struggle of the Palestinian people. The then External Affai
rs 
Minister, Shri I K Gujral participated in the meeting of the NAM Committee of 

Nine on Palestine, held in Tunis in March 1990. We have conveyed both 
through bilateral contacts and in multilateral fora our commitment to supportin
g 
a settlement based on the Palestinian right to self-determination, the vacation
 of 
all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the security of all the States in 
the 
region. 
 
     Developments in sub-Saharan Africa have been rapid and overall, 
positive. The release of Dr Nelson Mandela and the subsequent steps taken by 
the South African Government for dismantling certain aspects of apartheid were 

welcomed by India. India fully supported the demand of the African National 
Congress to implement further measures leading to the irreversible elimination 
of 
apartheid in South Africa. Namibia's independence in March 1990 was of far- 
reaching importance in the context, of the struggle for a unitary, non-racist a
nd 
democratic South Africa. Former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh participated in 

the Independence Day Celebrations in Windhoek. Dr Mandela's visit to India in 

October 1990 enabled India to pay homage to a living symbol of struggle against
 
apartheid. <br><br>
 
     India was elected to the Security Council for a two-year term commencing 

1 January 1991. India was, therefore, directly involved in the deliberations an
d 
decisions of the Security Council on the Gulf conflict in 1991. India's positio
n 
on each question reflected her principled opposition to the use of force as wel
l 
as her concern that all actions of the Security Council should be in conformity
 
with the UN Charter. <br><br>
 
                                              (vii) 
 
     The UN Security Council has recently come to play an increasing role in 
resolving conflicts and dealing with situations leading to a breach of or threa
t to 
international security. This is because, for the first time since the inception
 of 
the United Nations, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are 

acting in concert. India welcomes the enhanced effectiveness of the United 
Nations. At the same time, India calls for wider application of the democratic 

principle in the decision-making procedures of the United Nations and specifi- 

cally in the Security Council. While the trend increasingly is to extend suppor
t 
in ushering in pluralism and democracy in individual States, equality and 
democratic decision-making are absent in the functioning of international 
organizations--the UN Security Council in particular. These could have most 
disturbing implications for developing countries. The political preoccupation o
f 
the industrialised countries with Eastern Europe and their disregard for develo
p- 
ment issues on the international agenda have come in the way of the revival of 

the North-South dialogue There is also an increasing tendency to interfere in 

the internal affairs of developing countries on grounds of human rights and for
 
the purpose of securing disarmament on a selective and discriminatory basis. 
 
     India considers that the deepening of the debt crisis and the erosion of 

norms, rules and regulations of the international monetary, financial and tradi
ng 
systems could have adverse repercussions on developing countries such as 
India. It was in this context that the summit level group on South-South 
cooperation, namely, the Group of 15 had been set up at India's initiative at t
he 
time of the last Non-aligned Summit Conference at Belgrade. The first Summit 
level meeting of the Group of 15 was held in Kuala Lumpur in June 1990. The 
Indian delegation was led by the former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh. The 
Summit meeting, identified some concrete and specific projects for South-South 

cooperation And issued a statement giving the perception of the leaders of the 

G-15 on major international economic issues and outlining the common strategy 

to be adopted for resolving them. 
 <br><br>
     India participated actively in a large number of multilateral meetings on 

global environmental issues. A Conference on Global Environmental Issues of 
twenty select developing countries was held in New Delhi in April 1990, with a 

view to evolving a developing country perspective on such issues. India also 
successfully promoted a series of amendments to the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer that were adopted at the London 
meeting of the States Parties in June 1990. India has been playing her due role
 
in the preparatory process leading upto the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development scheduled in 1992. 
 
                                    (viii) 
 
     The transformation of East-West relations has changed the context but not 

the relevance of the Non-Aligned Movement. Its position against the blocs 
having been vindicated, its future course of action would have to concentrate 

increasingly on the North-South divide, disarmament, environment and the 
democratisation of the multilateral system under the United Nations. India has 

continued to contribute positively to the ongoing exercise on reorienting the 

role of the Movement in the changing global environment through the develop- 
ment of a broad consensus on the rationale of non-alignment in the context of 

the current reality and the adjustments that are called for in its method of wo
rk, 
modalities of functioning and agenda.<br><br>

      INDIA'S NEIGHBOURS<br><br> 
 
     DURING the year under review, India continued to pursue the goals of 
peace, friendship and cooperation in relations with its neighbours in South 
Asia, bilaterally and through fora like SAARC, the Non-Aligned Movement and the
 
United Nations. 
 
     Relations between India and Nepal have traditionally been extremely close 

and cordial. Over the years India has been extending considerable economic and 

technical assistance to Nepal and, till recently, was one of its largest donors
. 
However, strains surfaced in. Indo-Nepal relations over the past few years, 
especially after the lapse of the Indo-Nepal Treaties of Trade and Transit in M
arch 
1989, consequent on the non-fulfilment by Nepal of the commitments made when 
a new Trade. Treaty was negotiated aid initialled in October 1998. 
 
     The Government of India accorded high priority to improving Indo-Nepal 
relations, and various initiatives were taken in this regard, which resulted in
 great 
mutual understanding of each other's interests and concerns and agreement on th
e 
need for a comprehensive solution of all outstanding problems. In April 1990, 

the success of the mass movement for multi-party democracy in Nepal led to the 

installation of an interim Government headed by Prime Minister Krishna Prasad 

Bhattarai. India warmly welcomed these developments. <br><br>
 
     Prime Minister Bhattarai's visit to India in June 1990, ended with the sig
ning 
by the two Prime Ministers of a joint Communique which restored status quo ante
 
in bilateral relations to 1 April 1987, a period before the recent bilateral te
nsions 
emerged. This was to be pending the finalisation of a comprehensive arrange- 
 
                             <br>pg1<br>
 
ment covering all aspects of bilateral relations. India went beyond the status 
quo 
ante in extending certain extra relaxations in the tariff and entry regime of 

Nepalese exports to India that had considerable potential, if properly exploite
d, to 
increase such exports. The Indian stand by credit facility for Nepal was increa
sed 
from Rs 25 crores to Rs 35 crores. Nepal undertook, inter-alia to remove Indian
 
nationals in Nepal from the ambit of the Work Permit Scheme and to assure India
n 
teachers in Nepal the same conditions of employment as Nepalese nationals. 
 
     Both sides undertook to My respect each other's security concerns, not to 

allow activities in the territory of the one prejudicial to the security of the
 other, 
and to have prior consultations, with a view to reaching mutual agreement on 
such defence related matters which, in the view of either country, could pose a
 
threat to its security. <br><br>
 
     India and Nepal also decided to usher in a new era of bilateral cooperatio
n, 
particularly in the spheres of industrial and human resource development, for 

harnessing of the waters of the common rivers for the benefit of the peoples of
 the 
two countries and for the protection and management of the environment. 
 
     On the Indian side, the commitments under the Joint Communique were 
fulfilled ahead of the deadline of Jul 01, 1990. Most of the Nepalese commit- 

ments were also fulfilled, and it is expected that action will be completed soo
n on 
the outstanding points. 
 
     The then Minister for External Affairs, Shri I K Gujral, visited Kathmandu
 in 
August 1990, and held discussions with Prime Minister Bhattarai and other 
Nepalese political leaders. Various possibilities of widening bilateral economi
c 
cooperation were considered. 
 <br><br>
     Prime Minister Bhattarai paid a transit visit to India in November 1990, a
nd 
had detailed discussions with the Prime Minister, the Minister for External Aff
airs 
and the Minister for Water Resources on issues of mutual concern. Various 
potentially far-reaching decisions on bilateral cooperation were taken, especia
lly in 
the field of water resources development, one of the four key areas identified 
in 
the Joint Communique. These included undertaking of a comprehensive joint 
survey of the full hydel potential of Nepal and the working out of a phased 
programme for its development, setting up a bilateral joint Rivers Commission, 

a comprehensive survey of the potential of the whole Kosi river basin and India
n 
 
                              <br>pg2<br> 
 
agreement in principle to purchase surplus power from the Nepalese hydel 
projects, subject to negotiation and agreement on prices. Early implementation 
of 
these decisions would substantially benefit the economies of both countries. 
 
     A bilateral agreement was signed in December 1990 for the construction by 

India, on a turnkey and grant aid basis, of a Rs 3 crore new road cum rail brid
ge at 
Raxaul, the most important border point for both bilateral and transit cargo 
movements to and from Nepal. The new bridge is expected to be ready by early 
1993. In August 1990, the then Minister for External Affairs inaugurated the Rs
 2 
crore Mohana bridge in western Nepal, also constructed on a turnkey basis as a 

part of the Indian aid programme to Nepal. <br><br>
 
     Prime Minister's visit to Nepal from 13 to 15 February 1991 was the first 
such 
visit in 14 years and his first bilateral visit abroad. It included visits to J
anakpur 
and Biratnagar in the Nepalese Terai besides Kathmandu. At all these three 
places, Prime Minister addressed civic receptions in his honour; for Janakpur a
nd 
Biratnagar this was again a first. Besides the official talks, Prime Minister a
lso met 
a wide spectrum of Nepalese political leaders. 
 
     Many significant decisions were taken and work programmes finalised for 
intensifying bilateral economic cooperation for mutual benefit. A high level ta
sk 
force will be set up to prepare such a comprehensive economic cooperation 
programme by June 1991, working under the overall guidance of the Indo-Nepal 
joint Commission. A series of key technical meetings covering the most 
important hydel projects like Kosi, Karnali and Pancheshwar will be held betwee
n 
end February and mid-April 1991. The Indo-Nepal Sub Commission on Water 
Resources will meet again in April after a gap of over two years. Both sides wi
ll 
consider taking up several potentially attractive medium sized hydel projects a
nd 
will immediately start work on additional flood protection measures. Cooperatio
n 
in health care will also be intensified--the Bir Hospital in Kathmandu will be 

expanded; and a medical college in Biratnagar considered. Intensive cooperation
 
in the fields of railways and civil aviation will be pursued. <br><br>
 
     The traditionally close and friendly relations between India and Bhutan we
re 
further strengthened during the year under review. His Majesty King Jigme 
Singye Wangchuck visited India thrice during 1990; in January, January/February
 
 
                            <br>pg3<br>
 
and November. He held discussions with the President, Shri R Venkataraman, 
the former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh, the Prime Minister, Shri Chandra 
Shekhar, and other senior Ministers of the Government of India. The discus- 
sions on bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest were marked by a 

close identity of views and great warmth and cordiality. 
 
     From the Indian side, the then Minister for Commerce and Tourism 
visited Bhutan in March 1990, and the then Minister for Energy and Civil 
Aviation in August 1990. The Finance Minister also paid a brief visit in 
January 199 1. Foreign Secretary visited Bhutan in October 1990. 
 
     The growing economic and technical cooperation between the two coun- 
tries was maintained and intensified. The highlight in this regard was the 
signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, during the King's visit to India in 

November 1990, in accordance with which India is to prepare the Detailed 
Project Reports for the Tala Hydroelectric Project (Chukha, Phase II) and the 

Wangchu Reservoir Scheme (Chukha, Phase III), for 1000 MW and. 600 MW 
respectively, and more ambitious than the very successful 336 MW Chukha 
Hydel Project. 
 <br><br>
     A new Indo-Bhutan Trade and Commerce Agreement (1990-1995) was 
signed in Thimphu on 2 March 1990 during the then Commerce Minister's 
visit. It provided for the continuation of free trade between the two coun- 
tries, and also opened it to private Bhutanese traders, besides simplifying ent
ry 
procedures and other similar facilities. 
 
     A new Air Services Agreement between the two countries was finalised 
after prolonged negotiations and will be signed soon. The new runway and 
hangar building at Paro Airport, part of the airport upgradation project being 

executed by India, were inaugurated by the then Minister for Energy and Civil 

Aviation during his visit to Bhutan in August 1990. 
 
     During the same visit, a new protocol was signed to equalize the rates at 

which India purchases firm and seasonal power from the Chukha Hydel Pro- 
ject. This involved a substantial rise in the Royal Government of Bhutan's 
revenue earnings from the CHP. <br><br>
 
     India continued to cooperate with Bhutan in various other fields such as 

telecommunications, livestock breeding, dairying, mini hydel projects, rural 
 
                            <br>pg4<br> 
 
development, health services, forestry, industrial estates, road building and 

maintenance and education. 
 
     India continued to offer Bhutanese students opportunities for secondary as
 
well as higher education and training in various fields such as medicine, 
engineering and the humanities, plus specialised training in work connected wit
h 
police, customs and defence. About 50 Bhutanese students were availing of the 

Government of India scholarship, and an equal number of additional scholarships
 
for studies in India were also extended to them under the Colombo Plan. 
Increasing attention was being paid to human resource development as a key 
area of bilateral cooperation. 
 
     India continued to supply Bhutan, at the Royal Government of Bhutan's 
request, with essential commodities such as wheat, rice, sugar, coal, steel, ed
ible 
oils etc at controlled prices under a special quota system. <br><br>
 
     There was a steady improvement in Indo-Bangladesh relations during the yea
r 
under review. The visit of the Bangladesh Foreign Minister to India in May 
imparted a positive momentum to them and a meeting of the Indo-Bangladesh 
joint Economic Commission was held in May in New Delhi after a gap of seven 
years. India announced a Rs 30 crore Government to Government credit to 
Bangladesh. The meetings of the joint Rivers Commission were reactivated and 
detailed discussions were held for working out a comprehensive long term 
solution to the problem of sharing the waters of common rivers. During the 
SAARC Summit in Male in November, President Ershad and the Prime Minister, 
Shri Chandra Shekhar had a cordial meeting. 
 
     Following two months of a sustained opposition agitation launched by the 

students and joined in by a wide cross section of Bangladesh society-President 

Ershad resigned on 6 December and handed over power to Mr Shahabuddin 
Ahmed, the Chief justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court, who assumed office as
 
the Acting President of Bangladesh. Elections for Parliament were held on 
27 February 1991. 
 
     The restoration of the democratic rights of the people of Bangladesh was a
 
welcome development and India is looking forward to working closely with a 
democratically elected Government in Bangladesh. 
 
     In July 1990, the military regime of Myanmar held elections in which the 

National League for Democracy (NLD) won an overwhelming mandate. 
 
                            <br>pg5<br>
 
     It was expected that the power would thereafter be transferred to the elec
ted 
representatives of the people. However, this did not happen and, at the end of 

the year, Myanmar's military Government appeared determined to continue in 
office for an indefinite period of time. While maintaining the policy of strict
 non- 
interference in Myanmar's internal affairs, India expressed its support to the 

democratic aspirations of the people of Myanmar and hoped that the electoral 
verdict would be respected by the country's military leadership. 
 
     The Government of India's objectives in Sri Lanka are: striving for the sa
fety 
and security of the Tamils in Sri Lanka; fostering the process of political sol
ution 
through dialogue as the only basis for the resolution of the ethnic issue; 
contributing to peace and normalcy in Sri Lanka; and to restore Indo-Sri Lankan
 
relations to traditional levels of cordiality and friendship. The visit of the 
then 
External Affairs Minister to Colombo in January 1991 came in this perspective. 

 <br><br>
     The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, to which the Government stands committed, 
led to the enactment of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, 
which for the first time provided a basis for the devolution of political power
 to 
the Tamils through the system of Provincial Councils and related legislation. 

Withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in March 1990 brought to an end 
India's direct involvement in Sri Lanka and led to a new phase in Indo-Sri Lank
an 
relations. 
 
     The Government of India are extremely concerned at the outbreak of 
hostilities between LTTE and Sri Lankan armed forces which have led to civilian
 
suffering and casualties. This has also led to an influx of refugees into Tamil
 
Nadu which now stands at 122,972. These concerns have been conveyed by 
India to the Sri Lankan Government during the visit of the then Minister for 
External Affairs from 28 to 31 January 1991. 
 
     During his visit, the then External Affairs Minister called on the Preside
nt, the 
Prime Minister, the Speaker and other senior Cabinet Ministers of Sri Lanka and
 
also met all shades of political and public opinion there. He also met 
representatives of all non-LTTE Tamil Groups and the President of the Ceylon 
Workers Congress representing largely the interests of persons of Indian origin
, 
particularly those covered by the Srimavo-Shastri Agreement. 
 
                             <br>pg6<br> 
 
    The Government of India believe that only a negotiated political settlement
 
which takes into account the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Tamils c
an 
bring lasting peace to the island. The political settlement must be finally arr
ived 
at between the Government and the Tamils of Sri Lanka. India has advocated for 

the cessation of hostilities and a return to dialogue. These views were conveye
d 
to Sri Lanka Government during the then External Affairs Minister's visit there
. 
The visit also served to underline the desire for strengthening and consolidati
ng 
bilateral ties. It was agreed to upgrade the present Joint Economic Commission 

to that of a joint Commission at Foreign Minister's level. <br><br>
 
    The close and friendly relations between India and Maldives were further 
strengthened by high level visits. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom visited 
New Delhi in March 1990. It was followed by the former Prime Minister, Shri V 

P Singh's visit to Male, the first after assuming office, from 22 to 24 June 19
90. 
Fresh impetus and content were given to the multi-faceted Indo-Maldivian 
cooperation which now encompasses health and welfare, infrastructure projects, 

defence, manpower resource development, civil aviation, communication and 
trade. Construction of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital with Indian 
assistance is underway. It was also decided to set up a vocational training cen
tre 
at an estimated cost of Rs 5 crores. 
 
    Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar had bilateral discussions with President 
Gayoom during his visit to Male from 21 to 23 November 1990 for the Fifth 
SAARC Summit. 
 
    President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom again visited India from 25 to 27 January 
1991 as the Chief Guest at the Republic Day 1991 celebrations. He was 
accompanied by a high level delegation including Maldivian Foreign Minister. At
 
the delegation level talks held by President Gayoom with Prime Minister Chandra
 
Shekhar the entire gamut of bilateral relations was discussed. New areas of 
cooperation were considered. It was decided to review the 1981 Bilateral Trade 

Agreement. President Gayoom and Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar also 
exchanged views on the Gulf crisis and expressed their deep sorrow and concern 

over the loss of lives and human suffering caused by the hostilities. They 
expressed the hope that escalation and intensification of the conflict will be 

prevented and that all efforts will be made for a peaceful solution in conformi
ty 
with the UN Security Council Resolutions. <br><br>
 
                              pg7<br><br>
 
    During the year under review, India continued her endeavours to develop 
tension free and good neighbourly relations with Pakistan on the basis of the 

Simla Agreement. 
 
    The bilateral relationship had unfortunately come under severe strain on 
account of Pakistan's continued aid and abetment of terrorism directed 
against India in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Ms was accompanied by 
inflammatory statements made by Pakistani leaders, in which efforts were also 

made to deliberately misrepresent the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. 
India conveyed in unequivocal terms to Pakistan that the latter's continued 
support to terrorism directed against India was not only in contravention of 
the Simla Agreement and of universally accepted norms of inter-State conduct, 

but also adversely affected any confidence-building in bilateral relationship. 

It also worked against the long term interest of peace and stability in the 
region. 
 
     The then External Affairs Minister, Shri I K Gujral had a meeting with 
Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan in New York on 25 April 
1990. It was agreed in the meeting that tension should be reduced and 
confrontation avoided. The Directors General of Military Operations of India 
and Pakistan should remain in touch with each other and both sides should 
exercise restraint and keep channels of communication open. <br><br>
 
     In order to reduce tensions and allay fears of confrontation, India Pro- 

posed a package of Confidence Building Measures including both military and 
nonmilitary elements to Pakistan on 28 May 1990. Pursuant to this, three 
rounds of Foreign Secretary level talks were held between India and Pakistan. 

The discussions took place from 17 to 20 July (Islamabad), 9 to 12 
August (New Delhi) and 18 to 20 December (Islamabad). It was pointed 
out to Pakistan that the root cause of the present tensions between the two 
countries was Pakistan's support to terrorist activities directed against India
 in 
Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. For any meaningful and sustained improve- 
ment in India-Pakistan relations this support must stop. 
 
    The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan, Shri Chandra Shekhar and Mr 
Nawaz Sharif, had a fruitful and constructive exchange of views in the Mal- 
dives on 22 November 1990, on the occasion of the SAARC Summit. The 
two Prime Ministers decided that all differences should be resolved peacefully 

and through dialogue. Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar reiterated India's 
position on Pakistan's interference in her internal affairs. The two Prime Mini
sters 
 
                            <br>pg8<br>
 
agreed to remain in touch with each other. A 'hotline' has been established 
between the Prime Ministers of the two countries. 
 
     The third round of Talks between the Foreign Secretaries  was guided by th
e 
directives of the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan, following their meetin
g in 
the Maldives on 22 November 1990. During the talks, it was decided to exchange,
 
in January 199 1, the Instruments of Ratification of the Agreement on Prohibiti
on of 
Attack against Nuclear. Installations and Facilities which was signed on 31 
December 1988 and subsequently ratified by both Governments. The Instruments 
of Ratification were exchanged on 27 January 1991 and the Agreement came into 

effect from that date. Decisions were also taken to hold the next meeting of th
e 
Surveyors General of India and Pakistan for demarcation of land boundary in Sir
 
Creek, and to resume thereafter the discussions on the Tulbal Navigation Projec
t. 
Surveyors General of India and Pakistan met in New Delhi from 23 to 26 March 
1991. The meeting held in a better understanding of each other's perception. As
 a 
means of reducing tension between the two countries, it was agreed that the 
Directors General of Military Operations of Pakistan and India would keep in 
telephonic touch with each other on a weekly basis. This has already been 
initiated. The meetings of the Sub Commissions of India-Pakistan joint Commissi
on 
are to be resumed at an appropriate time. It was also agreed that the next meet
ing 
of the Foreign Secretaries would be held in New Delhi at mutually convenient 
dates. This would be preceded by a meeting of the experts to finalise the pendi
ng 
drafts of (i) the Agreement on Advance Notice of Military Exercises and 
Manoeuvres and (ii) the Agreement on Prevention of Air Space Violation by 
Military Aircraft. <br><br>
 
  There was some concern in India on account of recent reports regarding 
developments in Pakisan's weapons oriented and clandestine nuclear programme. 

Speaking in Parliament on 7 January 1991, the Prime Minister had expressed the 

hope that Pakistan would not indulge in any misadventure. Should it do so, Indi
a 
has the capability to meet the challenge, in whatever form it may arise. 
 
  The Government of India hoped that Pakistan would join India in its 
endeavour to normalise relations and to promote peace and stability in the regi
on. 
 
  The conflict in Afghanistan, unfortunately, continued during the year. Period
i- 
cally, foreign backed rebels mounted attacks on the cities in Afghanistan, but 

without much success. Over the year, various peace proposals were initiated; 
discussions were also held between the USA and the USSR to find a political 
solution to the crisis. 
 
                           <br><br>pg9<br> 
 
  India closely followed developments and maintained contacts with all those 
concerned with the situation in Afghanistan. India is for a political settlemen
t of 
the problem arrived at by the Afghans themselves without external intervention 

and interference, and which takes into account the existing realities and legit
imate 
interests of all concerned. India supports the preservation of Afghanistan's st
atus 
as a sovereign, non-aligned and independent country. 
 
  In the sphere of bilateral relations, there was a regular high level exchange
 of 
visits between India and Afghanistan. The Afghan President, Dr Najibullah visit
ed 
India in August 1990. During this visit, agreements on Prevention of Traffickin
g 
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Cooperation between Agricultural
 
Institutions, and Cultural Exchanges were signed. The 9th Session of the Indo- 

Afghan joint Commission was held on 12 and 13 June 1990. This meeting was 
co-chaired by the Foreign Ministers of India and Afghanistan. A comprehensive 

protocol envisaging cooperation in areas ranging from agriculture to commodity 

assistance and telecommunications was signed during the meeting. Foreign 
Minister of Afghanistan, Mr Abdul Wakil, during his official visit to India fro
m 7 to 
9 February 1991, met the President and the Prime Minister, and also had 
discussions with the then External Affairs Minister on bilateral, regional and 

international issues of mutual interest with special focus on the Gulf crisis. 

 
  The then Minister for Commerce, Law and justice visited Afghanistan from 30 

December 1990 to 1 January 1991. <br><br>
 
  With the finalisation of the dates and venue for the Fifth Summit, the pace o
f 
SAARC activities registered an increase. This was especially true of the Techni
cal 
Committees in the twelve agreed areas of cooperation. Most of these Committees 

had not been convened in the earlier part of 1990 due to there being indecision
 
about their Chairpersons. With the finalisation of the Summit dates, it was als
o 
decided that Chairpersonship would continue to vest with the countries who were
 
already vested with a particular charge during the year 1989. 
 
  Broadly, India's stance on SAARC matters during the year was characterised by
 
the following principles: <br><br>
 
<br>(a)  Emphasis was laid on the need to introduce tangible cooperation in 
     SAARC by focussing attention on core economic sectors; 
 
<br><br>(b)  A realistic approach was adopted in matters relating to the setting up of 

 
                              <br>pg10<br> 
 
    Regional Centres etc. In almost all such cases India recommended that 
    rather than setting up of such centres, which could drain the limited 
    resources of SAARC countries, member countries should explore the 
    possibility of establishing networking arrangements between relevant 
    institutions in the SAARC regions; and 
 
<br><br>(c) AR efforts were made to keep SAARC initiatives anchored to the 
    objective of achieving collective self-reliance within the region. 
 
  Under the Integrated Programme of Action in the twelve agreed areas of 
cooperation, a total number of 86 SAARC activities/events were held in SAARC 
countries during the years 1989 and 1990 ie, during the period intervening 
between the Fourth and the Fifth Summits. Of these, 26 activities were 
organized in India. Three events/activities were held in January 1991. Of 
these, two were organized in India. 
 
  The culmination of all such activities was the Fifth SAARC Summit held in the
 
Maldives which took place in accordance with the following schedule: 
 
<br><br>(i)   Eighth Meeting of the Programming Committee (13 and 14 November 
      1990); 
 
<br><br>(ii)  Thirteenth Meeting of the Standing Committee of Foreign 
      Secretaries (15 to 17 November 1990); 
 
<br><br>(iii) Eighth Meeting of the Council of Ministers (18 and 19 November 
      1990); aid 
 
<br><br>(iv)  Fifth Meeting (Summit) of Heads of State/Government (21 to 23 
      November 1990). 
 
  During the Summit meeting at Mate, a general emphasis was laid on the 
streamlining of SAARC programmes and activities. Ms guideline was diligently 
implemented by the Programming Committee at the time of formulating the 
SAARC Calendar of Activities for the year 1991. Many of the events recom- 
mended by the various Technical Committees were deleted by the Programming 
Committee either because there had not been adequate response from member 
countries or in favour of other activities which pertained to new themes/hi-tec
h 
subjects etc. Generally speaking, the Technical Committees instead of spreading
 
their field too wide, were asked to concentrate on fewer programmes of better 

 
                            <br>pg11<br> 
 
quality. The Presidents of Maldives and Bangladesh were asked to hold 
consultations with other member countries on the question of adopting a more 
business-like and functional approach in the SAARC meetings. 
 
  The Fifth SAARC Summit took the following major decisions: 
 
<br><br>(i)    A SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
       was signed in Male at the Foreign Secretaries level. The Convention is 

       an important step in eliminating the scourge of Drug Trafficking and 
       Drug Abuse from the region; 
 
<br><br>(ii)   It was decided to set up new Regional Centres for the SAARC 
       region-(a) a Tuberculosis Centre at Kathmandu to reduce the fatal 
       disease in the region; (b) a Nucleus Human Resource Development 
       Centre in Pakistan for qualitative improvement in the human skills of 
       the people of the region; and (c) a Documentation Centre in India for 
       collection, publication and dissemination of information of technical 
       and scientific nature, including the social science, published in or upon 
       the SAARC region; 
 
<br><br>(iii)  It was decided to launch the Special SAARC Travel Document which 
       would entitle members of National Parliaments, Supreme Court Judges 
       and Heads of National Academic Institutions, their spouses and depen- 
       dent children, to visa-free travel within the region; 
 
<br><br>(iv)   In order to focus attention and redress the grave problem of shelter it 

       was decided to work together during 1991 which will be known as 
       "SAARC Year of Shelter." During the year 1992, it was decided to 
       concentrate through "SAARC Year of Environment," on problems facing 
       the region on the vital issues of environmental degradation and its 
       adverse impact on future generations. There are a large number of 
       disabled and physically handicapped people in the region for whose 
       welfare it was decided to work together during 1993, the "SAARC Year 
       of the Handicapped;" 
 
<br><br>(v)    It was decided to complete the Regional Study on Trade, Manufactures 
       and Services through which a blueprint of regional economic coopera- 
       tion will be charted, by the end of February 1991. This would mark 
       the beginning of a new phase of economic cooperation in SAARC, 
       which alone can make a difference to the daily lives of the people of 
 
                             <br>pg12 <br>
 
       the region. It was decided to set up a Fund for Identification and 
       Development of Regional Projects which will be financed through 
       SAARC national development banks. This Fund, once established, will 
       enable the starting up of joint ventures of economic cooperation in the 

       region. Likewise, it was decided to set up joint ventures in the field 

       of Cottage Industries and Handicrafts as these activities have extensive
 
       scope for employment generation of large number of unemployed 
       youth; 
 
<br><br>(vi)   It was decided that India will host the Second Ministerial Meeting in 
       1991, to review the outcome of Uruguay Round and to coordinate the 
       positions of SAARC countries at international conferences including the 

       UN Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992. 
       This meeting will also address itself to the objectives of attaining 
       individual and collective self-reliance in the region; 
 
<br><br>(vii)  It was decided to extend scientific and technical cooperation further 
       into the fields of Biotechnology for attaining long term food security o
f 
       the South Asian countries as well as for medicinal purposes; and 
 
<br><br>(WU)   On the initiative of the Government of Sri Lanka, it was decided to 
       promote tourism to the SAARC region from outside and to promote 
       institutionalised cooperation among SAARC tourist industries. 
 
  The Male Summit can be credited with substantial achievements. However, it 
hardly bears reiteration that only strong and clear political will can enable t
he 
SAARC countries to move confidently in the new areas of cooperation identified 

by it. India is committed to South Asian cooperation under SAARC which she 
feels is essential for accelerating the economic development, for building indi
- 
vidual and collective self-reliance and for enhancing the SAARC countries' 
bargaining strength in multilateral associations. Such cooperation has become a
ll 
the more necessary in the context of the recent trends towards economic 
integration in the world, added to which the Gulf crisis may even have made 
cooperation vita or SAA countries' very survival. India, consistent with her 
size, resources and stage of development, is pledged to take on all the 
responsibilities necessary to make SAARC an effective and fullfledged instrumen
t of 
regional cooperation.

  THE importance that India attaches to maintaining and expanding close and 
friendly relations with the countries in South-East Asia and the South Pacific 
is 
testified by the high level contacts and frequency of interaction with these 
countries. 
 
  Relations with Cambodia continued to be close and friendly. Prime Minister 
Hun Sen paid a working visit to India from 7 to Oct 11, 1990, and met the 
former Prime Minister, the then External Affairs Minister and other Ministers. 

Discussions were held on bilateral issues as well as on prospects for the 
resolution of the Cambodian conflicts. Prime Minister Hun Sen stressed the 
importance of India continuing to play a role in the Cambodian settlement, and

 of 
extending more food aid to Cambodia. <br><br>
 
  India continued to play an active and constructive role to achieve a peaceful
 
negotiated settlement in Cambodia through frequent official interaction and 
consultations with leaders in concerned countries. Discussions on a Cambodian 

settlement continued in various fora including regional meetings, and meetings 
of 
the Five Permanent members of the UN Security Council (P-5). A framework for 
a settlement based on a major UN role in governing Cambodia in the interim 
period leading upto elections has been formulated. India was actively involved 

 
                             <br>pg14<br>
 
in discussions on this proposal, and expressed her concern on a number of issue
s, 
including the need for the settlement to be consistent with respect for Cambodi
a's 
sovereignty. The importance of these concerns has been acknowledged.

  Relations with Australia which were progressing well, received a temporary 
setback when in April Australia announced the sale of 50 mothballed but air- 
worthy Mirage III aircraft along with an unspecified number of engines and spar
es 
to Pakistan worth approximately Australian $ 35 million. India conveyed her 
concern at the timing of the decision which would not send a message of restrai
nt 
to Pakistan at a time when tensions between India and Pakistan were. high and 

pointed out that the Australian decision was contrary to their announced foreig
n 
policy objective of reducing tension in the region. To emphasize her concern, 

India limited bilateral exchanges. Foreign Minister Evans came to India in Augu
st 
in an attempt to assure the Government of India that the contract would be 
reviewed in the event of hostilities breaking out or becoming imminent. He also
 
implied that the actual delivery would not take place till the end of 1990 or e
arly 
1991. Despite these assurances, shipments got underway in October. The 
official spokesman issued a strongly worded statement conveying India's concern
. 
 
  The traditionally friendly relations between India and New Zealand were 
maintained.<br><br> 
 
  Developments in Fiji continued to cause concern. On 23 May 1990, the 
"interim Government" of Fiji asked India to close her Mission in Suva because o
f 
allegedly "unfriendly and unwarranted acts." In accordance with international 

practice, India closed her Mission the next day and made arrangements to 
repatriate the India-based staff. Following the closure of the Mission in Suva,
 
India's Missions in Canberra, Wellington and Sydney were authorised to maintain
 
 
                            <br>pg18<br> 
 
contact with the Indian community in Fiji, as well as those who have migrated t
o 
New Zealand and Australia since the two military coups. 
 
  In August 1990, the illegal regime in Fiji promulgated a new Constitution 
subverting the 1970 Constitution which came into force at the time of independ-
 
ence. The National Federation Party (NFP) and Fiji Labour Party (FLP) 
Coalition, which won the last free and fair elections in Fiji, condemned the ne
w 
Constitution as racist, feudal and undemocratic. India strongly condemned the 

promulgation of the new Constitution. 
 
  India continues to extend moral support to all democratic forces committed 
to maintain racial equality and social harmony in Fiji. A high level delegation
 of 
coalition leaders visited India in September 1990 and met the then External Aff
airs 
Minister and other Ministers. The delegation participated in seminars and meeti
ngs 
with intellectuals and academics, and also visited Patna and Lucknow. 
 
  Following the abduction and torture of a senior academic of Indian origin by 

the Fijian Police in October, India issued a strong statement condemning the 
autocratic suppression of legitimate democratic dissent in Fiji. 
 
  The ban on trade, economic and technical cooperation with Fiji continued. 
However, India has decided to continue to provide scholarships to Fijian 
students of Indian origin, and to increase the number of these scholarships. 
The cases would be processed through the Missions in Australia and New 
Zealand. <br><br>
 
  India has been lobbying with concerned Commonwealth countries against 
the present regime in Fiji, and has also taken up the issue in international fo
ra 
including the United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Sub Commission 
for Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, the Human Rights
 
Commission and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
(ESCAP). India also supported the efforts of the NFP-FLP Coalition to present 

its case at the South Pacific Forum Summit meeting in August 1990. 
 
  The President of Nauru, Mr Bernard Dowiyogo, visited India between 
December 1990 and January 1991 to discuss their investment in the Paradeep 
 
                             <br>pg19<br> 
 
Phosphates Ltd plant in Orissa. Indo-Nauru Friendship Association, established 
in 
1990, released a souvenir commemorating the President's visit. 
 
  The High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to India, resident in Malaysia, 
presented his credentials on 22 January 1991.

  DURING the year under review, there was further improvement in the dia- 
logue between India and China on matters of mutual interest. India's policy 
towards China, which aims at seeking a peaceful resolution of outstanding issue
s in 
a fair and reasonable manner, was an important focus of Government's concerns. 

 
  The factors of continuity and consensus of approach within the country to 
India's China policy were stressed in the political level dialogue, particularl
y 
during the visits of the Deputy Prime Minister to China in May 1990 and the 
Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Qian Qichen to India in March 1990. India's 
commitment to further consolidating and improving the atmosphere of under- 
standing established following the Prime Ministerial visit to China in December
 
1988, was emphasized. The high level political dialogue gathered further 
momentum with the visit of the then External Affairs Minister, Shri Vidya Chara
n 
Shukla to China in February 1991.<br><br> 
 
  The Chinese Premier, Mr Li Peng in a message of felicitation addressed to Shr
i 
Chandra Shekhar upon his assumption of the office of Prime Minister in November
 
1990, expressed the hope that bilateral relations between the two countries wil
l 
be continuously improved and developed on the basis of Five Principles of 
Peaceful Coexistence. Shri Chandra Shekhar reciprocated these sentiments and 
underlined the Government of India's desire to provide greater momentum to the 

process of dialogue and understanding initiated between the two countries in 
recent times. <br><br>
 
  The dialogue and interaction with China was marked by cordiality and 
frankness. Efforts were made to intensify bilateral ties in various fields to 

 
                              <br>pg21<br> 
 
strengthen cooperation on multilateral issues of concern to India and China as 
two 
large developing countries representing two fifths of the world's population, a
nd 
also to engage in a candid and comprehensive discussion on issues affecting the
 
region. Both India and China resolved to cooperate in seeking a peaceful and 
early settlement of the conflict in the Gulf. 
 <br><br>
  The fortieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
 
India and the People's Republic of China was observed in April 1990. Messages 

of greetings were exchanged between the two countries at the level of the 
President, the Prime Minister and the then External Affairs Minister. Art 
exhibitions and cultural troupes were also exchanged in commemoration of the 
event. 
 
  The visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Qian Qichen in March 1990 
provided both sides with the opportunity to have a detailed exchange of views o
n 
matters of bilateral, regional and international concern. Discussions held duri
ng the 
visit vielded a better understanding of the perceptions of each country. 
 
  Discussions during the visit of the then External Affairs Minister to China f
rom 
1 to Feb 06, 1991 took place in a positive and friendly atmosphere. This Was 
evident during the discussions held with the Chinese Foreign Minister, and duri
ng 
meetings with Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Wu Xueqian. There was an 
exchange of views on a wide range of bilateral, regional and international issu
es. <br><br>
The Chinese side assessed relations with India as having improved "markedly." 

Significant outcomes of this visit were the decision to restore Consulates Gene
ral 
of the two countries in Shanghai and Bombay and to resume border trade. 
 
  The Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, Shri Devi Lal visited 
China in April. During his visit, Shri Devi Lal met the then Acting Premier, Mr
 
Yao Yilin, and held intensive discussions on agricultural cooperation with the 
then 
Chinese Minister for Agriculture, Mr He Kang. India's continued commitment to 

seeking a negotiated settlement of the boundary question in consonance with 
national interests and national sentiments was conveyed to the Chinese Govern- 

ment. Key areas for future agricultural cooperation such as hybrid rice 
cultivation, integrated fish-paddy culture, plasticulture, cotton-seed producti
on, 
dryland farming, dairy development. and exchange of various germplasms were 
 
                            <br>pg22<br> 
 
identified. A blueprint for such cooperation was then drawn up during the visit
 of 
the Chinese Vice Minister for Agriculture, Mr Wang Zhenliang to India in Octobe
r. 
 
  The second meeting of the Joint Working Group on the boundary question, 
followed by consultations at the Foreign Office level, took place in New. Delhi
 in 
end August 1990. The Chinese delegation was led by Vice Foreign Minister, Mr Qi
 
Huaiyuan. The Indian delegation was led by the Foreign Secretary, Shri 
Muchkund Dubey. Discussions covered the principles and parameters which 
should govern an overall and comprehensive settlement of the boundary question.
 
The meeting resulted in a clearer perception of views held by each side in rega
rd 
to the approach to a negotiated settlement. The need for a practical and realis
tic 
approach was stressed by the Indian side. Both sides expressed the hope that by
 
working in a sincere and forward looking manner, it would be possible to arrive
 at 
a negotiated solution to the boundary question. During the visit of the then 
External Affairs Minister to China, it was resolved that next meeting of the jo
int 
Working Group would take place not later than June 1991. <br><br>
 
  The second meeting of the Joint Working Group also resulted in agreement 
on a mechanism for maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas. This
 
mechanism envisages the holding of periodic meetings between the border

o 
China. During the visit of Secretary (Culture), a new Cultural Exchange 
Programme for 1991 to 1993 was finalised, providing also for an expansion in th
e 
number of scholarships offered to students of both countries. 
 
  Cordial and friendly relations between India and Japan which received a new 

impetus in the mid-80s were further intensified during the year under review. 

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited India between April and May 1990. 
Significantly, he chose India to begin his tour of South Asian nations and util
ised 
the opportunity in his address to both the Houses of Parliament to expound the 

"New International Cooperation Initiative." 
 
  President R Venkataraman represented India at the formal Enthronement 
Ceremony of Emperor Akihito in November 1990.<br><br> 
 
  Bilateral interaction between the two countries continued in all spheres 
including the political, economic, scientific, technological and cultural field
s. 
The then Industry Minister, Shri Ajit Singh and the then Commerce and Tourism 

Minister, Shri Arun Nehru visited Japan to explore the possibility of greater 

Japanese investment in India as also to explain India's industrial policy and t
ourist 
and commercial potential respectively. They utilised the opportunity to interac
t 
with a broad spectrum of Japanese community, particularly the business commun- 

ity in addition to meeting Ministerial counterparts. <br><br>
 
  Other areas where bilateral contacts and linkages were maintained are: 
 
<br><br>(i)   The Indo-Japan Foreign Office Bilateral Consultative Talks in New Delhi 

      in February 1991 afforded both sides an opportunity for 
      productive and frank exchange of views on issues ranging from the 
      current international situation, including the Gulf war, developments in 

      Europe, East-West relations, regional matters particularly relations with
 
      India's neighbours, and most important, the bilateral relations; 
 
<br><br>(ii)  The 19th meeting of the India-Japan joint Study Committee deliberated 
      on several aspects of relationship and suggested the possibility of 
      establishing an industrial model town in India with Japanese participa- 

      tion; 
 
                             <br>pg24<br> 
 
<br><br>(iii) The 8th official level trade talks focussing on both bilateral and 
      multilateral issues particularly with reference to Uruguay Round of 
      Trade Negotiations; and 
 
<br><br>(iv)  Two meetings of the Indo-Japan Working Group on Railways for 
      furthering cooperation with Japan and for receiving technical assistance 

      for the upgradation and improvement of India's railway system. 
 
  India participated in several exhibitions/conferences held in Japan, in field
s as 
diverse as Science and Technology and Horticulture, the most significant being:
 
 
<br><br>(a)   A Software India-90 Conference with participation by both Indian 
      Government and leading Indian Software firms; and 
 
<br><br>(b)   Successful participation at the six-month long Osaka Garden and 
      Greenery Exposition which drew large crowds and won several awards. 
 
  Japan continued to remain India's largest aid donor and pledged Yen 104,826 

million as Official Development Assistance to India for fiscal year 1990 crossi
ng for 
the first time the Yen 100 billion mark, at the Aid India Consortium meeting in
 
Paris in June. On 23 January 1991 seven loan agreements totalling Yen 129.205 

billion were signed in Tokyo, of which six were covered under ODA pledge for 
1990 while the seventh for Yen 24.379 billion was for the Power System 
Improvement and Small Hydro Electric Project which formed part of the 1989 
fiscal year ODA package. <br><br>
 
  Friendly relations with the Republic of Korea continued. A Special Envoy of 

President Roh Tae Woo, Ambassador Roh Jae Won, visited India with a special 
message to the Prime Minister and to explain his country's Nord-Politick. This 

visit was preceded by ROK Foreign Minister Choi Ho Joong's visit to India in 
March 1990. The visit envisaged greater growth in bilateral trade, economic 
relations and scientific and technological exchanges. 
 
  The traditional Parliamentary contacts with the Republic of Korea continued 

with the visit of an 11 member Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of t
he 
National Assembly, Mr Park Jyun Kyu to India from 6 to 11 January 1991 at the 

invitation of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The South Korean Parliamentarians 

met the Vice President and the Prime Minister. They also had fruitful exchanges
 
with their Indian counterparts. 
 
                             <br>pg25<br> 
 
  There was close interaction at both the official and non-official levels. In 
the 
economic and commercial fields, bilateral relations received a boost with the v
isit 
of a 25 member South Korean delegation led by the Chairman of the Indo-Korean 

Economic Cooperation Committee for the 8th joint Conference in New Delhi. 
The Conference highlighted the fact that there was ample scope for intensifying
 
future areas of cooperation and collaboration. With 1989 bilateral trade betwee
n 
India and the Republic of Korea at US $ 930 million--comprising less than 1 per
 
cent of the ROK's total trade turnover, there was room for both India and the 

Republic of Korea to improve the volume of trade both ways from areas as divers
e 
as consumer goods, electronics, automobiles and footwear to other areas such as
 
computer software, oil drilling and deep sea fishing. <br><br>
 
  With the far-reaching economic and political changes and re-alignments 
having taken place in the erstwhile Communist nations of Europe, the Democratic
 
People's Republic of Korea turned increasingly to traditionally friendly countr
ies 
like India which is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. DPRK Vice 
Foreign Minister Cho Gyu 11 visited India for discussions on bilateral matters 
and 
matters of international and mutual interests. Contacts at other levels were 
maintained and bilateral relations remained cordial and steady. Former Presiden
t 
Giani Zail Singh visited Pyongyang as a Guest of the Workers Party of Korea as 
also 
several Parliamentarians to attend the 45th anniversary of the founding of the 

Party. Contacts in the scientific, technological and cultural fields were also 

maintained.<br><br> 
 
  India's age old and friendly relations with the Mongolian People's Republic 

were reaffirmed with modern linkages. Mongolia introduced major political 
changes and far-reaching economic reforms in 1990 when she opted for 
democracy. In view of the close relations with Mongolia, India sent an Observer
 
to the first multi-party elections held in July 1990. 
 
  Interaction and contacts at all levels and in the fields of science and 
technology, economic and commerce, and culture were intensified. Particularly 

significant was the visit of Dr J Batsuuri, Minister for National Development o
f 
Mongolia who had detailed and extensive exchanges with, Ministerial counterpart
s, 
academics and scientists to explore further areas of cooperation between the tw
o 
countries. Other distinguished visitors included the Ministers of Law and Healt
h, 
the former came to study the structure and functioning of India's legislature a
nd 
parliamentary processes.

in March 1990 to receive the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Under- 
standing. He briefed the Indian leaders on the situation prevailing in the 
occupied territories and various initiatives taken by him to promote positive 

climate for resumption. of the West Asian peace process. India assured him of 

her firm and unequivocal support for the Palestinian cause. During the visit, 

degree of Doctor of Science was also conferred on President Arafat by Jamia Mil

Islamia. Three Special Envoys of Presided Arafat, Dr Suleman Daodi, Dr Salman 

Hirfi and Mr Jamal Sourani also visited India in June and October 1990 and Janu
ary- 
February 1991 respectively. India espoused the Palestinian cause in all bilater

he 
Iraqi attack and occupation of Kuwait including the evacuation of Indians from 

Iraq and Kuwait which was mainly through Jordan. The then Minister for 
Surface Transport, Shri K P Unnikrishnan visited Jordan in September 1990 to 
supervise the evacuation arrangements. The Government of Jordan extended full 

cooperation and assistance and provided all required facilities without which 

India's efforts to evacuate such a large number of people in such a short time 

would have been severely handicapped. Apart from ad hoc relief supplies, the 
Government of India donated Rs 1 crore worth of medicines and foodstuffs for us
e 
in the refugee camps in Jordan. A medical team was also sent to assist the 
Jordanian Government in providing medical assistance. From Jordan Mr Nabil 
Abdul Huda, Minister of Transport visited India in July 1990 for Indo-Jordanian
 
Civil Aviation talks. Visits of other official level delegations were also exch

  Indo-Iranian relations are a factor of stability and peace in this region. 
During the year, bilateral cooperation continued to assume greater significance
 
 
                             <br>pg28 <br>
 
against the back drop of the tensions and the potentials of conflict which had 

appeared in the region and in the rapidly changing international environment. 

 
  Iran was currently addressing itself to the gigantic task of national reconst
ruc-

  Foreign Ministers of both the countries had a fruitful exchange of views in 

April and September 1990 encompassing all issues of bilateral relations. Politi

  Iraq's invasion, military occupation and annexation of Kuwait in August 1990 

was a matter of great concern for India. India reiterated in unambiguous terms 

its well known position against the use or threat of use of force to settle 
differences in inter-state relations and called for unconditional withdrawal of
 Iraqi 
troops from Kuwait so that the independence and sovereignty of Kuwait is 
 
                          <br>pg30 <br>
 
restored. India fully subscribed to and faithfully abided by all the resolution
s of 
the UN Security Council in this regard, despite the cost to her economy resulti
ng 
from the compliance with Security Council Resolution 661 imposing economic 
sanctions against Iraq. 
 
  India which has for ages maintained close and cordial relations with both 
Kuwait and Iraq, exerted herself to the utmost to seek a non-military resolutio
n to 
the Gulf crisis. The then External Affairs Minister visited Moscow, Washing- 
ton, Amman and Baghdad in August 1990. From Baghdad he went to Kuwait to 
meet with the Indian community there, estimated at 172,000. In September 
1990, he visited Belgrade, Rome and The Hague for further consultations on the 

Gulf crisis. 
 <br><br>
  A number of special envoys were sent and received in the context of search 
for a peaceful resolution to the Gulf crisis. Dr Najma Heptullah, Deputy 
Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, visited Saudi Arabia in December 1990 as a Spec
ial 
Envoy of Prime Minister where she met the Crown Prince. Subsequently she went 

to Taif and met the Crown Prince of Kuwait. There were two Special Envoys from 

Kuwait, Dr Rasheed Al-Ameeri (September 1990) and Dr Abdul Rehman Abdullah 
Al-Awadhi, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs (February 1991). Dr Mohammed 

Sa'eed Al-Sahhaf, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Iraq visited India a
s Special 
Envoy of President of Iraq in January 1991. Visits were also paid to India by M
r 
Mohsin Al-Hamdani, Minister of State for Environment as a Special Envoy of Prim
e 
Minister of Yemen, Mr ST Debagha, as Special Envoy of President of Algeria 
(January 1991), Mr jamal Sourani as Personal Envoy of President Yasser Arafat 

(January-February 1991) and Mr Mohamed Ibrahim Massoud, Minister of State as 
Special Envoy of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in February 1991.<br><br> 
 
  Even when the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the crisis appeared 
rather bleak, as the deadline set for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait by UN Secur
ity 
Council Resolution 678 approached, Prime Minister addressed a personal com- 
munication to the Presidents of the United States and the Soviet Union urging 

them to give peace one more chance. A similar communication was addressed 
to the President of Yugoslavia, Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. <br><br>
 
  Following the outbreak of hostilities on 17 January 1991, Prime Minister 
issued a statement suggesting a three point plan for restoration of peace. it 

envisaged: 
 
<br><br>(i)   Appeal to President Saddam Hussein to announce the commencement 
 
                              <br>pg31 <br>
 
      of immediate withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait in keeping with the 
      Security Council resolutions; 
 
<br><br>(ii)  to be followed by a cessation of hostilities; and 
 
<br><br>(iii) resumption of efforts to find peaceful solution to the conflict, the 
      modalities of which could be worked out by the Security Council. 
 
  India has always believed that the Non-Aligned Movement has a significant 
contribution to make in resolving international crises such as the Gulf crisis.
 
When the then External Affairs Minister visited Belgrade in September 1990, 
consultations took place between India, Algeria and Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, 

the efforts of the Non-Aligned Movement to seek a nonmilitary resolution of the
 
crisis did not bear fruit. Even after the outbreak of hostilities, India persis
ted in its 
efforts to mobilise the Non-Aligned Movement in seeking a peaceful resolution t
o 
the crisis. In that context, the then External Affairs Minister visited Belgrad
e and 
Tehran in January 1991. India took part in a 16-nation Non-Aligned Movement 
meeting in Belgrade (11 to 13 February 1991) held at the level of Foreign 
Ministers. As a follow up of that meeting, a small group of NAM Foreign 
Ministers were to visit Baghdad, Washington, Brussels, Riyadh and Taif. <br><br>
 
  The Deputy Minister for External Affairs, Shri Digvijay Singh, visited Algeri
a, 
France, Zimbabwe and the UK between 23 January and 1 February for consulta- 
tions in the context of the Gulf crisis. 
 
  As the Gulf war proceeded and it became clear that the aerial bombing was 
not confined to military targets, in a statement issued on 8 February 1991, Ind
ia 
urged that internationally accepted methods of warfare be scrupulously adhered 
to 
and that every possible precaution should be taken to protect the civilian 
population against the devastation and risks of the military operations. The 
statement pointed out that even those countries which were taking part in the 

military operations had stated that the objective was to liberate Kuwait and no
t to 
subdue Iraq or to dismantle its technological and physical infrastructure or to
 
cripple its social and economic life. India also urged the Security Council to 

meet urgently to review the situation and to keep meeting on a regular basis fo
r 
periodic review.<br><br> 
 
  India was also concerned over the possible use of nuclear and chemical 
weapons in the Gulf war and urged all concerned to eschew the use of such 
weapons. 
 
                              <br>pg32<br> 
 
  There were 172,000 Indian nationals in Kuwait and another 9000 in Iraq 
when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Within a space of two months and a half, over 
150,000 Indian nationals were evacuated through air, land and sea from Kuwait 

and Iraq. The bulk of them were airlifted from Amman where they reached 
through the land route from Kuwait and Baghdad. On receiving reports of 
shortages of food in Kuwait and Iraq, India sent 9775 tonnes of essential food 

supplies and medicines with the approval of the UN Sanctions Committee through 

Indian ship M.V. Vishva Siddhi, which reached the Iraqi port of Um Qasr on 26 

September 1990. Four thousand seven hundred seventy three tonnes of these 
food items were distributed among Indian nationals and others and the rest were
 
off-loaded and stored in Iraq and Kuwait on the advice of the UN Sanctions 
Committee for distribution among nationals of other countries. 
 
  The Gulf crisis has placed additional burden on India's economy, in terms of 

lost export opportunities, sudden stop in remittances, cost of repatriation and
 
rehabilitation, higher prices of oil and the need to find alternative sources t
o offset 
interruption in supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. India will have an additional 
foreign exchange burden during the year itself to the tune of US $ 4 billion di
rectly 
due to these developments. <br><br>
 
  In the wake of the Gulf crisis, a Special Coordination Unit (SCU) was set up 
in 
the Ministry of External Affairs on 13 August 1990, to coordinate work relating
 to 
the welfare and repatriation of thousands of Indian nationals stranded in Kuwai
t, to 
answer queries of the general public regarding the ongoing developments on a da
y 
to day basis in Kuwait and, to the extent possible, to ascertain welfare of 
individuals and relatives of those making the enquiries. The SCU maintained 
constant contact with Indian Mission in Kuwait through radio link. Arrangements
 
were also made for despatch of letters of the relatives to individuals in Kuwai
t/ 
Baghdad through couriers/diplomatic bags and subsequent distribution of these 

letters through the Indian associations there. with effect from 25 August 1990.
 
The same procedure was followed for the replies received from the individuals 

in Kuwait/Baghdad.

    <td>AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA) 
 
  <br>DURING the year under review, events in sub-Saharan Africa moved 
rapidly but generally in a positive direction. Following Dr Nelson Mandela's 
release, the South African Government dismantled certain aspects of the dis- 
criminatory system and entered into a welcome dialogue with the African Nationa
l 
Congress. However, the basic features of the apartheid system remain in place. 

The resolution of civil strife in Angola and Mozambique through dialogue, with 

the active encouragement of the USA and the USSR, advanced, with talks in Europ
e 
being held periodically, despite occasional setbacks. <br><br>
 
  Elsewhere in Africa, there was the delayed impact of democratisation in East 

Europe with reactions of single party systems in Africa varying from country to
 
country but with growing certitude that the continent was in transition towards
 
different degrees of political pluralism. This trend coincides with the liberat
ion 
of Namibia and impending changes in South Africa. <br><br>
 
  As the continent entered into a more advanced political phase, the economics 

of most of the countries came under greater pressure from paucity of foreign 
exchange, growing imbalances of payments, depressed prices. of principal com- 

modities and greater indebtedness. There was a growing realisation, in several 

African countries, that India was a source of low cost, appropriate technology.
 
Inhibiting factors against greater Indian cooperation at this crucial stage wer
e 
the continuing nonpayment of blocked Indian dues by a number of African 
countries as well as India's own foreign exchange crunch. Most African countrie
s 
stiff continued to press for Indian credit and favourable terms of trade. Howev
er, 
a number of significant break throughs were made by Indian public and private 

sector companies, while the provision of training in diverse fields continued a
pace. 
 
                             <br>pg34<br> 
 
  The year 1990 was also significant in that a number of joint Commission 
meetings took place, which had been postponed for many years. These included 
the joint Commissions between India and Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. 
 
  India's relations with the countries of sub-Saharan Africa continued to impro
ve 
further and diversify during the year. With the process of decolonisation 
virtually complete, emphasis in India's relations with Africa is shifting to ec
onomic 
and technical cooperation. Special attempts were made to tide over the 
difficulties created by the problem of blocked funds.<br><br> 
 
  India's relations with the countries of Southern Africa and the liberation 
movements fighting for a unitary, non-racist and democratic South Africa, remai
ned 
very close. Following the former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh's visit to 
Namibia, as the head of a high level multi-party delegation on the occasion of 
the 
independence of that country on Mar 19, 1990, India announced a Rs 20 crore

  The civil war in Liberia worsened in July and led to a mass exodus of people 

of Indian origin, who at the start of the trouble numbered nearly 10,000. 
However, about 600 were trapped in the city between the warring forces of 
Prince Johnson, Taylor and the entrenched President Samuel Doe. A Shipping 
Corporation of India vessel was diverted to the waters outside Monrovia. A 
special consular team was rushed to neighbouring Sierra Leone and the assistanc
e 
of the USA sought to evacuate the trapped Indians. Between 14 and 29 August, 
449 persons were lifted by US helicopters to Sierra Leone from where onward 
bookings were arranged by the Indian team. By the end of the year as a truce 
seemed possible in Liberia, the only Indians left were those remaining behind o
f 
their own volition and numbering about 50.<br><br>

  The Action For Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund 
was constituted by the 8th Summit of the Heads of State/Government of the 
Movement of Non-Aligned countries in Harare in September 1986 and its mandate 

was renewed by the 9th Summit of the NAM in Belgrade in 1989. It was the 
political expression of the Movement's support and assistance to the Frontline 

African States to enforce sanctions against South Africa and to cope with any 

retaliatory economic actions by the racist regime. The Fund was set up to 
strengthen the economic and financial capability of the Frontline States to fig
ht the 
Apartheid regime of Pretoria and to support the liberation movements in South 

Africa and Namibia in their unrelenting struggle against racist and colonialist
 
oppression. It received considerable support not only from the members of the 

Non-Aligned Movement but also from non-member countries and. international 
organizations like United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Chil- 

dren's Fund, International Fund for Agricultural Developments (IFAD) and the 
Commonwealth Secretariat. 
 <br>pg39 <br>
 
  In terms of monetary support, the Fund has received pledges in cash and kind 

including project assistances equivalent to US $ 440 million from 58 countries 
an 
over the world. Contributions to the Fund were also received from individuals a
s 
well as organizations in India. A society called AFRICA (Public Contributions: 

India) Fund was set up to manage these contributions in Indian rupees. The 
society has received so far contributions totalling Rs 2.56 crores. A project f
or 
supplying consumer durables of urgent need to the ANC will be financed partly 

from the contributions by the Indian public. <br><br>
 
  At the commencement of the Fund, India had announced a contribution of 
Rs. 50 crores. Since this announcement in January 1987, a large number of proje
cts 
have been financed from this contribution in the Frontline countries. Recent 
such projects include supply of agricultural implements to Botswana, TATA 
vehicles to Zimbabwe, software for Mozambican Railway Protection Force and 
consumer durables to Mozambique, small scale industries to Botswana, supply of 

jeeps to the Tanzanian and the Zambian News Agencies and emergency supply of 
medicines to Zambia. The implementation of several other projects is underway 

with implementing agencies such as STC, PEC, MECON, HSCC and NSIC. 
 
  Contributions from other member and non-member countries of the Non- 
Aligned Movement have been in the form of projects, scholarships or cash 
assistance. The sixth Senior Officials Meeting held in May 1990 in Lusaka 
decided to distribute a part of the cash assistance pledged by the donors. 
Accordingly, US $ 70,000 were given to each Frontline state apart from US $ 
800,000 each to Namibia and the ANC and US $ 200,000 to the PAC. The film on 
the AFRICA Fund was revised and updated for publicity to elicit contributions t
o 
the Fund. <br><br>
 
  India is the Chairman of the AFRICA Fund Committee. The Special Envoy of 
the Prime Minister for Africa (SEPM), Shri J R Hiremath, chaired the seventh 
Meeting of Senior Officials which took place in Windhoek, Namibia from 11 to 14
 
December 1990. This was a crucial meeting as it was held after a series of 
eventful developments in Southern Africa such as the release of Dr Nelson 
Mandela, the independence of Namibia, the lifting of the ban on the ANC and the
 
PAC, and President De Klerk's announcement on the process of dismantling of 
apartheid. The seventh Meeting of Senior Officials of the Fund took note of the
se 
developments but concluded that further intensification of the activities of th
e 
Fund was necessary tiff the irreversible process for dismantling of apartheid s
ets in. 
 
                           <br>pg40 <br>
 
  Shri J R Hiremath held useful discussions with the President of Namibia and 

other government dignitaries during his visit to Windhoek. A Memorandum of 
Understanding was signed for the implementation of four Indian aided projects v
iz, 
a Vocational Training Centre, Technical Assistance in Water Resources Manage- 

ment, Technical Assistance in the Education Sector and Supply of Mobile Clinics
 
together with medicines, under the AFRICA Fund. The seventh meeting also 
provided the opportunity to firm up a number of projects under India's 
contribution to the AFRICA Fund in Mozambique, Zimbabwe etc. 
 
  At present, more than 90% of the contributions pledged to the Fund have 
been earmarked and committed against identified projects and programmes. 
More than 60% of the committed fund has already been utilised and benefits 
have reached the recipients.

  INDO-Soviet relations continued to be close, friendly and cordial. The visit 

of the former Prime Minister, Shri V P Singh to the USSR in July 1990 provided 

an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of Indo-Soviet relations and
 
to give an impetus for their further development to mutual benefit. It was 
decided to extend the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation 

and to befittingly celebrate in 1991 the 20th anniversary of the signing of thi
s 
important document. The joint documents signed during the visit reaffirmed the 

desire of both countries to further develop the multi-faceted bilateral relatio
ns in 
various fields. Other high level exchanges during the year were the visit of th
e 
Chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet, Mr A I Lukyanov, who led a Soviet 
Parliamentary delegation to India from 4 to Apr 08, 1990; the then External Aff
airs 
Minister, Shri I K Gujral's visit to the Soviet Union in August for consultatio
ns with 
the Soviet side on the Gulf crisis; the visits of the then Ministers for Commer
ce 
and Energy to the Soviet Union; and the visit of the Soviet Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Mr Igor Rogacher for regular bilateral consultations. He conveyed Sov
iet 
Union's firm commitment to further strengthening the multi-faceted bilateral 
cooperation. <br><br>
 
  While Indo-Soviet economic cooperation continued to develop well during 
the first half of the year, some difficulties have of late appeared in India's 
bilateral 
trade and economic relations with the Soviet Union because of the disruptions i
n 
the Soviet economy arising out of internal difficulties in that country. Trade 
in 
1990 is expected to fall slightly short of the target. Nevertheless, the Indo-S
oviet 
Trade Plan for 1991 signed in November 1990 envisages an increase in trade 
 
                             <br> pg42 
 <br>
turnover to Rs 9411 crores. The need for modifications and innovations in 
economic bilateral cooperation mechanism was recognised at a working meeting 
of the Indo-Soviet joint Commission for Economic, Scientific and Technical 
Cooperation in Moscow in July 1990. Cooperation in the fields of banking, 
insurance, industrial management and other services is also envisaged. Academi-
 
cian Marchuk, the President of the USSR Academy of Sciences, visited India to t
ake 
part in the third session of the joint Council of the Integrated Long Term 
Agreement in the field of science and technology. 
 
  In keeping with the tradition of helping each other in times of need, India 

extended urgently needed relief assistance to the USSR consisting of 1 million 

tonnes of wheat on loan basis, and a gift of 20,000 tonnes of rice, as well as 

medicines, medical supplies, processed foods and other items.<br><br>

  The year under review saw consolidation of the processes of democratization, 

political pluralism and economic liberalisation in the countries of Central and
 
Eastern Europe. In spite of the domestic preoccupations of these countries, and
 
a reorientation of their foreign policy priorities, the traditionally close bil
ateral ties 
between India and these countries were reaffirmed and renewed. <br><br>
 
  After a gap of many years, diplomatic relations with Albania were fully 
restored on 27 April 1990 with the accreditation of an Indian Ambassador to 
Tirana. 
 
  Relations between India and Bulgaria were marked by continuing warmth and 
friendship. The Cultural Exchange Programme for 1990 to 1992 with Bulgaria 
was signed in Sofia in March 1990. During the year there was an active 
exchange of cultural troupes. Immediate humanitarian food assistance provided 

by India to the stranded Bulgarian nationals in Iraq was appreciated. Chairman 
of 
Bulgarian National Assembly visited India in January 1991 and called on the Vic
e 
President and the Speaker of Lok Sabha.<br><br> 
 
  The Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mr Jiri 
Dienstbier paid an official visit to India from 30 October to 2 November 1990. 

This was the first high level exchange with the new leadership in Czechos- 
 
                              <br>pg43<br> 
 
lovakia, which constituted an important step in strengthening cooperative and 

friendly relations between India and Czechoslovakia. An Agreement, signed in 
Prague on 17 January 1991, extended the bilateral Rupee Trade and Payments 
arrangements for a period of two years, ie, upto December 1992. 
 
  A Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shri Rabi Ray
 
visited Hungary in June 1990, during the very first session of the newly electe
d 
multi-party Parliament. These and other contacts at the political level testifi
ed to 
the desire of both countries to further nurture the bonds of traditional friend
ship 
between the two countries. Trade prospects continued to be good, while new 
opportunities and areas for economic cooperation were identified. <br><br>
 
  The steady momentum of cooperative interaction between India and Poland 
was maintained. India's friendly relations received a fresh impetus with the vi
sit 
of a Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shri Rabi Ra
y, to 
Poland in June 1990. Taking into account the changes in Poland, the two 
countries decided during the meeting of the Indo-Polish joint Commission in 
Warsaw in September 1990, headed on the Indian side by the then Energy 
Minister, Shri Arif Mohammed Khan, that trade with Poland would be conducted in
 
convertible currency from January 1991. Accordingly, the Polish Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations, Mr Marcin Swiecicki, visited India in November 1990
 
and signed a new Trade and Payments Agreement.<br><br> 
 
  The positive trends in Indo-Romanian relations evident since December 1989 
changes in Romania consolidated with increased bilateral contacts and exchanges
. 
President R Venkataraman had a cordial and friendly meeting with President Ion 

Iliescu of Romania in Tokyo on 12 November 1990. Cultural exchanges have 
been revitalised, with increased exchanges of cultural troupes and scholars. A 

bilateral Air Services Commercial Agreement was initialled in December 1990. 
President Iliescu paid a transit visit to Delhi on 16 January 1991. He met Prim
e 
Minister Chandra Shekhar and discussed bilateral and multilateral matters of 
mutual interest. The bilateral Rupee Trade and Payments Agreement was extended 

upto June 1991 through an exchange of letters on 7 January 1991 pending formal 

renewal of the Agreement. <br><br>

  During the year under review, the European continent has undergone a major 
transformation marking a turning point in its history. The Cold War has given 

way to detente and the Charter of Paris signed by the 34 CSCE (Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe) countries has been hailed as the "magna 
carta" of new Europe. This was preceded by an agreement on the reduction of 
conventional weapons signed between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries which 
the participants called "a new era of democracy, peace and unity in Europe." 
India which has a wide network of political, economic, commercial, scientific, 

technological and cultural contacts with the countries in this region has welco
med 
the process of reduction of tensions and hopes this would lead to peaceful and 

stable world order which will yield concrete benefits all over the globe. 
An important part of India's bilateral relations as well as assistance through 

multilateral organizations is channelled through India's contacts and negotiati
ons 
with major countries in Europe. The year under review has seen considerable 
progress through exchanges of several high level visits both incoming and 
outgoing, 
 
  President R Venkataraman visited the UK, Portugal and Malta in March 
and April 1990. The visit to the UK was the first by an Indian President 
after a gap of 14 years. It was marked by great warmth and goodwill, and useful
 
high level discussions between the President and Queen Elizabeth, the former 
Prime Minister Thatcher, Deputy Prime Minister Howe and other leaders. 
 
  The process of dialogue with the UK on bilateral cooperation and on 
strengthening measures to prevent terrorist activities directed against India 

showed, significant progress and discussions on cooperation in tracing, restrai
nt 
and confiscation of the proceeds and instruments of crime and terrorist funds a
re 
being pursued.<br>                                                                
         
 
                              pg45 <br> 
 
  The President's State visit to Portugal was highly successful. It has led to 

strengthening of relations between the two countries in several fields. During 

the visit, Portugal also announced her decision in principle to return the gold
 
ornaments which had been shifted to Portugal after the liberation of Goa in 196
1. 
The settlement of this problem has served to remove a major hurdle in 
improving India's bilateral ties with Portugal which are now characterised by 

warmth and friendliness. <br><br>
 
  The visit of the President to Malta--the first such visit by an Indian Presid
ent 
to that country--provided an impetus for closer cooperation in areas of mutual 

interest. A decision to set up a resident mission in Malta was announced and ha
s 
since been implemented. An Indian public sector company BHEL has also won a 
major contract for a power project in that country. 
 
  Apart from the visits of the President, the then Minister for External Affair
s, 
Shri I K Gujral, visited the Netherlands and Italy (September 1990), Belgium 
(March 1990) and Germany (June 1990). The then Minister of State for External 

Affairs visited Ireland and Cyprus. Close contacts with Parliamentarians of 
several West European countries were also maintained. Of particular note were 

the visits of the Lok Sabha Speaker and Indian Parliamentary delegations to the
 UK, 
Belgium and Strasbourg in response to invitations from the British and European
 
Parliaments. <br><br>
 
  One of the landmarks of the year 1990 was the unification of the two 
Germanys on 3 October. India has warmly welcomed this event as a reflection 
of the will of the people of Germany and has expressed the hope that this would
 
lead to reduction of tensions, and that United Germany will further contribute 
to 
peace and stability in the world. Germany retains its position as the largest 

foreign investor and trading partner of India in the EEC. The then External 
Affairs Minister's visit to Bonn on the eve of German unification was a valuabl
e and 
well timed exercise. Bilateral cooperation is expected to be further expanded 

and strengthened in the coming year. 
 <br><br>
  The annual Indo-EEC TROIKA meeting was held in Brussels in March 1990. 
This political dialogue to which India attaches great importance was timely and
 
useful. Apart from matters of mutual interest, it was also decided to set up a 
new 
Business Forum comprising leading entrepreneurs and officials from India and th
e 
Community. The Community's progress towards greater European integration 
 
                              pg46 
 <br><br>
and the establishment of a single market in 1992 poses challenges and oppor- 
tunities for India and it is hoped that through various institutional linkages,
 India 
would be able to take advantage of the single market for promoting her exports 

and economic cooperation with the EEC. The Indo-EEC joint Commission 
meeting held in May 1990 was led by the then Commerce Minister, Shri Arun 
Nehru. Tourism and Fisheries were identified as new areas for cooperation. A 
Memorandum of Understanding was signed between India and EEC in October 
1990 for cooperation in the fields of electronics and telecommunications. 
Preparations are going on smoothly in sectors such as standards, quality contro
l 
etc as part of India's efforts for exploiting future single market of this regi
on. 
 
  India's relations with West Europe during the year have been marked with 
cordiality and mutual appreciation of each other's needs and potentialities. 
India's concerns, both internal and external, have been appreciated. India is 

looking forward to a period of continued expansion of her relations in a number
 of 
fields for common benefit.

  THE year 1990 witnessed the continuing consolidation of Indo-US 
relations. There was a great degree of understanding, both on bilateral and 
international issues.<br><br> 
 
  A large number of prominent US Senators and Congressmen visited India early 

during the year. Congressman Stephen Solarz, Chairman of the House Asian and 
Pacific Affairs Sub Committee on Foreign Relations, Senators Arlen Spector and 

Richard Shelby, and Under Secretary for Defence, Dr Henry Rowen were the 
important visitors. Exchange of views with the Government of India on a wide 
range of issues helped in conveying India's view to the US Congress and 
Administration. 
 
  The Principal Secretary to the former Prime Minister, Shri B G Deshmukh 
headed a delegation to the USA to present India's viewpoint at Washington on a 

number of issues. The Special Envoy of the US President and Deputy National 
Security Advisor Robert Gates, US Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly, Spec
ial 
Assistant to the President on National Security, and Senior Director for the Ne
ar 
Eastern and South Asia Bureau (NESA) Richard Haass visited India to exchange 
views on the Indo-Pak situation. US Congressman Stephen Solarz re-visited India
 
for the same purpose and Senator Alan Cranston was another important visitor 
who came to discuss the Indo-Pak situation. <br><br>
 
  The then External Affairs Minister, Shri I K Gujral met his counterpart, 
Secretary of State James Baker on several occasions, including the Special 
 
                             <br>pg48<br> 
 
Session of the United Nations General Assembly. There were other high 
level visits undertaken by the then Ministers for Railways and for Labour and 

Welfare. 
 
  As a follow up of ongoing Foreign Secretary level bilateral discussions, the 

Foreign Secretary visited Washington and discussed a wide range of bilateral 
and international issues. The situation in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir 
figured prominently in these discussions especially in the context of Pakistan'
s 
role in aggravating the situation. <br><br>
 
  Governor Celeste of Ohio also visited India at the invitation extended to 
him by Punjab, Haryana and Delhi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
 
  The year also saw the appointment of a new Indian Ambassador to the 
United States, Dr Abid Hussain. 
 
  The then Minister for External Affairs, Shri V C Shukla visited New York 
from 3 to 15 December to attend the closing Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly (UNGA). 
 
  The second round of the jointly sponsored IDSA-INSS Symposium on 
defence and strategic issues was held in Pune in December 1990. There was 
a wide ranging discussion on bilateral and multilateral issues by the particip-
 
ants. <br><br>
 
  At the official level, meetings of the various Subgroups of the Indo-US 
Joint Commission were held. These included the Sub Commission on Educa- 
tion and Culture, Economic and Commercial Sub Commission and the Sub 
Commission on Agriculture. The Indo-US joint Business Conference also held 
its annual meeting in Washington. 
 
  The USA remained India's largest trading partner and accounted for 18.5% 
of Indian exports and about 11.5% of her imports. On the other hand, India 
accounted for a mere 0.7% of US total imports and 0.8% of US total exports 
in 1989. Right from the year 1982, India has enjoyed a positive balance of 
trade with the USA and the trade surplus reached a level of US $ 906 million 
in 1989. Early indications of Indo-US trade figures for the year 1990 showed 
 
                             <br>pg49<br> 
 
a stabilisation of the two way turnover. The star performers of Indian exports 
over 
the years were diamonds, textiles, engineering products, carpets and floor 
coverings, leather and leather manufactures and chemicals. 
 
  The USA is the largest investment partner of India and accounts for about 
1/5th of the joint ventures approved by Government of India and 75% of these 
are in the manufacturing sector.<br><br> 
 
  However, there were several problems which resulted in an adverse impact 
on Indian exports to the USA. Prominent among them are anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties by the USA and the stringent health and sanitary regulati
ons 
of FDA which are affecting India's exports of Marine products, basmati rice, 
brassware etc. 
 
  The US Government had cited India's policies on foreign investment insurance 

as barriers to trade but after subsequent negotiations, the US decided not to 

impose any sanction against India under the 301 legislation and postponed their
 
decision till after December 1990, when the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade
 
Talks was scheduled to be completed. The US Government, under Special 301, 
also claimed that India's protection of Intellectual Property Rights was inadeq
uate. 
The US Government indicated that Indian action and policies would continue to 

be watched and this matter may be reviewed after the Uruguay Round of Talks in 

December 1990. India however refused to negotiate under the threat of 
retaliation. 
 <br><br>
  The Annual Review talks on the Indo-US Memorandum of Understanding were 
held in Washington. This led to the further streamlining of the implementation 

procedures, providing a fillip to the expanding area of high technology trade. 

 
  Discussions continued on the sale of a second Super Computer to India. 
Modalities of enforcement of the Distribution licence Review System were 
discussed. A joint team of US Department of Commerce experts and Govern- 
ment of India officials conducted a security review in selected Indian Distribu
tion 
licence holding companies. 
 <br><br>
  The joint Working Group on Narcotics was set up and a cooperation 
agreement between India and the USA in this field was signed. 
 
                             <br>pg50<br> 
 
  With the all-round improvement in bilateral ties, a limited cooperation in th
e 
field of defence has commenced. At present, this is mainly focussed on the 
transfer of sophisticated technology and equipment for the Light Combat Air- 
craft Project. In recent years, the US Government has been earmarking small 
quantities of aid under its International Military Education and Training (IMET
) 
programme. US $ 299,000 was requested by US State Department from 
Congress Appropriations in the financial year 1990. These funds are utilised 
to finance visits and exchanges between Indian and US armed forces per- 
sonnel. <br><br>
 
  Lt General Claude M Kicklighter, Commanding General, US Army, Western 
Command visited India at the invitation of the Indian Chief of Army Staff. 
The Indian Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral J G Nadkarni visited US Naval 
Establishments in the USA, including the CINCPAC Headquarters in Hawaii in 
October 1990. United States Pacific Command, Commander-in-Chief Admiral 
Huntington Hardisty visited India to participate in a Indo-US Conference jointl
y 
organized by the Delhi based Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA) 

and the Washington based Institute for National Strategic Studies at Kharag- 
vasla, Pune from 11 to Dec 13, 1990. 
 <br><br>
  The Gulf crisis brought a new set of problems including the repatriation 
of 150,000 Indian workers to India. The then External Affairs Minister flew 
to Washington to meet Secretary of State James Baker and apprise him of this 
human aspect of the Gulf crisis. The US has expressed sympathy and under- 
standing in assessing the impact of the Gulf crisis on Indian economy. 
 
  During the year under review, bilateral relations between India and 
Canada remained cordial. <br><br>
 
  Two Canadian Ministers visited India during 1990. Madame Monique 
Landry, Minister for External Relations and International Development, in her 

capacity as Governor ad-interim came to attend the Asian Development Bank 
meeting held in New Delhi. Madame Barbara McDougall, Canada's Minister 
for Employment and Immigration also paid a visit. 
 
  Shri Ajit Singh, the then Industry Minister visited Canada to deliver the 
keynote address at a conference organized by the Shastri Indo-Canadian Insti- 

tute in Montreal and Concordia University. 
 
                             <br>pg51<br> 
 
  During the year, Shri G N Mehra took up his assignment as the new Indian 
High Commissioner to Canada. 
 
  Canada evinced interest in cooperating with India in the fields of power, 
defence, space, telecommunications, education and culture. In some fields, the 

preliminary formalities towards conclusion of a bilateral agreement were com- 

pleted during the year. <br><br>
 
  Canada has also shown interest in the Yamuna Nagar Thermal Power Project 
and Chamera-II Project. These projects are being considered by the Indian 
Government appropriately. 
 
  India has had an adverse balance of trade (-189.80 Rs crores) with Canada. 
Total exports from India were of the value of 264.09 crores of rupees, and 
imports of 453.89 crores; of rupees, for 1989-90. Principal items of exports fr
om 
India are RMG Cotton including accessories, leather and manufactured handmade 

carpets, gems and jewellery, cotton yam fabric made-ups, RMG manmade fibres, 
handicrafts etc. Principal items of import from Canada are sulphur and unroaste
d 
iron parts, fertilisers, manufactured machinery, pulp and waste paper, other cr
ude 
minerals, newsprint, metalliferous; ores and metal scraps, transport equipment 
etc. 
 <br><br>
  There are no special problems between the two countries in regard to trade 
except that import of certain items like footwear and textiles into Canada are 

subject to quota restrictions.

  During the year under review, India has made sustained efforts to consolidate
 
and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations with Latin American nations
 by 
initiating high level contacts. India has also attempted to register its presen
ce as 
a reliable trading partner and a possible source of equipment and technology. 

 
  India was represented at the inaugurations of (i) the Presidents of Chile and
 
Brazil in March 1990 by the then Minister for Surface Transport, (ii) the 
President of Nicaragua in April 1990 by the then Minister for Labour and Welfar
e, 
and (iii) the Presidents of Peru and Colombia in July/August 1990 by the then 

Minister of State for External Affairs. The inauguration ceremonies provided 
 
                             <br>pg52<br> 
 
occasions for India's Ministers to confer individually with Presidents, Vice 
Presidents and other leaders from the region and convey India's willingness to 

intensify bilateral relations. Bilateral consultations in areas of mutual inter
est 
were held during the then Commerce Minister's visit to Brazil (July 1990). <br><br>
 
  The then Minister of State for External Affairs represented India at the 
presentation of the Final Report of the South Commission at Caracas (August 
1990). The then Minister for Information and Broadcasting and Parliamentary 
Affairs attended the third Conference of Information Ministers of Non-aligned 

countries in Havana (September 1990). He also called on President Castro. 
 
  Indian army officers participated in the United Nations Observer Group in 
Central America (ONUCA). 
 
  Visits by Parliamentary delegations were encouraged. A Parliamentary 
delegation led by the Lok Sabha Speaker paid a goodwill visit to Colombia in 
October 1990 before attending the IPU Conference in Uruguay. A ten member 
Parliamentary delegation from Argentina visited India from 19 to 27 November 
1990. 
 
  In consultation with the Ministry of Commerce and related agencies, 
concerted efforts were made to boost trade with the region, which absorbs less 

than one per cent of India's exports and accounts for 2.4 per cent of India's 

imports.<br><br> 
 
  The first meeting of the Indo-Cuban joint Commission was held at the Foreign 

Ministers level in New Delhi in April 1990. Efforts were made to activate the 

Indo-Mexican joint Commission and the joint Committee for Trade with Argentina.
 
 
  Agreements for cooperation in the field of Science and Technology are being 

finalised with some countries in the region. 
 <br><br>
  In an effort to strengthen relations with countries in the region as a whole,
 
India has applied for Permanent Observer Status at the Organization of American
 
States. This would provide an additional forum for interaction with the countri
es 
of the region, 17 of whom are members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The 
 
                              <br>pg53<br> 
 
process of regular consultations with the Rio Group of Latin American countries
 
was initiated in New York (2 October 1990) where the then External Affairs 
Minister, Shri I K Gujral met his counterparts from Colombia and Venezuela. 
 
  The distinguished visitors from the region included the Minister for Planning
 
and Reconstruction (March 1990) and the Minister for Industry, Enterprise and 

Tourism (July 1990) of Trinidad &amp; Tobago; the Foreign Minister of Cuba (April 

1990); the wife of the President of Suriname (May/June 1990); and the Chairman 

of the Argentine Atomic Energy Commission (December 1990). <br><br>
 
  India's gift to Nicaragua consisting of jeeps, three wheelers, bicycles, medi
cal 
equipment, raw jute etc was appreciated by the Government of that country. 
India also provided to Trinidad &amp; Tobago emergency medical relief and "Jaipur 

Feet." 
 
  In Suriname, the democratically elected Government of President Ramasewak 
Shanker was overthrown by the military leader Lt Col Bouterse in a bloodless 
coup. He subsequently installed a provisional government and announced that 
fresh elections would be held in May 1991. The then External Affairs Minister 

made a statement in the Lok Sabha on 28 December 1990 giving the broad facts 
and expressing the hope that democracy would be restored soon in that country.

    <td>UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES<br> 
 
  1990 was a watershed year for the United Nations. Dramatic changes-- 
political, social and economic--in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, policy 
reorientations in many countries, growing superpower collaboration, the emerg- 

ence of a unified Germany, European integration, Japan's uninterrupted economic
 
growth and the Gulf crisis and its aftermath--all these were reflected in varyi
ng 
degrees within the UN and they made an impact upon its functioning. 
 
  Besides political issues such as the Gulf crisis, the situation in the Middle
 East 
(West Asia) and Cambodia, UN centre-stage was held by subjects such as drug 
abuse control, environmental protection and human rights. <br><br>
 
  India's traditional attachment to the UN ideas continued to be reflected in i
ts 
active role on all important issues coming up before the world body. The 
reputation and influence which India enjoys in the world body can be measured 

by the fact that she has been elected to the Security Council for the sixth tim
e for 
a two year term (1991 and 1992). India took its seat in the Security Council wi
th 
effect from Jan 01, 1991. The current term of India has begun at a critical tim
e 
in the history of the United Nations. India's role in the Council will be guide
d 
by its commitment to the UN Charter which has entrusted the primary 
responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security to the Secur
ity 
Council. In the non-aligned forum as well, India continued to exercise decisive
 
influence, particularly at a time when the Non-Aligned Movement as a whole, 
disconcerted by the attack by one of its members (Iraq) on another (Kuwait) 
needed to define its role in the light of radical changes in international rela
tions. 
 
                             <br>pg55<br>
 
  India successfully countered attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue 

made by Pakistan at various multilateral fora.</td></tr>

  Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the Gulf crisis 
dominated the United Nations. The Security Council remained continuously 
seized of the matter, holding frequent and often urgent meetings. India's respo
nse 
to the developments in the Gulf was consistent with her principled position 
against the use of force, and in favour of a peaceful negotiated settlement of 

disputes between the parties concerned. India called for unconditional with- 
drawal by Iraq from Kuwait and the restoration of the sovereignty and independ-
 
ence of the latter. India remained in step with the international community in 

implementing the Security Council resolutions. 
 <br><br>
  The Gulf crisis has had severe adverse consequences for India's economy and 

for the Indian community in Iraq and Kuwait. When the Indian community there 
was faced with food shortages, the matter was pursued with promptness and 
effectiveness in the United Nations and permission secured to send a shipload o
f 
foodstuffs from India to Iraq. In accordance with the terms of the UN decision,
 
the Indian Embassy in Baghdad with the help of the Indian Red Cross Society and
 
the organizations of Indian community there, undertook the distribution of the 

foodstuffs, not only to the Indian community but also to several other third 
country nationals, including Filipinos, Sri Lankans, Vietnamese and Palestinian
s. 
India's efficient handling of this matter and her willingness to share food wit
h 
other foreign nationals were widely appreciated in the UN. Later, prompt 
permission of the Security Council was secured for the flights of the Indian Ai
r 
Force aircraft between Bombay and Baghdad for the evacuation of the Indian 
community. 
 <br><br>
  The adverse effects of the developments in the Gulf and economic sanctions 
against Iraq on India's economy were brought to the attention of the United 
Nations under Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations, with request for
 
urgent consultations with the Security Council in order to seek a solution of t
hese 
problems. The Security Council recognised the need to assist India in coping 
with its special economic problems and appealed to all States, UN agencies, 
financial institutions etc to provide immediate assistance. 
 
                              <br>pg56<br> 
 
  Even as the deadline set by Security Council Resolution 678 for withdrawal by
 
Iraq from Kuwait (15 January 1991) was being crossed and outbreak of hostilitie
s 
appeared imminent, Prime Minister addressed an urgent communication to 
Presidents of the United States, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (the current 

Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement) emphasizing the imperative need to 
prevent the outbreak of hostilities. The Indian initiative was based on simulta
ne- 
ous Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and suspension of hostilities; during the peri
od 
of suspension, it should be possible to agree upon "the modalities" of resolvin
g the 
issues such as provision of a guarantee to Iraq of non-aggression, Iraq-Kuwait 

differences and the Palestine question. 
 <br><br>
  The question of Palestine remained a major issue before the Security Council 

and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at its 45th Session. several developments, 

including use of force by the Israeli authorities against the civilian Palestin
ian 
population in the Occupied Territories, were cause of concern to the internatio
nal 
community. In this context, India reiterated its steadfast support for the caus
e of 
Palestine. <br><br>
 
  The five Permanent Members of the Security Council undertook an initiative 
to formulate a framework for an agreement for the settlement of Cambodia., 
They held broad consultations with concerned parties and interested States, 
including India. India also attended, in its capacity as a co-Chairman of the F
irst 
Committee of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia (PICC), a meeting 

in Jakarta in November convened to initiate the elaboration of the framework 
agreement into a comprehensive draft agreement for subsequent adoption by the 

resumed PICC and eventually by the United Nations. India also continued a 
process of consultations with several parties and States, aimed at facilitating
 an 
early settlement of Cambodia on the basis of full respect for its sovereignty, 
the 
will of the Cambodian people, the non-return of the genocidal policies and 
practices of the past and the maintenance of its non-aligned status. 
 
  The General Assembly again adopted a resolution on Afghanistan by consen- 
sus. India welcomed the spirit of compromise and maintained its support to find
 
a political solution to the problem of Afghanistan through full implementation 
of 
the Geneva Agreements. India also held consultations with the parties con- 
cerned, as well as with the UN Secretary General, in connection with the ongoin
g 
peace efforts. 
 
                              <br>pg57<br> 
 
  India continued to support the 1971 Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a 
Zone of Peace and the early convening of a Conference for the implementation of
 
the Declaration. India participated constructively in the meetings of the Ad Ho
c 
Committee on the Indian Ocean working to attain these objectives. India 
continued to attach importance to the holding of such a Conference with the 
participation of all the major maritime users and major powers with military 
presence in the Indian Ocean. 
 <br><br>
  As in the past, negotiations between Treaty parties and non-Treaty members 
failed to produce a consensus text for draft resolution on Antarctica. Consiste
nt 
with its anti-apartheid policy, India voted in favour of a draft resolution cal
ling for 
the exclusion of South Africa from all the meetings of the Treaty parties. 
 
  India remains committed to broaden and universalise the Antarctic Treaty. 
it supports all proposals relating to the protection of the fragile Antarctic 

environment and related ecosystems and favours bringing the results of scientif
ic 
research in Antarctica increasingly to the attention of developing countries fo
r 
their benefit. <br><br>
 
  During the discussion on the Law of the Sea in the General Assembly Session, 

India supported the efforts of the signatories to the Convention on the Law of 
the 
Sea to explore possibilities to secure universal participation in the Conventio
n. 
India also opposed any undermining of the universal character of the Convention
. 
 
  India maintained her traditional support, in the UN and other international 

fora, for efforts to resolve the long outstanding problem of Cyprus on the basi
s of 
the latter's sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and to promote peacef
ul 
reunification of Korea. India welcomed the process of a peaceful settlement 
between Iran and Iraq and the peace process in Central America including the 
holding of elections in Nicaragua under the UN supervision. India responded 
positively to a UN request and contributed military observers in the UN peace 

keeping forces in Central America (ONUCA), besides maintaining her participatio
n 
in other UN peace keeping operations in Iran and Iraq (UNIIMOG) and in Angola 

(UNAVEM).

  During the year under review, India played an active role in the three main 

multilateral disarmament fora, viz, the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in 
Geneva, the UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC) and the First Committee of the 
UN General Assembly. 
 
  The Indian approach to disarmament is best reflected in the 'Action Plan for 
a 
Nuclear Weapon-free and Non-violent World Order' that was tabled at the Third 

Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament. India 
continued to emphasize the objective of eliminating nuclear weapons within a 
time bound framework and a movement away from the doctrine of nuclear 
deterrence. <br><br>
 
  A ban on nuclear weapon tests would be the most crucial step towards the 
above mentioned goal. India, therefore, highlighted the urgent need for 
commencing negotiations for a treaty to ban Nuclear Weapon Tests consistent 
with the preamble of the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Hoping to work toward
s 
this goal, India showed adequate flexibility to accept the establishment by the
 CD 
of an ad hoc Committee on a nuclear test ban. India was among the main 
supporters of the Partial Test Ban Treaty Amendment Conference held in New 
York from 7 to 18 January 1991. The aim of this Conference was to highlight 
the need for urgent action for a treaty on a nuclear weapons test ban. Indian 

experts took part in the work of the ad hoc Group of Scientific Experts towards
 
the elaboration of a global seismic monitoring system for a Comprehensive Test 

Ban Treaty. <br><br>
 
  In the negotiations on a global convention on Chemical Weapons, India 
worked for a comprehensive convention which would rule out discriminatory and 

short term measures. India was also represented in the meeting with the 
chemical industry held in June 1990 at Geneva in the context of the chemical 
weapons negotiations. 
 
  At the 45th Session of the UN General Assembly, India introduced two 
resolutions dealing with disarmament. The first, entitled "Scientific and Tech-
 
nological Developments and their Impact on International Security" was in keepi
ng 
with India's initiative in 1988 for ending the qualitative arms race. As a firs
t step 
 
                              <br>pg59<br> 
 
in that direction, India suggested monitoring of Scientific and Technological 

developments by a panel of eminent experts under the UN auspices. The Indian 
resolution requested the Secretary General to submit a framework for technologi
- 
cal assessment at the 47th Session of the UN General Assembly, with a view to 

ensuring that scientific and technological developments are used solely for 
peaceful purposes and for the common good of mankind. The Resolution gained 
widespread support with 133 countries voting in its favour. 
 <br><br>
  The second resolution, entitled "Convention on the Prohibition of the use of 

Nuclear Weapons," focussed on the threat which nuclear war poses to the life on
 
the planet and the urgent task of preventing such a war. The resolution contain
s a 
draft convention which could form the basis for an agreement. It received wide 

support with 125 countries voting in its favour. 
 
  A consensus document was submitted to the General Assembly during the 
year as the report of the UN Study on Verification undertaken in 1989 through a
 
joint initiative by India as part of the Six Nation appeal. The recommendations
 of 
this study focussed, inter-alia. on strengthening the ON role in the field of 

verification of disarmament agreements.<br>

 <tr class="evenRow"><td>                          The year under review saw significant developments in the economic field. 
A number of important meetings took place, nearly all of which concluded with 

consensus agreements. The major events were: the Special Session of the 
General Assembly on International Economic Cooperation; meetings of the 
Economic and Social Council; the UN Conference on the Least Developed 
Countries; the meetings of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole on the 
International Development Strategy (IDS) for the fourth United Nations Develop-
 
ment Decade; and the negotiations in the Second Committee of the 45th Session o

the General Assembly. Also, there were meetings at the UN of the Foreign 
Ministers of the Non-aligned countries and Grout) of 77 at the time of the 18th
 
Special Session and the 45th Session of the General Assembly. 
 <br><br>
  The 18th Special Session of the General Assembly on International Economic 
Cooperation, in particular on Revitalisation of Economic Growth and Development
 
of Developing Countries was held from April to May 1990 in New York. 
Developing countries felt that the Special Session could help to bring the focu
s 
 
                              <br>pg60<br> 
 
back on the central issues of poverty and development, in the context of the 
persisting stalemate in the North-South dialogue on economic issues. 
 
  The Declaration, which was adopted by consensus, states that the most 
important challenge for the 1990s is the revitalisation of economic growth and 

social development in the developing countries which calls for sustained growth
 of 
the world economy and favourable external conditions. <br><br>
 
  An Indian-delegation led by the then Minister for External Affairs, Shri I K 

Gujral and consisting of eminent economists and diplomats played a crucial role
 in 
the formulation of the framework for international cooperation adopted by the 

Special Session.<br><br> 
 
  At its Second Regular Session in July, Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) 

focussed on some key issues: the world economy and the broad question of 
resource transfers and financial flows; the implementation of the Declaration 

adopted at the 18th Special Session of the General Assembly; the highlight of t
he 
Session being the informal exchange of views on the evolution of East-West 
relations and its implications for the international monetary and financial sys
tems 
including resource transfers to developing countries, and its impact on interna
- 
tional trade.

  Shri C R Gharekhan, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, 

was elected President of ECOSOC for the year. The President as wen as the rest 

of the Indian delegation played an important role in facilitating an exchange o
f 
views on the needs of the developing countries in the new international situati
on. 
 
  The situation of the LDCs (Least Developed Countries) worsened despite the 
Substantial New Programme of Action adopted at the UN conference of LDCs held 

in 1981. A second conference was therefore convened in Paris in September 
1990 from which the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action (POA) for 
the LDCs for the 1990s emerged. The General Assembly endorsed both the 
Declaration and the POA. An Indian delegation led by India's Permanent 
Representative in Geneva attended the conference and helped in the formulation 

of the Paris Declaration. <br><br>
 
  The Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole for the preparation of 
the IDS (International Development Strategy) for the Fourth United Nations 
 
                              <br>pg61 <br>
 
Developments Decade, Mr Gamani Correa, prepared an excellent document for the 

Committee, which became the basis for the final consensus draft for submission 
to 
the 45th Session of the General Assembly. 
 <br><br>
  Among the ideas, concepts and recommendations contained in the IDS are: 
the interdependence of nations; the need to take steps to reverse the adverse 

trends of the 1980s; the importance of a surge in the pace of economic growth i
n 
developing countries; the importance of the responsiveness of the development 

process to social needs; the need for an improvement of the international 
economic system of money, finance and trade; the need for stability in the worl
d 
economy and for sound macro economic management nationally and internation- 
ally; and above all, the need for strengthening international development coope
ra- 
tion. It stresses the new opportunities for reversing the trends of the 1980s 

provided by the relaxation of international tensions and consequently, possibil
ities 
for application of larger resources to the fight against world poverty. This 
echoes the elements in the Declaration of the 18th Special Session which even 

speaks of exploring the feasibility of channelling some of the reductions in mi
litary 
expenditures, through financial mechanisms for development. <br><br>
 
  Among the important resolutions on economic matters that were adopted at 
the 45th Session of the Genera) Assembly were resolutions on the Report of 
ECOSOC which included, inter-alia, the US sponsored resolution on Entrepreneur-
 
ship, and a G-77 sponsored resolution initiated by India on the International 

Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade; Trade and Development; Food and 
Agricultural problems; Industrial Development of Developing Countries; and 
resolutions on the World Summit for Children, World Food Council and the 
United Nations Population Fund under Operational Activities. 
 
  The UNGA also adopted a resolution welcoming Uruguay's offer to host 
UNCTAD VIII at Punta dal Este from 21 September to 8 October 1991. <br><br>
 
  The Indian delegation to the Second Committee emphasized, in the various 
negotiations that took place, the importance of addressing the developmental 
needs of developing countries in matters relating to commerce, development and 

economic cooperation. It was ensured that the resolutions adopted on economic 

issues adequately reflected the views of the developing countries. 
 
  India participated actively in a large number of multilateral meetings on glo
bal 
environmental issues held during the year. To sensitize important developing 
 
                              pg62 
 <br><br>
countries to India's concerns and with a view to evolving a developing country 

perspective on a whole range of such issues, the Government of India organized 
a 
Conference of Twenty select developing countries on Global Environmental Issues
 
from 23 to 25 April 1990 at New Delhi. India successfully promoted a series of 

amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone layer 

and was able to ensure that its concerns were taken into account through the 
amendments to the protocol adopted by the Second Meeting of States parties to 

the Montreal Protocol held in London in end June 1990. India also actively 
participated in and projected its concerns and interests at the First Substanti
ve 
Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 1992 UN Conference on Environ- 
ment and Development, the meetings to prepare for negotiations on conventions 

on climate change and bio-diversity, and in the consideration of environmental 

issues by the 45th UN General Assembly.<br><br> 
 
  International preoccupations during 1990 centered around developments in 
the trading system, the consequences of the Gulf crisis and its impact on oil p
rices 
as well as the transition and restructuring of countries in East Europe. 
 
  As regards North-South cooperation, there were no major developments, 
despite a series of important conferences. In April 1990, at the Special Sessio
n of 
the UN General Assembly, the developing countries were able to obtain important
 
reaffirmation of the priority that the international community attaches to inte
rna- 
tional cooperation for development. India played an active role in the 
negotiations which resulted in a consensus declaration. While the declaration 

embodies important principles for cooperation in the future, it is in the natur
e of a 
conceptual document and does not embody specific commitments. This process 
was carried forward to some extent in the negotiations on the elaboration of an
 
International Development Strategy for the 1990s. <br><br>
 
  Although all these meetings after protracted negotiations, resulted in consen
- 
sus outcomes, it was found that the negotiating climate and the attitude to Nor
th- 
South negotiations has changed considerably. The industrialised countries have 

on most occasions adopted an approach of focussing basically on domestic 
economic management in the developing countries, rather than on the interna- 
tional cooperation which had so far formed the sum and substance on the North- 

South dialogue. They also sought to bring in political overtones by emphasizing
 
participatory governments, respect for human rights, and market orientation as 

basis of economic management. While these differences of perception were 
satisfactorily resolved in important meetings and conferences, some of the majo
r 
 
                          <br>    pg63 <br>
 
Concerns of developing countries in the area of international cooperation such 
as 
debt, financial flows, trade and commodity prices have not received the attenti
on 
they deserve. 
 
  While there was little tangible progress in economic negotiations, the 
international economic outlook remained uncertain. The developing countries in 

particular continued to face formidable difficulties. The debt crisis has conti
nued 
to proliferate. No additional initiatives were taken during the past year to 
resolve the proliferation of the debt problem. In fact, there were no major 
developments in the international monetary and financial field. In the later ha
lf 
of 1990, concerns began to increase about a possible recession in the world 
economy which would have an adverse impact on all parts and in particular upon 

the developing countries which have become even more vulnerable to such 
external shocks as well as the East European Countries which are in a process o
f 
transition. <br><br>
 
  The consequences of the Gulf crisis sharpened these apprehensions. The Gulf 

crisis and the resultant increase in oil price has been particularly detrimenta
l to 
the oil importing developing countries. For India the impact has been most 
severe because in addition to the impact of higher oil prices, the situation in
 the 
Gulf has led to disruption of exports, loss of remittances from Indian national
s and 
huge expenses in repatriation of Indians. <br><br>
 
  Developments in the international trading environment continue to dominate 
attention. The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations approached its 

final scheduled phase. The Uruguay Round was called in a background of 
increasingly unsettled conditions in world trade and mounting protectionism in 

the industrialised countries. As the negotiations progress, the developing 
countries found that the issues of greatest interest to them were not being giv
en 
the importance they deserve. Doubts regarding a satisfactory outcome from the 

negotiations increased after the failure of the Brussels Ministerial Meeting to
 
narrow differences amongst powerful trading entities, in particular the United 

States on the one hand and the European Community and Japan on the other 
regarding the question of agricultural trade and subsidies. A failure of the 
Uruguay Round could lead to further disillusionment with the multilateral syste
m 
and an increasing resort to managed trade as well as unilateral measures. 
 
  A fragmentation and regionalisation of the international trading system has 

already appeared on the horizon and could have adverse repurcussions on the 
 
                             <br> pg64 <br>
 
future world trade and prosperity which has to a large extent come to depend 
upon the free and open multilateral trading system. 
 
  It was in the context of these and other fundamental developments taking 
place in the world economy that the initiative to form the Summit Level Group o
n 
South-South Consultation and Cooperation (G-15) was taken at the Non-aligned 
Summit in Belgrade in September 1989. The Group is intended to provide a 
Forum for regular and indepth consultations amongst the leaders of an important
 
group of developing countries. The first Summit meeting of the G-15 was held in
 
Kuala Lumpur in June 1990. The G-15 Group has moved quickly towards 
institutionalising itself and in promoting South-South cooperation programmes. 

The Summit will now be held annually, the next scheduled in Caracas in June 
1991. It has also been decided to set up a small permanent secretariat for the 

G-15. The Summit identified several specific projects for South-South cooperati
on 
which have progressed satisfactorily in the short time since the Kuala Lumpur 

Summit.<br><a name="Administrative and Budgetary Matters">Administrative and Budgetary Matters</a></td></tr>

efforts with other developing countries to encourage greater transparency and 

fairness in the determination of scale of assessments. Under a proposal put for

the relevance of the Non-Aligned Movement. During the cold war period, the 
Non-aligned countries pursued three major objectives. First, they sought to 
protect their own independence of action by staying clear of the two power 
blocs' confrontation. Secondly, they sought to create an 'area of peace' 
between the opposing military alliances and thereby promote the maintenance of 

world peace. Thirdly, they promoted creation of an equitable world order.

  An Indian delegation participated in two sessions (March and October 1990) 
of the Standing Committee of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nucle
ar 
Damage, 1963, which were held in Vienna under the auspices of the International
 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). At the second session, the Standing Committee 
established a Drafting Committee to draft texts for the revision of the Vienna 

Convention which provides for Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage within certain
 
financial limits. It is expected that further meetings would be held to achieve
 
consensus on most of the issues before an international conference is convened 
to 
revise the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.

  India participated in the 29th Annual Session of Asian African Legal Consulta
- 
tive Committee (AALCC) which was held in Beijing from 12 to 17 March 1990. 
As in the past, the AALCC provided a forum for the Legal Experts of the two 
continents to come together to exchange views on several contemporary legal 
problems. These included the status and treatment of refugees, law of the sea, 

definition of terrorism to distinguish it from liberation struggle, Geneva Conv
en- 
tion on law of war and deportation of Palestinians, legal regime concerning 
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and their disposal and extradition. 

Views were also exchanged on legal problems concerning international trade 
law being discussed in UNCITRAL and in other forums. <br><br>
 
  A meeting of legal experts was held in Colombo from 29 January to 1 
February 1990 to draft the text of the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and 

Psychotropic Substances. The convention set out the acts which the member 
states were required to declare as offences and to make them punishable as grav
e 
offences under their domestic law. It required them to cooperate in the 
investigation, prosecution and prevention of drug offences and set out in detai
l the 
measures of mutual legal assistance to be afforded to one another as well as 
matters regarding extradition of drug offences. The convention also provided 
that the plea that the offence was a political one could not be a ground for de
nial 
of extradition of an alleged drug offender. The convention was signed on behalf
 
of India and other SAARC member states on 23 November 1990 at the Fifth SAARC 

Summit at Male. It will enter into force upon ratification by the member states

  THROUGH<br><br> the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) 
programme and Special Commonwealth African Assistance Programme 
(SCAAP) administered by the Ministry of External Affairs, the Government of Ind
ia 
continued to expand and intensify economic and technical cooperation with 
fellow developing countries bilaterally as well as through regional organizatio
ns 
such as Southern African Development Cooperation Council (SADCC) and 
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) during the year under review. 
 
  Fresh assistance in the form of project aid, training, techno-economic survey
s 
and deputation of Indian experts was made available to Afghanistan, Vietnam, 
Zimbabwe and Zambia during the year. A number of ongoing projects under the 
ITEC Programme, including feasibility reports and equipment supplies, were eith
er 
completed or continued, particularly in respect of Mauritius, Vietnam, Cambodia
, 
Ethiopia and Afghanistan.<br><br> 
 
  Construction of a 300-bed Gynaecological and Obstetrics hospital, additional 

industrial sheds, cooperation in agriculture, cartography, meteorology and tour
ism 
were the major new areas identified for project assistance and equipment 
supplying to Afghanistan. In addition, deputation of 35 experts and training of
 50 
nominees were agreed upon; In respect of Zambia also, India agreed to consider 

the setting up of a pilot agricultural tool making unit, apart from deputing up
to 20 
ITEC experts and training of 40 Zambian nominees in various fields. In 
Zimbabwe's case a protocol of cooperation in sericulture was signed and an 
agreement to depute 5 experts and earmark 10 training slots was reached. 
During the Indo-Vietnamese joint Commission Meeting, the then External Affairs 

Minister, Shri I K Gujral formally handed over to Vietnam the Rice Research and

  About 369 nominees (including 86 from the previous year) from developing 
countries were trained under ITEC programme for a period ranging from six 
months to 1 1/2 years. Under SCAAP, 437 nominees from the developing countries 

were admitted in various technical courses. The training courses ranged from sm
all 
scale industries to hotel management, computerisation, manpower, foreign trade,
 
diplomacy, audit and legislature drafting. Non-civilian trainees numbered 330. 

 
  Requests for ITEC experts from over 33 developing countries were enter-

    <td> POLICY PLANNING AND RESEARCH<br> 
 
  DURING the year under review, the Policy Planning Division interacted 
with other Divisions of the Ministry. It also participated in inter-Ministerial
 
and inter-Departmental meetings, in particular, the joint Intelligence Committe
e. 
 
  The Division has initiated steps to enlarge the areas of contacts with the 
academic circles, the UGC and the affiliated Area Study Centres of various 
Universities. Methods to utilise the academic inputs are being evolved. 
 
  The Division was associated with several non-governmental organizations in 
arranging various Conferences and Seminars on current international issues. 
Several of them were financed by the Division. 
 
  The Historical Division being the Research Wing of the Ministry interacts wit
h 
various Territorial Divisions in the preparation of Notes, Research Papers and 

Backgrounders on issues relating to international developments. The Division 
rendered all possible help to the Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific 

information or documents on international relations were required.<br><br> 
 
  The Division coordinates with the concerned Territorial Divisions and deals 

with requests from Research Scholars for access to the records of the Governmen
t 
of India relating to the restricted areas or the Closed Period as laid down in 
the 
Access Rules. The Division further scrutinises the excerpts of the Closed Perio
d 
records submitted by the Research Scholars and accords final clearance after du
e 
consultation with the concerned Territorial Divisions. 
 
  The Division undertakes the task of examining the inaccurate depiction of 
India's international boundaries in all foreign publications, private as well a

official, and maintains contacts with Missions abroad for taking up the matter 
with 
the publishers or the Government authorities for proper presentation and 
necessary corrective measures. 
 
  The Division closely coordinates with the Survey of India and the Ministry of
 
Defence on the question of supply of map sheets to various Government and semi-
 
Government agencies for use in their official work. 
 
  On India's boundary problems, the Division extended necessary assistance to 

the particular needs of the related Territorial Divisions. 
 
  To support the research efforts, a well stocked Library is maintained with ov
er 
one hundred thousand books and documents in its collection. 
During 1990 alone, 1900 books, 135 maps, 650 pamphlets and 54 reels of 
microfilm were added. The Library subscribes to 610 periodicals (489 foreign 
and 121 Indian), besides 41 daily newspapers (28 foreign and 13 Indian). 
 
  Library is equipped with in-house computer system with seven terminals; a 
microfilm/fiche reader printer and a plain paper photocopier. <br><br>
 
  Documentation/Bibliographic Services as well as other library operations and 

services were computerised using an integrated software package developed in 
India. Information about books and selected periodical articles received in 
library since 1986 is available on-line through each terminal. All new docu- 
ments received in Library--books, maps, microforms, selected articles from peri
od- 
icals etc--were fed into the in-house computer system to create database on 
Foreign Affairs. Using this database, the Library provides Current Awareness 
Service and Bibliographical Services. In addition, the Library regularly issued
 a 
monthly Chronicle of Events, a Foreign Affairs Documentation Bulletin and an 
annotated monthly list of books added to the library. 
 
  Library users including Research Scholars can have access to on-line computer
 
based information held in Library in different databases through Foreign Affair

  THE External Publicity Division is charged with the task of projecting 
India's foreign policy and aspects of Indian life while countering adverse 
publicity overseas. To this end, this Division, during the year under review, w
as 
actively engaged in the dissemination of daily information on developments in 

India to its Missions abroad; projecting the scientific, industrial and technol
ogical 
developments in India through articles and documentaries and providing material
 
to the Missions abroad to enable them to effectively advocate India's stand on 

issues of international import and developments within India itself 
 
  The Division regularly briefed the foreign and Indian media about India's 
policies. Stress was laid on the coverage of important international events and
 
developments in the region particularly the situation in the Gulf, and in 
neighbouring countries and India's policy towards them. The Missions in foreign
 
countries were supplied with information on the communal situation in India; th
e 
extremely successful Indian effort in evacuating its nationals following the Ir
aqi 
troops entry into Kuwait; India's efforts to foster an environment of peace and
 
development in the region; the Indian contribution to making the SAARC an 
effective instrument of regional development and the Government's policy to 
tackle the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab etc. <br><br>
 
  In order to acquaint the foreign media and Press with developments in India, 

the Press Relations Section of the Division organized interviews for the foreig
n 
media with dignitaries such as the Indian Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and
 
others. The Press Relations Section also provided the necessary assistance to 

Indian journalists who were visiting other countries to cover foreign policy is
sues; 
it coordinated the approval of documentary films made by foreign film companies
 
 
                              <br>pg79<br>
 
and also provided the necessary media coverage for all foreign delegations 
visiting India as well as for foreign visits of VVIPs from India including cove
rage 
of the Fifth SAARC Summit held at Mate in November 1990. 
 
  During the period from Apr 01, 1990 to 31 January 1991, one hundred 
eighty four documentaries were approved by the Press Relations Section of the 

Division. Foreign journalists from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Hungary, the Philippi
- 
nes and Indonesia were provided hospitality. In addition, ten scholar journal- 

ists visited India during January 1991 on full hospitality granted by the Divis
ion. 
 
  Of the VVIPs visits to India, among others, the Press Relations Section was 

extensively involved in the coverage of the visits of Prime Minister of Japan 

between April and May 1990; Bangladesh Foreign Minister in May 1990; Prime 
Minister of Nepal in June 1990; Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan in 

June 1990; Mrs Brundtland as Chairperson of World Commission on Environ- 
ment and Development in September 1990, Cambodian Prime Minister in 
October 1990; Dr Nelson Mandela in October 1990; King of Bhutan in 
November 1990; and the President of Nauru in December 1990. <br><br>
 
  The activities of the anti-nationalist elements overseas were closely moni- 

tored and efforts were made to counter adverse publicity in the foreign Press 

and media generated by organizations and individuals supporting the extremist 

and secessionist elements in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Special briefings 
were held on the then External Affairs Minister's visit to Sri Lanka, China, 
Belgrade and Iran; Deputy Minister for External Affairs' visit to Algiers and 

Harare; Foreign Secretary's visit to Malaysia and Iran; Secretary(East)'s visit
 to 
Cambodia; as also visits of the Presidents of Maldives, Germany and Romania; 
and the Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Vietnam to India in 
January 1991. 
 
  In order to keep foreign audiences acquainted with the multi-faceted 
character of India, the Division undertook the production of quality documen- 

taries. During the year, subjects like Muslims in India, Christianity in India 

and Information on Technology in India were covered. A documentary 
'Figures of Thought' portraying the life and work of three noted contemporary 

painters was completed. The documentary received excellent reviews in the 
national media and was assessed by the film critics as a highly creative work o
f 
art. The film was also selected for the Panorama Section in the International 

Film Festival held in Madras in January 1991. Similarly, documentaries on 
 
                                 <br>pg80<br>
 
Bharatnatyam dance produced by the noted exponent of Bharatnatyam Leela 
Samson and on Odissi dance by Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra are in the pipeline. 
 
  To coincide with the historic visit of Dr Mandela, the Division organized the
 
production of a documentary on Dr Mandela's life which was telecast during his 

stay in India. The Division also arranged for the telecast of documentaries on 

India in other countries under the Cultural Exchange Programme on the occasions
 
of Indian Independence and Republic Days. 
 
  A Photo Exhibition on the late Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh was 
organized in April 1990 to celebrate his birth centenary. The Division continue
d 
to supply Missions abroad with feature films and documentaries on India for 
telecast by local television stations as well as screening by Missions to local
 
audiences. Photographs of national leaders and personalities were sent to 
Missions to be utilised by the local media for their magazines and journals and
 for 
special supplements on India. 
 <br><br>
  The Division continued to assist Indian Missions with material to be publishe
d 
in 'house journals' in different languages which were locally distributed by th
e 
Missions to provide uptodate information on developments of significance in Ind
ia. 
In addition, the Division launched the Urdu and Arabic editions of its prestigi
ous 
magazine 'India Perspectives,' The Division also brought out a book on 'Muslims
 in 
India' in English, Urdu and Arabic which was highly appreciated by recipients i
n 
many countries and the Division received a number of demands for additional 
copies. The 'Muslims in India' is the first in a planned series of books on dif
ferent 
communities in India aimed at projecting their contribution to the creation of 
a 
modem, secular India.

  IT is estimated that there are about 12 million persons of Indian 
origin residing in different parts of the world. These include those who 
continue to retain Indian citizenship. 
 
  It has been the consistent policy of the Government of India that persons of 

Indian origin who have taken foreign citizenship should identity themselves wit
h 
and integrate in the country of their domicile. The Government naturally 
remains alive to the interests and general welfare of the Overseas Indians and 

encourages cultural contacts with them. <br><br>
 
  Indian citizens residing abroad are primarily the concern of the Government 

of India and the Government continues to exercise due care for their safety and
 
welfare and takes all necessary steps in this regard. It was in keeping with th
is 
obligation and keeping in view the wishes of the Indian community that the 
Government organized the evacuation of nearly 1.5 lakh Indians from Kuwait and 

Iraq following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait on Aug 02, 1990, the work being 

coordinated by the Special Coordination Unit and the Overseas Indians Division.
 
 
  The Division has been created in the Ministry with a view to develop social, 

economic, and cultural contacts between India and the Overseas Indians. Mis- 
sions have been instructed to maintain close contacts with Overseas Indians and
 
render all possible assistance. The Division disseminates information about 
matters of interest to Overseas Indians through Missions abroad. It also

                                             PASSPORT AND CONSULAR SERVICES<br> 
 
  DURING the year 1990, several innovative measures were introduced by the 
Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division to rationalise, simplify and further
 
streamline the functioning of the passport offices in India and consular sectio
ns of 
the Indian Missions/Posts abroad. These measures were initiated to maintain a 

time schedule in issue of passport and render prompt and efficient service in a
ll 
types of cases by the passport offices to the public all over India. The visa p
olicy 
was also amended considerably. One of the various recommendations made by the 

All India Passport Officers' conference held from 14 to Feb 16, 1990 in New 
Delhi pertained to the handling of Mission's references by opening a separate d
esk 
in the passport offices. The conference also recommended simplification of the 

procedures in general. These have been implemented.<br><br> 
 
  A new verification system to issue passports expeditiously was introduced 
from 1 June 1990. Under this system, any Government servant/employee of the 
Public Sector Undertaking applying for passport through the Head of Department 

with No Objection Certificate (NOC), any sitting or former MP/MLA/MLC, any 
child below 15 years of age, and any person who applies for a passport with a 

prescribed, verification certificates signed by a competent officer can be give
n 
passport without prior verification. In all other cases, passport is to be issu
ed 
after four weeks of waiting for the police/CID verification reports. This syste
m 
has proved very useful in cutting down delay in issue of passports all over Ind
ia. 
 
  It has also been decided that from 16 August 1990 all international passports
 
will continue to be in force for 10 years at a stretch and a fresh passport val
id for 
10 years is to be issued on final expiry of a passport after 10 years from the 
date 
of its issue, without conducting any prior police verification. 
 
                              <br>pg85<br>
 
  Other procedures streamlined relate to: 
 
<br>(a)   Waiver of Submission of NOC by Government servants/ 
      employees holding passports for ten years; 
 
<br>(b)   Acceptance of application for renewal of passports earlier than one year 

      of the expiry of its initial validity; 
 
<br>(c)   Issue of police clearance certificates for Kuwait repatriates; 
 
<br>(d)   Abolition of the system of affixing thumb impression by literate persons 

      on passport application form; 
 
<br>(e)   Acceptance of notarised affidavit as proof of date of birth and marital 

      status of ladies (acceptance of a. couple's photograph and sworn 
      affidavit/marriage certificate); and 
 
<br>(f)   In a bid to further simplify the passport application forms, their number
 
      has been reduced from 4 to 2. Separate forms have been prescribed 
      for India and Missions. 
 
  <br><br>As a part of the programme of expansion of Computerisation, Regional 
Passport Office, Delhi was computerised by installation of 436 computers. 
 
  The Government of India made various relaxations in 1990 relating to the 
grant of visas to foreign nationals. Accordingly, tourists can avail of six mon
ths 
multi-entry visas. Foreigners who are frequent visitors and foreigners, of Indi
an 
origin can be granted five years multi-entry visas also. 
 
  Efforts are being made for the issue of visas on the same day or maximum by 

the next working day. 
 
 <br><br> Visa fees for foreign nationals vary from country to country, as the prime 
consideration is reciprocity. Recently, in order to promote tourism, visa fees 
for 
the nationals of Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Fr
ance, 
the USA and the UK were unilaterally reduced for one year on an experimental 
basis. 
 
                              <br>pg86<br> 
 
  As a gesture to elder persons, the Government of India introduced a scheme 
of giving gratis visa for persons above 65 years of age. 
 
  In addition, a new mode of payment of visa fees was introduced for the 
convenience of visa seekers. Thus, payments can now be made by cheques, 
credit cards and traveller cheques as well. 
 
  The Government of India have recently liberalised Landing Permit facilities t
o 
foreigners with certain exceptions. <br><br>
 
  Prevention of Photo substitution and other types of forgeries is one of the 

prime concerns of a Passport Issuing Authority. In order to minimise such 
forgeries in Indian passports, the More Secured Passports (MSPs) were introduce
d 
in 1990. 
 
  About 400 cases of passport forgery were detected. Concerned Passport 
Officers were asked to initiate necessary action in all cases. These cases rela
te to 
passports issued before the introduction of the MSPs. <br><br>
 
  About 400 cases for issue of Identity Certificate were processed and approval
 
conveyed to the Passport Officers. 
 
  Fifty cases of South Africa endorsements on Indian Passports including visits
 of 
cultural/Press groups were also processed. 
 
  Twenty eight appeals, were received during the year of which seven were 
decided. Ten appeals of previous years were also decided.<br><br> 
 
  Over 1100 complaints in respect of delay in issue of passports by various 
Passport Officers were reported of which over 600 cases were settled. 
 
  Two hundred twenty five cases of renewal and 50 cases of fresh recognition 
of Travel Agencies were approved. 
 
  During 1990, one thousand twenty four cases of deportation of Indian 
nationals by Foreign Governments were brought to the notice of the Government 

Of India. Indian Missions and Posts abroad repatriated 86 Indian nationals on 

Government cost. During the year, approximately 4726 Indian nationals were 
arrested in foreign countries. All possible consular assistance was rendered to
 
them and in some cases their release and return to India was facilitated. 
 
                              <br>pg87<br> 
 
  Five hundred thirty one cases of death of foreign nationals in India were als
o 
handled. About 905 cases of death compensation in respect of Indian nationals 

died abroad were processed. One lakh three thousand one hundred eighty one 
documents received from the public for submission to foreign authorities were 

attested/authenticated by the Division. 
 
  The work relating to the administration of the passport offices was made more
 
accountable. According to the suggestion made by the All India Passport 
Officers' conference, a new transfer policy has been evolved modifying the 
guidelines of 1982, keeping in view the welfare of all the officials especially
 those 
of group 'C'. 
 
  Passport, offices at Srinagar, Bareilly, Trichy, Patna, Panaji, Lucknow and 

Guwahati were inspected during the year. The then External Affairs Minister 
visited and inspected RPO Bombay and PLO Trivandrum. 
 
  During the year 1,538,783 new passports were issued. Appendix VII details 
the input-output figures in respect of passports and miscellaneous services. 
Appendix VIII gives the revenue-expenditure figures. In addition, a total of 
1425 Diplomatic and 4651 official passports were issued. 
Seven thousand two hundred eighty miscellaneous services were also rendered.

February 1990. Presently the work of that office is being looked after by the 

Regional Passport Office, Delhi.<br><br>

<tr><td> USE OF HINDI IN OFFICIAL WORK HINDI Section of this Ministry is responsible for the implementation of 
Official Language policy of the Government of India at the Headquarters, 
Regional Passport Offices located in India and Missions/Posts abroad and also f
or 
propagation of Hindi abroad. In addition, it caters to the entire translation w
ork 
from English to Hindi and vice versa of the Ministry. During the year under 
review, the Ministry reconstituted its Hindi Advisory Committee and organized i
ts 
first meeting on Sep 30, 1990. There is an Official Language Implementa- 
tion Committee also in the Ministry and during the year its meetings were held 

and action taken on the decisions adopted therein. 
 
  During the year, the Ministry implemented various schemes of progressive use 

of Hindi at the Headquarters. Three workshops for those who have attained the 

working knowledge of Hindi were organized to remove their hesitation in doing 

their official work in Hindi. <br><br>
 
  Twenty seven sections were inspected with a view to review the progress 
made by them in the implementation of official language policy of the Govern- 

ment. During the inspection, deficiencies were pointed out and defaulting 
sections were ordered to remove them. 
 
  Six typists were nominated for Hindi Typing Training and five officers were 

also sent for Hindi training. In compliance of the Department of Official 
Language's instructions, Hindi Week was observed and various competitions were 

organized. Special Consultation Cell was set up at Akbar Bhawan during the 
week to remove the problems faced by the employees intending to do their 
official work in Hindi. 
 
                              <br>pg94<br> 
 
  The Ministry introduced a Rajbhasha running shield scheme for its Regional 
Passport Offices located in India to encourage them to do maximum work in Hindi
 
during the year. The scheme carries a running shield and a cash award of 
Rs 1000 as First Prize, a cup with a cash prize of Rs 750 as Second Prize and a
 cup 
with a cash prize of Rs 500 as. Third Prize. As a result, Passport Offices in 

Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Jaipur and Delhi gave good performances. Passport Office at 

Ahmedabad is doing nearly cent percent of its official work in Hindi. The 
Committee of Parliament on Official Language visited Passport Offices at Calcut
ta 
and Ahmedabad and also the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. 
 
  The quarterly progress reports regarding progressive use of Hindi received 
from Passport Offices were reviewed and deficiencies pointed out. They were 
advised to adhere to the rules. 
 
  In discharge of its obligation regarding propagation of Hindi abroad, the 
Ministry processed the demands received from the Governmental and Non- 
Governmental bodies, and individuals engaged in the propagation of Hindi abroad
 
and sent the required Hindi teaching aid material, Hindi typewriters etc to the
m 
through Indian Missions free of cost. In addition, the Ministry proposes to 
donate a kit of Hindi teaching aid material to 100 Universities/Institutions te
aching 
Hindi abroad. The proposal was approved by the Finance Division of the 
Ministry and the material is expected to be despatched shortly.<br><br> 
 
  During the year, the Missions abroad were requested to explore the 
possibilities for the propagation of Hindi in the country of their accreditatio
n. 
Embassy of India, Seoul organized debates in the Hangcook University of foreign
 
studies and the foreign participants were suitably rewarded. Besides, the 
Missions in Port Louis, London, Kathmandu, Port of Spain, Paramaribo and 
Georgetown were doing good work. Hindi classes for children continued to be 
held in the Missions and this scheme produced good results. 
 
  As in the past, OSD (Hindi) was sent to New York to help the members of the 

Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly intending to speak in Hindi during
 
the year. He also visited Guyana and Trinidad &amp; Tobago with a view to explore 

the possibilities of propagation of Hindi in these countries.

<tr class="evenRow"><td> CULTURAL RELATIONS 
 
  THE Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) which was established in 
1950 with the basic objectives of establishing and strengthening cultural 
relations and exchanges between India and other countries continued to work 
steadily during the year under review. 
 
  The Council while maintaining traditional and historical ties with all countr
ies 
in the field of culture, continued to make special efforts to strengthen its 
interaction with and the projection of culture in Asia, Africa and Latin Americ
a. 
 
  Among the highlights of this year's activities, the ICCR, in association with
 the 
Sangeet Natak Akademi, convened the India International Puppetry Festival in 
September 1990 which consisted of performances, workshops, symposium and 
exhibitions of puppets and masks from 26 countries in six continents. The 
groups visited over 25 cities in India. ICCR in collaboration with the Sangeet 
Natak 
Akademi also convened the India International Dance Festival with eminent 
dancers and choreographers conducting performances, lecture demonstrations 
and a special workshop for Indian dance students. The participants were drawn 

from 24 countries and they interacted with their Indian counterparts. They also
 
presented over 50 shows in various Indian cities and towns. A symposium was 
held on "International Trends in Puppetry" and a seminar on "Dance : Plural 
Vocabularies on Movement" to coincide with these two festivals. A workshop 
on "Towards on Open Technique" was also organized during the Dance Festival, 
conducted by Mr Charles Reinhart, Director, American Dance Festival, USA. A 
number of foreign and Indian experts participated in these events. 
 
                             <br>pg96<br> 
 
  Both these festivals were the first of their kind to be held in India on this
 
scale. Their emphasis on interactive activities between Indian and foreign 
maestros and experts, and the participation of countries from Asia, Africa and 

Latin America on large scale have been widely acclaimed and welcomed by 
participants and the press alike. 
 
  This year, Africa Day was celebrated on May 25, 1990 with a special African 

Festival called The Arts of Africa 1990 involving performing groups from 6 
countries and exhibitions from 5 countries of Africa. Special invitees on the 

occasion were Mr Alfred Nzo, Secretary General of the African National Congress
 
and Mr J W Wentworth, Minister of Education and Culture from Namibia. It was 
the biggest presentation of events from Africa to be seen in India. The 
response to and public participation in these events were enthusiastic and 
heartwarming. <br><br>
 
  The Council also organized a series of events entitled Switzerland in India 

1991 (February-March 1991) in reciprocity to the India in Switzerland events 
held in 1987. These included visits by three performing arts groups, four 
exhibitions, a film festival and a poets' and writers' symposium. Special guest
s 
included Swiss Senator Rosemarie Simmon, noted artist Hans Erni and photo- 
grapher Rene Burri. 
 
  The Council also organized a series of concerts under the Parivar Parampara 

and Guru Shishya Parampara, a festival of Chhau dances and special performances
 
on the occasion of important seminars, conferences and VIP gatherings. 
 
  It may be noted that in keeping with our special interest in inviting groups 

from priority areas, the Council received 15 groups from Asia, 10 from Africa, 

8 from Latin America and 2 from West Asia. This was close to 50% of the total 

number of foreign groups visiting India during the period under review. 
 
  The 1990 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Memorial Lecture was delivered by 
Nobel Laureate Sir Andrew Huxley on 19 March 1991 on the theme "Science : A 
Supra-National Activity." 
 
  The winners of the 1989 Maulana Azad Eassay Competition on "Secularism 
and Nationalism" were given prizes on 8 September 1990 by the Vice President 
of India at the closing ceremony of the Maulana Azad Centenary celebrations. 
 
                              <br>pg97<br> 
 
  ICCR organized a civic reception and a cultural programme in honour of 
Dr Nelson Mandela at Indira Gandhi Stadium in Delhi on 15 October 1990 which 
was well attended and televised nation-wide. 
 
  The 1989 Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding has been 
conferred on Mr Robert G Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe and will be awarded to 

him on his visit to India. 
 
  During the period under review, the Council sponsored 63 cultural troupes to 

participate in important international festivals and to give individual perform
ances 
at the invitations of foreign governments as well as private institutions. A ma
jor 
effort was made to participate effectively in the "Ramayana Festival" held in 

Mauritius in August 1990 with not only performing arts but also several delegat
es 
and an exhibition on Ramayana Crafts. The artists sent abroad included 
prominent dancers such as Sanjukta Panigrahi, Sonal Mansingh and Vyjayanthimala
 
Bali in various classical disciplines such as Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi, Manipuri
, 
Kathak and Odissi. Similarly, eminent musicians such as Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, D
r 
L Subramaniam, Maharajapuram Santhanam, Hari Prasad Chaurasia and Arvind 
Parikh were sponsored to various countries. Popular music group of Usha Uthup 

and Remo Fernandes were also sponsored in addition to folk music and folk dance
 
groups from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Rajasthan etc. Special efforts 
were made to project Indian theatre abroad by sending the theatre groups of 
Rattan Thiyam, Dinesh Thakur and the Yaksharanga Kendra group led by Kota 
Shiva Rama Karanth. 
 
  The Council has been responsible for the welfare of foreign students studying
 
in India. In June 1990 all work of scholarships for foreign students, which was
 
being dealt with by the Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resource 
Development, was handed over to the Council. About 1800 government scholars 
studying under various scholarships schemes now come under the direct purview 

of the Council. ICCR has already initiated several steps to streamline the 
handling of this work, including computerization of all foreign students data, 

enhancing substantially the stipend for all foreign student scholarship holders
, 
strengthening the role of Foreign Students Advisors at the Universities and the
 role 
of ICCR's Regional Directors in handling foreign students work.<br><br> 
 
  The Council organized a number of programmes for the welfare of foreign 
students during the year under review. There was one summer camp in Shimla- 
Kulu-Manali and the second covering Ooty-Mysore-Bangalore. Over 65 foreign 
 
                              <br>pg98<br> 
 
students from different countries paritcipated in these two camps. Five study 

tours were organized to Bombay and Goa during the December vacations. Over 
225 foreign students from various countries participated in these study tours. 

Foreign Students Day was celebrated on 11 November 1990 in Delhi and all the 
Regional Offices for the benefit of foreign students studying in India. 
 
  For promoting greater awareness and appreciation of Indian cultural heritage 

abroad, the Council has established Indian Cultural Centres in Georgetown 
(Guyana), Jakarta (Indonesia), Moscow (USSR), Port Louis (Mauritius) and 
Paramaribo (Suriname). The Centre at Fiji was closed in May 1990 along with 
the closure of the Indian Embassy, Indian music, dance and languages are taught
 
at these Centres by Indian teachers deputed by the Council. The Centre at 
Moscow also conducts courses in Yoga with the help of teachers deputed from 
India. These Centres maintain libraries and reading rooms, organize lectures, 

symposia, exhibitions, essay competitions, performances of dance and music, 
staging of plays, screening of films and publication of news bulletins. The 
Centres are expected to develop and maintain contacts with a wide cross section
 
of local citizens including students, teachers, scholars and cultural personali
ties. 
Books, cassettes, video tapes and musical instruments etc have been sent to 
these cultural centres. Separately under various schemes, the Council sends 
abroad Visiting Professors for teaching Indology, Indian languages and allied 

subjects. During the period under review over 21 academics were in position 
abroad. 
 
  The major exhibitions sent abroad during the year were "Splendours of Indian 

Textiles" compiled by Shri Martand Singh to China, and exhibition of textiles, 

handicrafts and books on Ramayana to Mauritius on the occasion of International
 
Ramayana Conference, and paintings and graphics by M F Hussain and Shamshad 
Hussain to Egypt. 
 
  Some of the exhibitions that were received by ICCR were the Art of Chinese 
Carvings, Sculptures from Zimbabwe, Makonde Carvings from Tanzania, Coptic Art

received for display from abroad. 
 
                              <br>pg99<br> 
 
  The Council co-sponsored an exhibition titled "Yankee Traders and Calcutta 
Merchants" under the aegis of the Indo-US Sub Commission on Education and 
Culture. 
 
  An exhibition of Design from Sweden was also circulated in India during this 

period. 
 
  As in the previous years, the Council sent out scholars, writers, intellectua
ls, 
academicians and persons from different walks of life during the year. Emphasis
 
were again put on the developing and neighbouring countries. Out of 117 
persons sponsored by ICCR during the year, 20 were sent to Asia, 30 to Africa,

the special release function arranged by the Ministry of Human Resource 
Development for its 4 volume publication India's Maulana (in English, Urdu and 

Hindi) commemorating Maulana Abut Kalam Azad's contributions to education, 
culture and international understanding. These volumes were brought out in 
commemoration of the centenary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad's birth. This 
decision was in consistent with an announcement made by Pandit Jawaharlal 
Nehru on 24 February 1959 that a collection of the well-known writings and 
speeches of Maulana Azad representing his views on various matters will be 
published by the Government of India. 
 
  The Publication Division of the Council continued to publish quarterly 
journals Indian Horizons and Africa Quarterly in English; Gagananchal in Hindi;
 
Thaqafatul Hindi in Arabic; Recontre avec 1' Inde in French and Papeles de la I
ndia

World Literature, Indian Music (reprint); Science, Socialism and Humanism and 

 
                              <br>pg100<br> 
 
Discovery of India (Vietnamese edition) The following tides are under active 
preparation: Buddhism and National Cultures; Jawaharlal Nehru: An Anthology 
(Arabic edition); Continual Renewal; Directory of Cultural Organizations in Ind
ia;

  The Council participated in International Book Fairs and Book Exhibitions in 

Egypt, Singapore and Malaysia through the National Book Trust. 
 
  The presentation section coordinated the purchase of books and objects of 
art which were sent through our Missions to cultural and educational institutio
ns 
abroad. Major presentations included the sending of several sets of books on 
the Ramayana in different Indian languages to Mauritius. 
 
  As part of the ongoing programme on streamlining and modernising the 
work of the Council, the archives of video and audio recordings of the 
performing art and artistes and maintenance of valid records and data bank of 

performances has been undertaken and is going apace. Special video films were 

produced during the year on the Arts of Africa, the India International Puppetr
y 
Festival and the India International Dance Festival. Extracts from these audio-
 
visual materials were utilised by Doordarshan to ensure public access to these 

events. 
 
  The Council's library continued to offer its services to its readers and 
research scholars. The library now has over 75,000 volumes and had more 
than 5000 visitors this year. Several leading scholars utilised the library's 

services and have acknowledged its contribution in their publication. The 
library has started the preparation of a descriptive catalogue of Maulana Abul 

Kalam Azad's collection of documents presented to the ICCR. The Africa 
Section of the Library was retrieved from Patiala House and now offers oppor- 

tunities for research in African Studies. 
 
  The Computer Section, which began as a part of the library has become 
operational and programmes have been developed for an Artist's Data Bank and 
Foreign Students Data Bank which will be essential for speedy information 
retrieval and safe data storage. 
 
  The Council provides the Secretariat of the Indo-US Sub Commission and 
also coordinates with other departments/organizations. The joint Committee 
 
                              <br>pg101<br> 
 
meetings on Cultural Heritage, and Endeavour and Media were held on 29 and 30 

November and 3 and 4 December 1990 respectively. The Council hosted a full 
meeting of the Indo-US Sub Commission on Education and Culture at Azad Bhawan 

on 29 and 30 March 1990. 
 
  The Council continued to supervise the work of Foreign Cultural Centres in 
India, especially those operating in places where there was no official represe
nta- 
tion of the country concerned. Thus the Council supervises the operations of 
British Council libraries in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Lucknow, Patna, 
Ranchi, Trivandrum and Hyderabad; the Affiance Francaise in Ahmedabad, Banga-
