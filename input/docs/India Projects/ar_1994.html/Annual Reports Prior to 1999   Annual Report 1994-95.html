<tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>The past year presented some exceptional challenges which 
   were managed with satisfactory results. Relations with 
   the major powers and the rapidly growing economies in 
   the world were considerably strengthened. Good relations with our 
   neighbours, with the exception of Pakistan, were incrementally 
   enhanced. Both Houses of Parliament on 10th May 1994 welcomed 
   the results of the multi-party non-racial elections in South Africa 
   and hailed the election of President Nelson Mandela as the Head 
   of State of democratic South Africa, and President Mandela 
   accepted our invitation as Chief Guest for our Republic Day this 
   year. We commemorated the 50th Anniversary of the United 
   Nations and the 40th Anniversary of Panchsheel. 
<br> 
<br>The following broad guidelines characterised the activities of the  
   Ministry: 
<br> 
<br>-- Maintaining the integrity and independence of foreign policy  
   decisions and actions. 
<br> 
<br>-- Consolidating and improving our relationship with world powers. 
<br> 
<br>-- Strengthening relations with our neighbours with a view to promoting  
   peace, stability and mutual confidence in the region and beyond. 
<br>-v&gt; 
<br> 
<br>-- Developing stronger economic and technical relations with  
   neighbouring and other developing countries in the overall context of  
   furthering South-South cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>-- Strengthening the institutions in which we have membership by  
   asserting strong commitment, such as UN, NAM, SAARC, Commonwealth, G-77,  
   G-15, and seeking closer association with ASEAN, APEC, and OECD. 
<br> 
<br>-- Countering Pakistan's negativism and confrontation while reaffirming  
   our readiness for meaningful negotiations with Pakistan on all bilateral  
   issues with a view to fostering good neighbourly relations. 
<br> 
<br>As the only near-universal international body, the United Nations, now  
   with 185 members, represents our hopes for the realisation of the  
   aspirations of humankind. In Resolutions on the 22nd December 1994, both  
   Houses of Parliament reaffirmed India's commitment to the Charter (about  
   which Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said, "I do not think it would be possible  
   to improve upon that language"), and to the greater democratisation and  
   efficiency of the UN Organisation. During the 49th General Assembly, the  
   leader of the Indian delegation proposed four major initiatives in his  
   address; the expansion of the Security Council, both in its permanent  
   and non-permanent membership, to enjoy greater credibility in keeping  
   with the increased membership of the general body, together with India's  
   legitimate claim to be a permanent member on the basis of any objective  
   criteria that might be evolved for permanent membership; the need for a  
   fourth Special Session on Disarmament to reflect the contemporary  
   international security situation after the end of the Cold War; the need  
   for reassertion of initiatives within the UN system to stress the  
   priorities of poverty eradication, economic growth and sustainable  
   development; and, in the light of experience of post Cold War UN  
   peacekeeping operations, the need for a closer look at all aspects of  
   these operations. 
<br> 
<br>Indian peace-keeping operations formed an element in India's foreign  
   policy, being reflective of India's desire to play a positive role to  
   promote normality at a time of need on the part of certain friendly  
   developing countries in difficulties. Thus our presence in 
<br>-vi&gt; 
<br> 
<br>peace-keeping operations during the past year was seen in Somalia,  
   Rwanda, Mozambique, Angola and Liberia. Our representatives, both  
   military and civil, earned high praise for dedication and valour, though  
   the loss of some lives was a matter of sorrow. 
<br> 
<br>At the request of the UN Secretary General, India has agreed to place at  
   the call of the United Nations an integrated stand-by force Of  
   approximately 5000 for faster response when need arises. Actual  
   deployment of this force will however be a matter for national  
judgement. 
<br><br> 
   India will be required to play a constructive, contributory role in the  
   deliberations and decisions of several Summits in 1995. The United  
   Nations celebrates its 50th Anniversary on October 24 in a gathering of  
   leaders in New York. Prior to that have been scheduled the World Social  
   Summit, the SAARC Summit and the Non-aligned Summit, and after that are  
   the G-15 Summit and the Commonwealth Summit. Our preparations for these  
   are being made in the light of the scheduled time-table. 
<br> 
<br>It is hoped that the second SAARC Summit to be held in India will lead  
   to consolidation of the work achieved in the thirteen Committees which  
   have been set up, and beyond this, towards achievement of concrete  
   progress in the commercial and economic fields, especially the SAARC  
   Preferential Trading Arrangement, in which progress has been impeded by  
   the inhibitions of one member-state. SAPTA was to be made operational  
   before December 1995 and the six other members are anxious that this  
   time-table should be implemented. 
<br> 
<br>Relations with most of our neighbours registered substantial progress.  
   The new Governments installed after multi-party elections in Sri Lanka  
   and Nepal have expressed their desire to consolidate and strengthen  
   relations with us; sentiments which we welcome and reciprocate. High- 
   level exchanges of visits with China, including our Vice President to  
   China and the Chinese Foreign and Defence Ministers to India, promoted  
   the trend of establishment of greater confidence and close ties with  
   that country. Total trade with China is increasing rapidly, and it is  
   hoped that the implementation of the Peace and Tranquillity Agreement in  
   border areas will make progress in the ensuing year to clarify the line  
   of actual 
<br>-vii&gt; 
<br> <br>
   control and remove potential confrontation in areas where forces 
   are in close proximity. With Bhutan, a new agreement continuing 
   the system of free trade will be signed, and discussions are taking 
   place for a major 1020 MW hydro-electric project. In the Maldives, 
   the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital built with Indian assistance 
   is already functioning and will be formally inaugurated in 1995. 
   With Myanmar, border- trade arrangements at Moreh/Tamu have 
   been finalised. India has closely followed the activities of a National 
   Convention organised by SLORC to institute political changes 
   under new constitutional provisions with the stated, aim of pro 
   viding greater representative government. 
<br> 
<br>The past months marked no improvement in ties with 
   Pakistan; rather the reverse. Pakistan's attempts to confront India 
   on every issue and to internationalise the Kashmir question 
   continued. The unilateral closure by Pakistan of their Consulate 
   General in Bombay and later the Indian Consulate General in 
   Karachi were designed to heighten tension, and reflected the 
   rejection by Pakistan of numerous initiatives by India to resume 
   a meaningful dialogue on all issues impeding good neighbourly 
   relations between the two countries. Pakistani sponsorship of 
   militancy and terrorism in India continued unabated. 
   Repeated Pakistani, efforts in United Nations bodies to 
   persuade member-states to criticise India in matters relating to 
   Jammu &amp; Kashmir were effectively countered. In the OIC, there 
   are indications that several member-states have wearied of Pakistani's 
   obsessive attempts to introduce an anti-Indian agenda in that 
   organisation. It will be our endeavour to maintain contacts with 
   the OIC Secretariat in Jeddah. 
  <br>  
<br>Both Houses in Parliament on the 22nd February 1994 passed Resolutions  
   condemning Pakistan's interference in India's internal affairs and  
   reiterated the constitutional and legal status of Jammu &amp; Kashmir as a  
   State within the Indian Union. 
<br> 
<br>Visits abroad by the President, the Vice President and Prime 
   Minister and incoming visits of Heads of State and Government 
   of friendly countries have, as usual, helped to enhance the level 
   and content of India's relations with those countries. Prime 
   Minister's visits to three permanent members of the Security 
   Council, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Russian 
<br>-viii&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Federation, gave cause for great satisfaction. He also visited the  
   economic and political power centres o Germany, Vietnam and Singapore.  
   All these visits held significant economic and commercial content. With  
   the United Kingdom, the first ever bilateral investment protection  
   guarantee agreement was concluded. With USA, a substantive joint  
   statement was issued which reflected fully our national position on  
   several important bilateral and international issues. During the Moscow  
   visit, the Rao-Yeltsin Declaration on the Protection of the Interests of  
   Pluralistic States was a landmark document of the greatest contemporary  
   relevance, concerning threats to multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic, multi- 
cultural and multi-religious states in the post-Cold War era. 
<br><br> 
   The Prime Minister's visits to Vietnam and Singapore marked our growing  
   contacts with ASEAN. The second Indo-ASEAN sectoral dialogue is being  
   held within a space of 14 months. ASEAN and the 18 nation APEC grouping  
   have been informed of India's willingness to expand its ties with those  
   organisations. Contacts have been made to associate India with some  
   working groups of APEC and OECD. 
<br> 
<br>Mauritius has taken the initiative along with a small number of  
   countries to consider a new Indian Ocean regional grouping. India has  
   been invited and will participate in the preparatory discussions in Port  
   Louis in March 1995. 
<br> 
<br>In the sphere of external publicity, new initiatives were taken to  
   modernize publicity techniques and upgrade the External Publicity  
   Division's communication infrastructure. Pakistani inspired anti-India  
   propaganda was countered, and a projection of India's potential as a  
   result of the economic reforms has been successful in portraying India  
   as a promising business destination. 
<br> 
<br>The ICCR during the year conducted several programmes; the Festival of  
   India in China, and the exhibit "'The Healing Touch-Ashoka, Gandhi,  
   Nehru" in Japan; an international symposium on Indian Studies was held  
   at Kovalam; the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Maestro  
   Zubin Mehta visited India; a major Bangladesh festival of arts was held;  
   and Maulana Azad lectures were given by the Secretary-General of the  
   United Nations and a former Deputy Premier of Malaysia. The Jawaharlal  
   Nehru 
<br>-ix&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Award for 1992 was conferred on Maurice Strong. The first-ever review of  
   the ICCR Cadre was processed and will be implemented after necessary  
   approvals. 
<br> 
<br>Housekeeping activities in the Ministry required attention. The 
   number of pending applications for new passports pending over one 
   month ' has been brought down from 3.42 lakhs on 31.3.1994 to 1.40 
   lakhs on 31.12.1994. Efforts are being undertaken for a-first-ever 
   cadre review for the Central Passport Organisation, and for 
   updating the three basic Consular and Passport manuals. Nine 
   I Passport offices have been computerised; nine more passport offices 
   are being computerised; financial estimates are being obtained for 
   the remaining 5 which will become operational in 1995-96. 
<br> 
<br>The Policy Planning Division in the Ministry has been revitalised. As  
   many as 90 papers, long and short, have been produced by this Division  
   from February to December 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Unexpected crises such as the Yemen civil war necessitated the  
   evacuation of Indian nationals by air and sea. 1564 Indian citizens and  
   85 nationals of other countries were safely evacuated by the efforts of  
   the Ministry. Most of the Indian nationals have returned to their  
   employment in Yemen. The repatriation in good order of our 17 year old  
   Karachi Consulate General personnel in 9 days was another managerial  
   achievement. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry continued to arrange for the Haj pilgrimage, with the  
   number of pilgrims having increased to 25,000. In coordination with the  
   Central and State Haj Committees, satisfactory arrangements were made  
   for the transportation, stay and other needs of the pilgrims. Facilities  
   for the Kailash-Mansarovar yatra organised by the Ministry were  
   upgraded, and the total number of pilgrims was increased to 370. 
<br> 
<br>It has been decided to open new Missions in the coming year in Slovakia,  
   and Papua New Guinea, and Posts in Houston, Cape Town and Glasgow. Our  
   Embassy in Colombia has been re-opened in the light of the forthcoming  
   Non-aligned Summit in that country. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry's technical and economic cooperation programme continued  
   satisfactorily, underlining our commitment to South- 
<br>-x&gt; 
<br> 
<br>South cooperation and to the economic progress of developing countries,  
   especially our neighbours. Apart from major programmes in Bhutan and  
   Nepal, 630 civilian and military personnel from abroad were trained  
   under the ITEC/SCAAP Programme. 18 experts were deputed to foreign  
   countries. In addition, relief supplies for humanitarian purposes were  
   sent to 21 countries of a value of nearly Rs 8 crores. 
<br> 
<br>The Foreign Service Institute conducted 11 courses from April 1, to  
   January 31, 1995, including 2 for foreign diplomats in which 37 were  
   trained in diplomatic theory and practice. 
<br> 
<br>Efforts were made to optimise progress in purchases of property in India  
   and abroad by utilising in full the year's budget grant. Relocation of  
   personnel was carried out in South Block, Patiala House, and the ISIL  
   Building to improve working conditions. 
<br> 
<br>Cadre reviews, both for the IFS "A" and IFS "B" were processed during  
   the year. The review for the "A" Cadre has been done and is awaiting  
   inter-Ministerial examination, but the "B" review could not, once again,  
   be carried out due to lack of consensus among the various representative  
   bodies of that cadre.

<tr><td>Relations between India and Nepal, which have been close, with a long  
   tradition of friendship and shared history and culture, continued to  
   develop smoothly in 1994-95. 
<br> 
<br>Several high-level exchanges took place between India and Nepal. The  
   Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Shri Bhuvnesh  
   Chaturvedi was present as Prime Minister's Special Envoy at the  
   foundation stone laying ceremony of the Yatri Niwas at Janakpur in June  
   1994. The then Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Shri B  
   Shankaranand represented the Prime Minister at the foundation stone  
   laying ceremony by Nepalese Prime Minister for the Indian-assisted B P  
   Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, Nepal on 19 October  
   1994. At the invitation of the Vice President, Shri K R Narayanan, the  
   Crown Prince of Nepal, Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev paid his first  
   official visit abroad to India in August 1994. 
<br> 
<br>India-Nepal economic relations also gained from the liberalisation of  
   both economies and from the stable and positive framework provided by  
   the 1991 Treaties of Trade and Transit and their further amendments in  
   1993. In the last three years, 48 Indian joint ventures have been  
   approved by Nepal. The State Bank of India and the Union Bank of India  
   have also set up joint ventures in Nepal. Nepalese exports to India  
   during the year 1993-94 were worth Rs 1,176.3 million and imports from  
   India were worth Rs 7,874.63 million. 
<br>-1&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India's commitment to Nepal's economic development continued to be  
   expressed through an extensive cooperation programme. The upgradation of  
   the Jayanagar railway through the supply of new locomotives and  
   carriages was completed during the year as was the supply of city  
   sanitation equipment to Kathmandu Municipality. The formal inter- 
   governmental agreement on the Institute for Health Sciences at Dharan  
   with an associated 300-bed hospital was signed during the year and  
   implementation of the first phase made it possible for the first group  
   of students to be admitted in September 1994. At its completion after  
   another four years, the teaching hospital will be preparing medical  
   graduates to meet Nepal's health needs. The new Sirsiya bridge at the  
   Raxaul border linking the two countries at the point where the traffic  
   in goods and people is the heaviest, was completed during the year. The  
   Rajbiraj industrial estate was formally handed over to the Nepalese  
   government during the year. 
<br> 
<br>Work also continued in the India-Nepal Joint Technical Level Committee  
   on repairing boundary pillars in demarcated stretches of the India-Nepal  
   boundary. Contacts were also begun with the Nepalese authorities with a  
   view to extending cooperation to ecological, soil conservation and other  
   cross-border problems which affect both countries and their peoples. 
<br> 
<br>As a close and friendly neighbour with whom India shares an open border,  
   India's hand of friendship remains extended to the Government and people  
   of Nepal. 
<br> 
<br>India and Bhutan enjoy a close and warm relationship marked by deep  
   mutual understanding. Economic cooperation between the two countries has  
   provided a solid basis for this relationship. 
<br> 
<br>During the year, regular exchanges of views at various levels fostered  
   the traditionally friendly relationship. His Majesty the King of Bhutan,  
   Jigme Singye Wangchuk visited India privately in December 1994 when he  
   met with the President and the Prime Minister. 
<br> 
<br>Bhutan is presently implementing the 7th Five Year Plan (199297) which  
   was launched in July 1992. India is actively involved 
<br>-2&gt; 
<br> 
<br>in implementing portions of the plan. Annual Plan talks were held in  
   February 1994 in New Delhi and the review of Plan was done in September  
   1994 in Thimphu. Major projects such as the airport terminal building at  
   Paro, Kurichu Hydel Project in Eastern Bhutan, hospitals, schools, roads  
   and bridges, transmission lines, rural electrification, survey project,  
   etc are underway. India also continued to cooperate with Bhutan in the  
   field of higher educition, survey and training, and for renovation of  
   culturally important places. 
<br> 
<br>The level of interaction between the Government of India and the  
   Government of Bangladesh remained high. There were visits to New Delhi  
   by the Bangladesh Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism (23 to 26  
   September), Foreign Secretary (22 to 27 September) and the Minister for  
   Industries (20 to 24 November) and to Dhaka by the Governor of Tripura  
   (18 to 21 April), the Chief of Army Staff (24 to 29 April), the Finance  
   Minister (9 to 12 July) to attend SAARC Finance Ministers' Conference,  
   and the Minister of State for External Affairs Shri R L Bhatia (30 and  
   31 July) to attend the meeting of SAARC Council of Ministers. 
<br> 
<br>As a follow-up to the decisions taken during the visit of the Home  
   Secretary to Dhaka in October 1993, the first meeting of Indo-Bangladesh  
   Joint Working Group took place in New Delhi from 29 to 31 March to  
   discuss, inter alia, security-related issues, cross-border movements,  
   the existing visa regime, and the situation along Indo-Bangladesh  
   border. 
<br> 
<br>Director-General level talks between the Border Security Force and the  
   Bangladesh Rifles were held in New Delhi from 10 to 14 January 1994 and  
   in Dhaka from 9 to 12 November 1994 to discuss issues such as repair and  
   maintenance of boundary pillars, cross-border movements, illegal  
   immigration of Bangladeshis into India, transborder crimes and  
   repatriation of Chakma refugees from Tripura to Bangladesh. 
<br> 
<br>India has on several occasions reiterated to the Government of  
   Bangladesh her commitment to holding a constructive bilateral dialogue  
   for arriving at a long-term, comprehensive and equitable arrangement on  
   water sharing with Bangladesh. Bangladesh meanwhile continued to raise  
   the issue of sharing of river waters in international fora. On 6  
   October, the Foreign Minister of 
<br>-3&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Bangladesh made a reference to the subject in his statement at the  
   United Nations General Assembly. 
<br> 
<br>Negotiations between India and Bangladesh on the repatriation of Chakma  
   refugees from Tripura resulted in the return of 5198 refugees to  
   Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh in separate phases (15 to 22  
   February and 21 July to 5 August). Discussion's continue for the  
   resumption of further repatriation at an early. date although there is  
   reluctance on the part of refugees to return on grounds of alleged  
   unimplementation of rehabilitation measures by the Government of  
   Bangladesh. All repatriation is on a strictly voluntary basis. About  
   50,000 Chakma refugees await repatriation in camps in Tripura. 
<br> 
<br>On 20 December, the Bangladesh Festival of Arts was inaugurated jointly  
   by the Bangladesh Minister for Cultural Affairs Prof Jahanara Begum and  
   India's Deputy Minister of Education and Culture, Kum Selja at New  
   Delhi. The two-week long festival was organised by the ICCR and the  
   Department of Culture. This was the first major festival of arts of  
   Bangladesh in India under the bilateral Cultural and Academic Exchange  
   Programme. The festival was concluded at Calcutta on 5 January 1995. 
<br> 
<br>The second meeting of the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Business Council was  
   held in Dhaka from 2 to 4 August to explore possibilities for expansion  
   of economic and commercial cooperation and for setting up of industrial  
   projects and joint ventures. 
<br> 
<br>On 4 January 1995, Bangladesh Railway signed a US $ 10 million agreement  
   with RITES to purchase 10 diesel metre gauge locomotives. The delivery  
   of the locomotives will be completed in 16 months. 
<br> 
<br>India's exports to Bangladesh in 1993-94 were valued at Rs 1349.69 crore  
   while imports from Bangladesh were Rs 56.09 crore. Tariffs on select  
   items of export interest to Bangladesh were reduced. Both sides also  
   held discussions on further measures to intensify and diversify trade  
   and investment. 
<br> 
<br>Under the Aid to Bangladesh Programme, 3 persons received training in  
   India in news agency operations, journalism and rural development. There were, in addition, a large number of  
   Bangladeshi students in India on a self-financing basis.
   <br>-4&gt; 
<br> 
<br>There were several exchanges of visits between India and Myanmar. The  
   visits of the Home Secretary (2 to 7 February), the Chief of Army Staff  
   (9 to 13 May) and the Commerce Secretary (8 to 10 June) to Yangon  
   provided opportunities to pursue the bilateral dialogue. During the  
   visit of a Survey delegation led by the Director General, Survey  
   Department, Government of Myanmar to India from 18 to 22 July,  
   operational matters relating to boundary demarcation, fixation of field  
   season, repair and maintenance of boundary pillars were discussed.  
   Official-level talks with Myanmar for operationalisation of the Border  
   Trade Agreement were held from 10 to 12 January 1995. 
<br> 
<br>Both Governments agreed to consider measures to ensure better border  
   management with a view to maintaining peace and tranquillity on the  
   Indo-Myanmar border. Three sectoral meetings flowing from the Memorandum  
   of Understanding on Contacts between Border Civilian Authorities of the  
   two countries were held at Imphal (7 to 9 March), Kalemyo, Myanmar (23  
   and 24 June) and Aizawl (22 to 24 November). Issues such as activities  
   of insurgents, terrorists, narco-terrorists and other negative elements  
   operating on the Indo-Myanmar border were discussed. 
<br> 
<br>India is watching with interest developments in Myanmar relating to  
   efforts to formulate a new Constitution and recent meetings between Daw  
   Aung San Suu Kyi and the Government of Myanmar (20 September and 28  
   October). 
<br> 
<br>Twenty-eight trainees came to India in 1994-95 for courses on farm  
   machinery, computers, news agency operations, journalism, survey,  
   diplomacy, banking procedure, cooperatives, railway computer  
   reservations and railway signalling and telecommunications. 
<br> 
<br>India's working relationship with Myanmar continued to improve during  
   the year, which saw the exchange of high-level visits and the signing of  
   a Border Trade Agreement. Simultaneously, India continued to support the  
   restoration of democratic government in Myanmar. 
<br>-5&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Relations with Sri Lanka continued to be based on friendship,  
   understanding and good neighbourliness. Soon after Chandrika  
   Bandaranaike Kumaratunga assumed office as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka  
   in August 1994, the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Shri A N  
   Varma visited Colombo as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy to convey  
   felicitations, good wishes and India's interest in strengthening close  
   and friendly ties with Sri Lanka. With her victory in the Presidential  
   elections in November 1994, Kumaratunga obtained a clear mandate for the  
   peace process and constitutional reforms. The President and the Prime  
   Minister sent warm messages of congratulations to President Kumaratunga  
   on her election. 
<br> 
<br>The run up to the Presidential elections saw the tragic assassination of  
   UNP Presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake. The Government of India  
   expressed its shock at the dastardly act in messages sent by the Prime  
   Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. In response to a request  
   from the Sri Lanka Government, India has offered the assistance of  
   forensic and ballistic experts in the investigation of the assassination  
   and requested Sri Lanka to indicate specific aspects on which such  
   assistance is required. 
<br> 
<br>Political dialogue with the new Sri Lanka Government began with the  
   visit of the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar to India  
   from 6 to 10 October 1994, during which he called on the President, the  
   Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Commerce Minister and the Leader of  
   Opposition and held official talks with the Minister of State for  
   External Affairs Shri R L Bhatia. Kadirgamar briefed the Indian  
   leadership about the Sri Lanka Government's agenda including the peace  
   process, constitutional reforms and economic policies. The Government of  
   India wished the Sri Lanka Government success in its efforts. It was  
   reiterated that India has always stood for a peaceful political  
   settlement of the ethnic issue and was watching developments with close  
   interest. 
<br> 
<br>Kadirgamar stressed Sri Lanka's keenness for sound and cordial relations  
   with India and was informed that the Government of India fully  
   reciprocated these sentiments. There was a particular emphasis during  
   the discussions on the need to strengthen and diversify bilateral  
   economic cooperation. It was agreed that matters such as the security of Indian fishermen and the release of boats of Sri Lanka refugees should be resolved early.     
   The Indo-Sri Lanka Joint Commission had earlier held its second session  
   in New Delhi in April 1994. The Joint Commission decided on several  
   measures to consolidate, diversify and strengthen bilateral relations in  
   a wide variety of areas. Some decisions taken in pursuance of the Joint  
   Commission meeting include : restoration of preferential tariff margins  
   on Sri Lankan cloves; reduction in tariffs on select items of export  
   interest to Sri Lanka such as ceramic tiles, glycerine, graphite and  
   rubber; extension of a new line of dollar-denominated credit; permission  
   to Bank of Ceylon to open a branch in Madras; and enhanced seat capacity  
   for airlines following civil aviation talks in July 1994.
   <br>-6&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Indo-Sri Lanka trade stood at Rs 877.3 crore from January to August 1994  
   with exports valued at Rs 830.8 crore and imports from Sri lanka valued  
   at Rs 46.5 crore. During 1993, the total value of trade was Rs 1,131.5  
   crore, with exports at Rs 1,069.5 crore and imports at Rs 62 crore.  
   India's interest in broadening economic relations with Sri Lanka  
   resulted in two delegations from the Confederation of Indian Industries  
   visiting Sri Lanka in March and October 1994. A joint task force has  
   been set up to identify and follow up implementation of specific  
   proposals. 
<br> 
<br>Seventy-seven trainees from Sri Lanka were nominated for courses in  
   India in areas including Statistics, Mill Management, Personnel  
   Management, Maintenance Engineering, Personnel Planning, Packaging  
   Technology, Software Systems, Diplomacy and Cooperative Banking. 
<br> 
<br>About 8,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees returned to their home country in  
   1994 on a voluntary basis. Repatriation took place in two phases in  
   January-February 1994 and in September 1994. 
<br> 
<br>The traditionally close and friendly relations with Maldives were  
   further strengthened and consolidated during the year. 
<br> 
<br>President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom paid a State visit to India from 21 to 25  
   March 1994. He called on the President, met the Vice President and held  
   wide-ranging talks with the Prime Minister on issues relating, inter alia, to Indo-Maldives cooperation,  
   particularly in the fields of health, education and progress of SAARC.
   <br>-7&gt; 
<br> 
<br>There were also visits by a Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker  
   of the Citizens' Majlis, Abdullah Hamid (11 to 19 May), Maldives  
   Minister of State for National Defence and Security, Brig Abdul Sattar  
   Anbaree (19 to 22 September), a Maldivian Civil Aviation delegation (4  
   to 8 November) for discussions regarding the operations of Air Maldives  
   to India, which began shortly thereafter, and by Ahmed Abdullah,  
   Mini ter of Health and Welfare of Maldives (12 to 16 December). 
<br> 
<br>Ships of the Indian Coast Guard visited Maldives in April 1994 and  
   conducted joint exercises with the ships of the Maldivian National  
   Security Service. 
<br> 
<br>The Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital commenced out-patient work on 15  
   October 1994, with a schedule for the phased opera-tionalisation of all  
   departments by the end of the year. Fifty-six Indian deputationists  
   including senior medical professionals are in Male to help start work in  
   the hospital. 
<br> 
<br>Another Government of India project, the Maldives Institute of Technical  
   Education, is under construction at Male. 
<br> 
<br>Fifty-nine Maldivian nominees received training in India during the  
   current year in fields such as medicine, nursing, school administration  
   for headmasters, computer software, banking, horticulture and aviation- 
   related services. 
<br> 
<br>India-Pakistan bilateral relations continued to show a downward trend.  
   Pakistan's sustained efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue, its  
   unabated support to subversion and terrorism directed against India, its  
   intransigence on the issue of resumption of a bilateral dialogue with  
   India and its persistent negative approach have vitiated the atmosphere  
   and prevented any meaningful progress in bilateral relations. In  
   addition to training, equipping, funding and guiding militants, Pakistan  
   has stepped up its trans-border terrorism by inducting mercenaries from  
   third countries into Jammu and Kashmir. Government have strongly urged  
   Pakistan to conduct inter-State relations as a responsible member of the international community and to eschew the threat of  
   terrorism held against India, which is totally unacceptable.
   <br>-8&gt;
<br> 
<br>Consistent with her policy to resolve differences with Pakistan  
   bilaterally and peacefully in accordance with the Simla Agreement,  
   Government have conveyed to Pakistan on several occasions in 1994  
   India's readiness for the resumption of bilateral dialogue without any  
   pre-conditions. On 21 March 1994, Foreign Secretary renewed the offer  
   for the resumption of Foreign Secretary-level talks. At a meeting at  
   Dhaka on 31 July 1994 between Minister of State for External Affiars,  
   Shri R L Bhatia and Pak Foreign Minister, Government reiterated its  
   offer of dialogue. Foreign Secretary followed this up with a letter to  
   his Pakistan counterpart inviting him for talks. On 3 November 1994  
   Government once again formally conveyed to Pakistan through diplomatic  
   channels its offer for dialogue. During his visit to Islamabad from 22  
   to 24 November 1994 to attend the Commonwealth Senior Officials Meeting  
   (COSM), Foreign Secretary conveyed to his Pak counterpart Government's  
   readiness to discuss all bilateral issues. Shri Arjun Singh, the then  
   Human Resource Development Minister during his visit to Pakistan to  
   attend the Commonwealth Education Ministers Meeting (26 to 29 November  
   1994), reiterated India's desire for normalisation of relations.  
   Unfortunately, Pakistan's response has been conditional and negative. 
<br> 
<br>Government proposed on 7 April 1994 and 12 July 1994 to Pakistan that  
   consultations between the two Foreign Offices may be held for a review  
   of the implementation of the Code of Conduct for treatment of  
   Diplomatic/Consular personnel in India and Pakistan, in the light of  
   numerous incidents of intimidatory surveillance and harassment meted out  
   to the Indian Diplomatic Officials and their family members posted in  
   Indian Missions in Pakistan. This proposal, however, did not find favour  
   with, Islamabad. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan has persisted with its restrictive visa policy and other  
   negative measures which further impeded people-to-people contacts  
   between the two countries. On 17 March 1994, Pakistan unilaterally and  
   without justification announced the closure of its Consulate in Bombay.  
   Subsequently, on 26 December 1994 Pakistan asked the Government of India  
   to close down the In-dian Consulate General in Karachi. These actions of Pakistan are  
   regrettable and are patently designed to create perception of tensions  
   between the two countries. Pakistan also assumed an exaggerated air of  
   panic towards the isolated reports of incidents of plague in India. 
   <br>-9&gt;
<br> 
<br>Pakistan's campaign to internationalise and communalise the Kashmir  
   issue continued. At the 50th session of the UNHRC (March 1994), Pakistan  
   had decided to move a resolution on the Human Rights situation in Jammu  
   and Kashmir and aggressively campaigned for support but, subsequently,  
   withdrew its resolution, at the behest of a number of friendly  
   countries. At the 49th session of the UNGA, Pakistan made yet another  
   attempt to table a resolution. However, this attempt also failed. This  
   was the second occasion in 1994 that Pakistan's campaign to agitate  
   Kashmir at an UN forum had petered out. 
<br> 
<br>In the face of Pakistan's campaign of Jammu and Kashmir issue, India  
   apprised the international community of the politically motivated act by  
   Pakistan and emphasised that all outstanding issues between the two  
   countries need to be resolved peacefully and bilaterally within the  
   framework of the Simla Agreement. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan has continued to pursue its nuclear weapons-oriented programme,  
   its clandestine procurement of material for this purpose and its  
   acquisition of sophisticated weapons and arms technology far beyond its  
   legitimate defence requirements. The curtain of ambiguity about the  
   intentions and purpose of Pakistan's nuclear programme has now fallen  
   off with the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif publicly  
   acknowledging on 23 August 1994 about the possession of an atomic bomb  
   by Pakistan. 
<br> 
<br>Government will endeavour, without compromising its unity and  
   territorial integrity, to pursue all available opportunities for  
   normalising relations with Pakistan through a bilateral dialogue within  
   the framework of the Simla Agreement. However, Government are willing to  
   adapt to whatever pattern of relationship Pakistan desires. 
<br> 
<br>There was a major escalation in the conflict in Afghanistan in January  
   1994 which continued through the year and further aggravated the political and security situation in Afghanistan. A new peace initiative launched by the United Nations under the Special Envoy  
   of the UN Secretary General, Ambassador Mehmoud Mestiri is underway. But  
   prospects for a peaceful political settlement in the near future still  
   remain uncertain.
   <br>-10&gt; 
<br> 
<br>There have been some high level exchanges with Afghanistan in 1994,  
   although it has been difficult to keep up the momentum of bilateral  
   exchanges due to the unstable conditions prevailing in Afghanistan. Dr  
   Abdul Rehman, Afghan Minister for Civil Aviation visited New Delhi twice  
   in March and July 1994 as a Special Envoy of Afghan President.  
   Mohammadullah Naqid, Afghan Minister of Martyrs &amp; Disabled Affairs  
   visited India in March 1994. Sayed Noorullah Emad, Afghan Agriculture  
   Minister paid a visit to India in October 1994. 
<br> 
<br>India's cooperation with Afghanistan has consistently focussed on areas  
   which are of direct benefit to the Afghan people. Unfortunately, in the  
   unsettled conditions in Afghanistan, the cooperation programmes have  
   been disrupted. Government have, however, been able to resume some  
   technical cooperation (training facilities, scholarships, medical  
   facilities, etc) during 1994. India has an abiding concern for welfare  
   and prosperity of the Afghan people. During 1994, India has supplied  
   tea, medicines, etc worth Rs 1 crore as relief assistance to various  
   provinces of Afghanistan such as Herat, Kabul and Jalalabad. Despatch of  
   further relief supplies to other provinces is being worked out. 
<br> 
<br>India stands for a united, stable, non-aligned, and independent  
   Afghanistan. India supports a peaceful political settlement which is  
   acceptable to all sections of the people of Afghanistan. India supports  
   the ongoing peace initiative of the UN, and stands ready to make a  
   contribution to peace efforts. 
<br> 
<br>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was  
   established in December 1985 with the adoption of the Charter of SAARC  
   by the Heads of State/Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,  
   Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka at their meeting in Dhaka on 8 December  
   1985. 
<br> 
<br>India views SAARC as an additional dimension to her bilateral  
   relationship with the Member Countries. SAARC can develop into an effective vehicle for collective self-reliance in the region.  
   The recent incorporation of substantive issues of economic cooperation  
   into its agenda could harness the complementarities of the region in a  
   positive manner, if diligently followed up by all Member Countries.  
   India is firmly committed to SAARC and it is her sincere desire to  
   strengthen the Association for the common benefit of all the SAARC  
   Member States.
   <br>-11&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The 14th Session of the SAARC Council of Ministers was held in Dhaka on  
   30 and 31 July 1994. This was preceded by the 14th Session of the SAARC  
   Programming Committee (26 July) and the 19th Session of the SAARC  
   Standing Committee (from 27 to 29 July) held in Dhaka. 
<br> 
<br>The SAARC Council of Ministers reviewed the status of implementation of  
   its earlier decisions as also the status of implementation of Summit  
   decisions. At the time of 7th SAARC summit held in Dhaka on 10 and 11  
   April 1993, a Framework Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading  
   Arrangement (SAPTA) was signed by the Foreign Ministers of the SAARC  
   Member Countries. The 14th Session of the Council of Ministers reviewed  
   the progress in the implementation of the Agreement on SAPTA and urged  
   the Member States to exchange request lists containing the size and  
   nature of concessions to be exchanged by them well in time before the  
   next meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) to be held in  
   Islamabad in September 1994. However, Pakistan has not fulfilled its  
   obligation. It has neither sent any request lists nor organised the 5th  
   Meeting of IGG which it was to host in September 1994. 
<br> 
<br>With a view to evolving a collective position by SAARC Countries on the  
   World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, 1994, India hosted a  
   Workshop in New Delhi from 30 March to 2 April 1994. The Report adopted  
   at the Workshop was presented at the World Conference on Natural  
   Disaster Reduction held in Yokohama, Japan in May 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Bangladesh hosted the Meeting of Finance/Planning Ministers of SAARC  
   Countries in Dhaka on 10 and 11 July 1994. The Ministerial Meeting  
   decided that a mechanism should be set up which would act as a forum for  
   exchange of information on experiences of the SAARC Countries in the  
   implementation of 
 
poverty alleviation programmes. The Ministers suggested this mechanism  
   in the form of a three-tier institutional structure that would meet once  
   a year. The 14th Session of the Council of Ministers commended the  
   Report of the Finance/Planning Ministers and decided to transmit it to  
   the Heads of State or Government.
<br>-12&gt;
<br> 
<br>A SAARC Ministerial Conference on Youth was held in Male from 9 to 11  
   May 1994. A five-member delegation from India led by Shri Mukul Wasnik,  
   Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports attended the Meeting. The  
   Ministerial Conference adopted a 17-point resolution known as "Male  
   Resolution on Youth". The 14th Session of the Council of Ministers  
   appreciated the Male Resolution on Youth and decided to transmit the  
   Resolution to SAARC Heads of State or Government. 
<br> 
<br>As per decision of the 13th Session of the Council of Ministers held in  
   Dhaka on 4 and 5 December 1993, the SAARC Documentation Centre (SDC) has  
   been established and located at the Indian Scientific Documentation  
   Centre (INSDOC), New Delhi. The Governing Board for the SDC has been  
   constituted and its first meeting was held in New Delhi in May 1994. 
<br> 
<br>As per decision of the Seventh SAARC Summit held in Dhaka in April 1993,  
   a SAARC Ministerial Conference on Disabled Persons was held in Islamabad  
   from 16 to 18 December 1993. The Ministers adopted the Resolution called  
   "Islamabad Resolution on Disabled Persons". The 14th Session of the  
   Council of Ministers held in Dhaka on 30 and 31 July 1994 endorsed the  
   Report of the SAARC Ministerial Conference on Disabled Persons and the  
   Islamabad Resolution on Disabled Persons and decided to transmit them to  
   the SAARC Heads of State or Government. India organised a SAARC Meeting  
   of Experts on Rehabilitation Techniques for Disabled Persons from 28  
   November to 2 December 1994 at the National Institute for Mentally  
   Handicapped, Secunderabad. 
<br> 
<br>Within the parameters of the SAARC Charter, discussions are underway  
   between SAARC and some other UN and International Organisations for  
   possible cooperation between SAARC and these bodies.  
   Agreements/Memoranda of Understanding have already been signed between  
   SAARC and ESCAP, UNICEF, 
<br>-13&gt; 
<br> 
<br>APT, UNCTAD. The discussions are underway for cooperation between SAARC- 
   EU, SAARC-ASEAN, SAARC-ADB and SAARC-UNDP. 
<br> 
<br>Under the aegis of SAARC , around 58 activities have been held so far in  
   1994, out of which 16 were held in India. These include training  
   courses, seminars, workshops, technical studies, etc. 
<br> 
<br>India would be hosting the 8th SAARC Summit in April 1995.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>In keeping with India's desire for greater integration with the Asia  
   Pacific, South-East Asia continued to be an area of prime focus during  
   the year 1994-95. The Prime Minister paid official visits to Singapore  
   and Vietnam during the year. The visits to India of President Soeharto  
   of Indonesia and Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia in March 1994 (in  
   the context of G-15) helped to rekindle interest about India at the  
   political as well as trade and economic level in those countries.  
   Foreign Ministers of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and Deputy Foreign  
   Minister of Thailand also visited India during the year. Prime Minister  
   Goh Chok Tong of Singapore who visited India as the Chief Guest for  
   Republic Day 1994, paid another visit in January 1995 in connection with  
   the Centenary celebrations of the Confederation of Indian Industries in  
   Calcutta. Interaction has also taken place at the level of intellectuals  
   and academics, with the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis  
   (IDSA) and India International Centre organising seminars, with the  
   Ministry's support, on India's relations with South-East Asian  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>The on-going economic liberalisation process in India continues to be  
   viewed positively by South-East Asian countries that have investible  
   surplus along with marketing and managerial skills. Efforts to synergise  
   the complementarity in the economies of India and the region continued  
   and succeeded in numerous productive ventures both in India and in the  
   South-East Asia re-gion. Meetings of Joint Business Councils (JBCs) with several countries  
   and seminars on "Doing Business with India" were instrumental in  
   fuelling further interest in the Indian economy, at the same time  
   bridging some of the information gap. There are 96 joint ventures spread  
   over Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and now  
   Vietnam, out of which about 60 are operational. Investment proposals  
   approved so far amount to approximately Rs 900 crore. Last year,  
   Thailand, fox instance, was the 6th largest foreign investor in the  
   country. Trade with South-East Asia has also increased steadily.  
   Currently, India's exports to the region are in the range of Rs 5,500  
   crore, a little less than 10% of her global exports.
   <br>-15&gt;
    
<br><br>The Sectoral Dialogue partnership with ASEAN progressed satisfactorily.  
   The indication from the ASEAN members is that they would welcome the  
   sectoral dialogue to diversify further and at a rapid pace. 
<br> 
<br>The year also witnessed significant developments in regional security,  
   with the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) taking place in  
   Bangkok in July 1994. As an immediate neighbour of South-East Asia  
   sharing common security concerns, India desires to be associated with  
   deliberations of the ARF. The general question of expanding ARF  
   membership is under consideration of the ASEAN countries. 
<br> 
<br>India's bilateral relations with Singapore continued on a dynamic  
   course. Singapore has been fully supportive of India's quest for a  
   deeper involvement with South-East Asia, whether in the form of full  
   dialogue partnership with the ASEAN, or membership of the ASEAN Regional  
   Forum and APEC. There is increasing involvement of private sectors of  
   the two countries in trade and economic cooperation. Several proposals  
   relating to infrastructural development, civil aviation and tourism,  
   information technology, financial services, etc are under consideration. 
<br> 
<br>Prime Minister's visit to Singapore in September 1994 within a short  
   span of eight months of the Singapore Prime Minister's visit to India in  
   January 1994 was instrumental in turning a new chapter in India's  
   relations with Singapore. The discussions, that took place in an  
   atmosphere of warm cordiality and goodwill,focussed primarily on economic exchanges in which both sides saw immense  
   potential ahead. Public housing, power generation, telecommunications,  
   in addition to tourism and civil aviation, were identified as sectors  
   for possible cooperation with Singapore in India. The Prime Minister  
   suggested Singapore's involvement in commercialising new technologies  
   developed by CSIR and also flagged India's interest in further  
   strengthening defence cooperation in such areas as training and  
   equipment. Possibilities of bilateral tie-up for third-country projects  
   were also discussed. A Memorandum of Understanding on, Foreign Office  
   Consultations and a dozen corporate agreements involving areas such as  
   trade and investment, banking, aquaculture, warehousing, real estates,  
   telecommunications, etc were signed during the visit. The Prime Minister  
   also delivered the highly prestigious "Singapore Lecture" on "India and  
   Asia Pacific: Forging a new Relationship", which was followed by a  
   lively question-answer session.
   <br>-16&gt;
<br> 
<br>Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's visit to India again in January 1995  
   signified the growing informality and closeness in the relationship  
   between the two countries of mutual benefit. He met the Prime Minister  
   for a one-to-one meeting, in addition to an encounter with businessmen  
   and a working lunch. A Memorandum of Understanding on Science and  
   Technology was also signed on the occassion, to put in place a framework  
   that will facilitate cooperation in this field, particularly in the area  
   of commercialisation of technologies developed by CSIR, earlier  
   discussed during Prime Minister's visit to Singapore in September 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Prime Minister's visit to Vietnam in September 1994 reaffirmed India's  
   traditionally warm and close relationship in the changing environment.  
   While acknowledging the strength and continuity of bilateral relations  
   between India and Vietnam, both sides agreed that there was need to  
   upgrade economic linkages. With market-oriented reforms taking place in  
   both countries, time was opportune to substantially enlarge areas of  
   economic cooperation. Several new areas including sugarcane cultivation  
   and processing, dairy farming, rubber plantation and manufacture,  
   vegetable oil production, leather processing, etc were identified. Four  
   Agreements were signed during the visit-on Avoidance of Double Taxation,  
   Facilitation of Visas, Defence Coopera-tion and Foreign Office Consultations. In addition, the visiting Indian  
   business delegation signed six corporate agreements relating to  
   investments and joint ventures in Vietnam.
   <br>-17&gt; 
<br> 
<br>As decided during the visit, a Joint Working Group met in New Delhi from  
   16 to 18 January 1995, which reviewed cooperation in all areas and held  
   detailed discussions, in the subgroups, on ways- to further enhance and  
   concretise cooperation, in identified sectors. 
<br> 
<br>With Thailand, there is an excellent understanding at the political  
   level reinforced by periodic exchange of high level visits. During the  
   year, the Thai Parliamentary Committee of Religion, Art and Culture  
   visited places of Buddhist interest in India in September 1994. Deputy  
   Foreign Minister Dr Surin Pitsuwan visited in October 1994 during which  
   comprehensive talks were held. The visit was useful for taking stock of  
   the process on the points of action emerging from the last joint  
   Commission meeting and also for identifying new areas of cooperation. Dr  
   Supachai Panitchpakdi, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand visited  
   Calcutta in January 1995 in connection with CII Centenary celebrations.  
   Secretary level talks were also held (27 January 1995) between India and  
   Thailand in New Delhi. The year also saw the first meeting of the India- 
   Thailand Joint Business Council, an investment Seminar on India and the  
   joint Trade Committee taking place. 
<br> 
<br>India's bilateral trade with Thailand showed a welcome sign of growth  
   with the overall value reaching US$ 601.60 million (approximately Rs  
   1800 crore) during the year 1993-94. From Thailand, investment proposals  
   worth US$ 120 million (approximately Rs 360 crore) were approved in  
   1993, mainly in the fields of fisheries, chemicals, air-conditioning  
   systems, hotel and tourism. Some prominent Thai companies have also  
   signed agreements with Indian companies in telecom sector. Indian  
   investment in Thailand amounted to a total registered capital of US$ 25  
   million during the last year. The Aditya Birla group is the largest  
   Indian investor with three joint ventures. 
<br> 
<br>India's close relations with Indonesia continued to be strengthened  
   during the year. The visit of President Soeharto to New Delhi for the  
   reconvened G-15 Summit in March 1994 offered a 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>fresh opportunity for bilateral exchanges at the highest political  
   level. There were also regular contacts at Foreign Minister's level in  
   connection with the NAM and UN matters. Efforts also continued at  
   official level to expand bilateral interaction in diverse fields. A  
   comprehensive review of bilateral relations with Indonesia was  
   undertaken during discussions at Head of Division's level in Jakarta in  
   December 1994. It was agreed, in principle, to further strengthen the  
   relations through institutionalised mechanism like joint Commission,  
   Foreign Office Consultations, etc.
   <br>-18&gt;
<br> 
<br>India's trade and economic relations with Indonesia are steadily going  
   up. The volume of trade in 1993-94 was US$ 354.36 million (approximately  
   Rs 1100 crore) and has far exceeded the previous year's figure of US$  
   197.19 million (approximately Rs 600 crore). India has 15 joint ventures  
   in Indonesia with investments worth US$ 189 million. 
<br> 
<br>Prime Minister Mahathir's special gesture of visiting India in March  
   1994 for the reconvened G-15 Summit after his visit in the same  
   connection three months earlier, contributed to the strengthening of  
   India's bilateral relations with Malaysia. There is a growing  
   realization today, on the part of both India and Malaysia that it is in  
   mutual interest to enhance economic interaction. India and Malaysia,  
   have excellent cooperation in the area of projects, with several major  
   projects involving Indian companies having been cleared over the last  
   year including a contract for export of gas turbaned equipment by BHEL  
   and another one for hire and maintenance of Indian-made diesel  
   locomotives by IRCON. The volume of India's bilateral trade with  
   Malaysia in 1993-94 was to the tune of US$ 593 million. There are 18  
   Indian joint ventures in Malaysia and another 14 under various stages of  
   implementation, in areas of automobile products, textiles, chemicals,  
   metal, electrical products, palm oil, rubber, turnkey projects,  
   consultancy and insurance. 
<br> 
<br>Malaysian investment in India, which has picked up rapidly since  
   liberalisation, continued to look up with approved investment reaching  
   Rs 830 million in 10 projects. These are in the areas of  
   telecommunication equipment, rubber products, software production,  
   electrical apparatus, shrimp and prawn cultivation. Some other proposals  
   for infrastructural development including highways are under  
   consideration. Under the Memo-randum of Understanding for Defence Cooperation signed by the two  
   countries in 1993, over 100 Malaysian Air Force personnel are currently  
   undergoing training in India.
   <br>-19&gt;
<br> 
<br>During a detailed review of India's bilateral relations with Malaysia  
   undertaken in Chula Lumpur in December 1994, the ways and means to  
   further expand and diversify the relations were discussed and a mutually  
   agreed time table for important bilateral activities like high-level  
   visits, Joint Commission meeting, Foreign Office Consultations, etc was  
   drawn up. 
<br> 
<br>With the Philippines, India's relations have remained cordial and  
   friendly. There is growing realisation on both sides of the untapped  
   potential for economic cooperation to mutual advantage. The Foreign  
   Office Consultations that took place in Manila in November 1994,  
   underlined the need to step up bilateral economic cooperation. A Joint  
   Business Council was set up during the year, which also saw resumption  
   of meat exports from India to the Philippines after a gap of almost  
   thirty years. Senator Leticia Shahani, President Pro-tempore of the  
   Philippines Senate, continued to provide an important link between India  
   and the Philippines. She visited India twice during the year. 
<br> 
<br>India's relations with Brunei Darussalam are also gathering momentum. In  
   keeping with Brunei's interest in enhancing aviation links with India,  
   Brunei's Minister of Communications Dato Haji Zakaria visited India from  
   9 to 12 January 1995 at the invitation of the Indian Civil Aviation  
   Minister. During the visit, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to  
   discuss matters relating to the conclusion of an Air Services Agreement  
   and introduction of scheduled air services between the two countries.  
   The two sides also finalised the text of the Air Services Agreement,  
   which was initialled by Leaders of the two delegations. 
   <br>-19&gt;
<br> 
<br>With Cambodia, India continues to enjoy close and cordial relations.  
   India wishes to see peace and tranquillity prevail in that country.  
   Former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom  
   Sirivuddh, visited India in June 1994. During the visit, he called on  
   the President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister and held  
   discussions with Minister of State for External Affairs Shri R L Bhatia.  
   A Memorandum of Under-standing on Foreign Office Consultations was signed during the visit.  
   India remains interested in resuming the restoration work on Angkor Vat  
   temples. It was also decided to establish a centre for artificial limbs  
   in Cambodia.
   <br>-20&gt;
<br> 
<br>The Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad visited India in August 1994  
   during which a Memorandum of Understanding on Technical Cooperation and  
   a Cultural Agreement were signed. The visit imparted a much-needed  
   impetus to the bilateral relations. Several proposals for enhancing  
   economic and trade relations are under consideration. A line of credit  
   to facilitate expansion of bilateral trade is also under consideration. 
<br> 
<br>Relations between India and Australia continued to be cordial. Vice  
   President Shri K R Narayanan visited Australia in April 1994. He  
   inaugurated the Festival "India Today 1994"-a two-month long diversified  
   programme of events featuring the arts, music, culture-organised by the  
   Australia-India Council. The Vice President met the Governor-General,  
   the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Australia, besides a  
   large number of State level dignitaries and eminent personalities. 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral consultations at Secretary level were held in Canberra on 2  
   and 3 February 1994. Secretary (East) led the Indian side. There were  
   extensive discussions on important international and bilateral issues.  
   Jim Kennon, former Deputy Premier of Victoria, Australia visited India  
   in February 1994. He met senior government officials and business  
   leaders, to identify specific areas for expanding trade and investment.  
   As part of the ongoing exchanges between the defence establishments, the  
   Australian Chief of Defence Forces Admiral A Beaumont visited India from  
   13 to 17 April 1994. 
<br> 
<br>On the economic front, India-Australia relations are expanding rapidly.  
   At the Secretary level consultations in February 1994, the Australian  
   side have shown a keen interest in expanding trade and investment. A  
   comprehensive study on Indian Trade and Investment conducted by the  
   Australian Foreign Office indicated attractive prospects with the Indian  
   economy showing 6% annual growth. Several business/trade delegations  
   from Australia visited India during the year under report. 
<br>-21&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The third meeting of the India-Australia joint Ministerial Commission  
   was held on 4 February 1994 in Sydney. The Indian delegation was led by  
   Shri Kamaluddin Ahmed, Minister of State for Commerce while the  
   Australian delegation was led by Bob McMullan, Minister for Overseas  
   Trade. A business cum investment seminar was organised in Sydney on 18  
   April 1994, followed by the India-Australia Joint Business Council's  
   meeting on 20 and 21 April 1994 in Perth. 
<br> 
<br>The bilateral trade during 1993-94 was Rs 2855.08 crore with adverse  
   balance of trade for India. Australian investment in India has been  
   rising steadily. From January to September 1994 it is Rs 385 crore,  
   fourth largest after USA, Germany and NRIs. 
<br> 
<br>An Honorary Consul General of India was appointed in Melbourne in  
   November 1994. 
<br> 
<br>The traditional friendly relations between India and New Zealand were  
   maintained. Bilateral consultations at Secretary level were held on 22  
   and 23 April 1994 in Wellington. The Indian side was represented by Shri  
   Salman Haider, Secretary (East) and the New Zealand side by Graham  
   Fortune, Acting Secretary. 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral trade registered an increase of 20% in 1993-94 to Rs 342  
   crore. About 12 joint ventures in various fields have been launched. The  
   fourth meeting of the Indo-New Zealand Joint Business Council was held

   like trade and investment expansion, prospects for cooperation through  
   joint ventures and technology transfer. 
<br> 
<br>The fourth meeting of the India-New Zealand Joint Trade Committee was  
   held in Wellington from 22 to 29 June 1994. The India-New Zealand Joint  
   Business Council sent a seven-member consultants team to India in May  
   1994 to discuss prospects and joint ventures with Indian companies  
   involving transfer of technology. 
<br> 
<br>The Government of India has been closely following the developments in  
   Fiji. Addressing the opening session of the newly constituted Fijian  
   Parliament on 21 March 1994, President Mara said that the Fiji  
   Government's two most important foreign policy objectives were (i) to seek resumption of full diplomatic relations with  
   India and (ii) to seek Fiji's re-entry into the Commonwealth.
   <br>-22&gt;
<br> 
<br>Government of India have declared that the Fijian Government should  
   accelerate the review process of the racially-biased 1990 constitution,  
   with a view to achieving an early solution acceptable to all the  
   sections of the Fijian population. Once that is achieved, other issues  
   would not pose any problems. 
<br> 
<br>India has decided to establish diplomatic and consular relations with  
   Federated States of Micronesia, a UN member. Ambassador of India in  
   Tokyo will be concurrently accredited to Micronesia. Efforts were made  
   to strengthen and maintain India's cordial relations with other Pacific  
   Island countries during the year.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>India-China relations in 1994-95 continued to improve steadily and to  
   expand into new areas of cooperation. The Government continued to work  
   for the establishment of a long-term, stable and good neighbourly  
   relationship with China. The momentum of high level political dialogue  
   was maintained in 1994 to expand cooperation and create a favourable  
   climate in which the two countries can work for the resolution of  
   outstanding issues. 
<br> 
<br>Political contact between India and China continued through high level  
   exchanges and regular consultations at other levels. 
<br> 
<br>Among the high level political exchanges between the two countries, the  
   Chinese Foreign, Defence, Foreign Trade and Supervision Ministers  
   visited India. From India, the Ministers of Agriculture, Human Resource  
   Development and Health &amp; Family Welfare visited China. The Ministers of  
   State for Coal, Petroleum, Labour and the Deputy Minister for Culture  
   also visited China. Vice President of India Shri K R Narayanan visited  
   China from 22 to 28 October 1994. 
<br> 
<br>The situation along the India-China border remained peaceful during the  
   year. The seventh meeting of the India-China joint Working Group (JWG)  
   was held in Beijing in July 1994. The JWG continued discussions aimed at  
   arriving at a fair, reason-able and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question and on  
   the implementation of the Border Peace and Tranquillity Agreement. The  
   India-China Expert Group (EG), set up under the Border Peace and  
   Tranquillity Agreement to assist the JWG in the implementation of the  
   Agreement, held two meetings in February and April 1994. These meetings  
   of the EG resulted in basic agreement on issues relating to the Group's  
   mandate, future tasks and methodology codified into a document on the  
   work regulations of the EG which was signed by the leaders of the two  
   delegations at the second meeting of the EG. The two countries also  
   agreed in principle to open more points for border trade. Border trade  
   through Shipkila in Himachal Pradesh started on 16 July 1994. An  
   agreement to open Shipkila for border trade had been signed during the  
   Prime Minister's visit to China in 1993.
   <br>-24&gt;
<br> 
<br>The two countries also succeeded in their efforts to enhance the  
   economic content of their relations. In the first nine months of 1994  
   the total volume of bilateral trade was US$ 593 million, an increase of  
   29.5% over the corresponding period last year. The potential for a  
   future increase in this trade, given the size and strength of the Indian  
   and the Chinese economies, remains vast. During the fifth meeting of the  
   India-China Joint Group on Economic, Trade and Scientific and  
   Technological Cooperation held in June 1994, India's Commerce Minister  
   and the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Mme  
   Wu Yi called for greater efforts by all concerned to realise the trade  
   and economic potential that exists between two such large economies. The  
   Vice President during his visit to China in October 1994, emphasised the  
   need to further increase cooperation in economic and scientific- 
   technological fields. Agreements signed in the field of banking and  
   avoidance of double taxation are likely to facilitate the further growth  
   of trade and economic links between the two countries-The year also saw  
   continued efforts to expand cooperation to new areas based on the logic  
   of mutual benefit. Coal, petroleum, medicine, civil aviation, banking  
   and the labour laws are some of the new areas in which the two countries  
   have initiated cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>The year 1994 saw the Festival of India in China during the months of  
   May and June. This was the first ever ' festival of a foreign nation to  
   be held in China. The two countries also celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Panchsheel or the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence. During the seminar which was inaugurated by the  
   Prime Minister on 27 June 1994, participants from both India and China  
   discussed the relevance of Panchsheel in the post-Cold War era.

   1992. The two countries have institutionalised bilateral consultations.  
   Foreign Secretary level talks are held annually; and the recent meeting  
   was held in Tokyo in September 1994 when important bilateral and other  
   issues were discussed. Shozo Azuma, Parliamentary Vice Minister for  
   Foreign Affairs of Japan visited India in January 1994 and discussed

   to grow during the year under report. Japan has maintained its position  
   as the largest bilateral donor of development assistance to India. Japan  
   has pledged 125,765 million yen (approximately equivalent to Rs 3,920  
   crore) as ODA to India for 1994-95, a five per cent increase over the  
   previous year. This year's ODA loan package comprises twelve projects  
   covering power, transport, drinking water and sewage system, environment  
   and afforestation sectors. Japan continued its grant-in-aid for small  
   scale, health, education and social welfare projects and technical  
   training.

   in November 1994. The desire of Indian private and public sector  
   enterprises to associate themselves with joint venture projects in  
   Mongolia in the small scale sector as well as for infrastructural  
   development was reaffirmed. The opening of chartered flights to Mongolia  
   from India during 1994 is expected to contribute to the growth of  
   bilateral trade.

<tr><td>India is actively engaged in promoting her relations with Central  
   Asian countries as well as with Azerbaijan and Turkey. India's relations  
   with these countries have been historically friendly and the Central  
   Asian leaders are especially keen for this relationship to grow as  
   rapidly as possible. These newly independent countries are going through  
   a process of external and internal adjustment with a view to integrating  
   themselves in the international community following the dissolution of  
   the Soviet Union; India has offered training facilities to the nationals  
   of these newly independent countries. Some of these countries, such as  
   Tajikistan, also face the twin threats of fundamentalism and terrorism,  
   including cross-border terrorism. Apart from maintaining a steady  
   dialogue with the above mentioned countries at the UN and other  
   international fora, India has opened resident diplomatic missions in  
   Bishkek (the Kyrghyz Republic), Dushanbe (Tajikistan) and Ashgabat  
   (Turkmenistan); with these Missions, India has resident diplomatic  
   representation in all Central Asian capitals except Baku (Azerbaijan).  
   The Consulate General of India has been opened in Istanbul in Turkey and  
   India's Ambassador in Ankara is concurrently accredited to Azerbaijan.

<br>Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Salman Khurshid visited  
   Kazakhstan leading a delegation of senior officials and businessmen  
   where he had detailed discussions with the Kazakh leadership on  
   international issues as well as on ways to inten-sify bilateral relations. The Director of the Indian Cultural Centre with the Embassy of India, Almaty, was in position in May 1994. This was  
   in fulfilment of Prime Minister's announcement in 1993 for setting up an  
   Indian Cultural Centre in Almaty to cater to the deep Kazakh interest in  
   Indian culture. In August 1994, the new Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan,  
   Kanat B Saudabaev transited through New Delhi and had detailed  
   discussions with Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri R L  
   Bhatia. A delegation of the Ministry of External Affairs participated in

   leading a delegation of Indian officials and businessmen; during his  
   stay he had discussions with the Kyrghyz leaders who welcomed greater  
   Indian presence in Central Asia. The credit line of US$ 5 million is  
   under active negotiation and will be finalised shortly. 
<br>-31&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India's relations with Tajikistan also received considerable stimulus  
   with the visit, the first ever by an Indian leader after the  
   independence of Tajikistan, of Minister of State for External Affairs,  
   Shri Salman Khurshid in June 1994, who led a delegation of senior

    The global importance of the Gulf region stems from the fact that the  
   area holds over half of the world's proven oil reserves. During the past  
   two decades, many of the Gulf countries have attained unprecedented  
   economic prosperity from their oil revenues. Further, Islam originated  
   in this region and two of the holiest Islamic shrines of Makkah and  
   Madinah lie in Saudi Arabia, giving the country a special place in the  
   Islamic world. 
<br> 
<br>Historically, India and the neighbouring region of the Gulf have had a  
   close interaction based on trade routes and Islam. In recent times,  
   these ties have acquired a significant socio-economic dimension.  
   Currently, India imports nearly two-thirds of her oil from this region.  
   India's trade with the Gulf countries stood at over Rs 20,206 crore in  
   1993-94 (Indian Exports: Rs 6,260 crore; Indian Imports: Rs 13,946  
   crore). During this year the total value of Indo-Gulf trade grew by 23%.  
   The ongoing economic liberalisation has facilitated expansion and  
   diversification in bilateral trade with the Gulf countries. 
<br> 
<br>Over 20 lakh Indian nationals are estimated to be living in these  
   countries most of whom are gainfully employed. The inward annual  
   remittances from these Indians through banking channels are currently  
   estimated to be Rs 7,800 crore. 
<br>-35&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The Gulf region is one of the large markets for the Indian exports.  
   Although Indian exports to the Gulf have risen significantly in recent  
   years, India still has a large trade deficit with this region. India has  
   the advantage of proximity and cheap labour which together can make the  
   country an ideal source for light consumer items, perishables,  
   handicrafts, etc required by the countries of this region. 
<br> 
<br>Tranquillity in the Gulf region is imperative to Indian interests. India  
   has, therefore, consistently called for peace, stability and security in  
   this region. India has urged respect for independence, sovereignty and  
   territorial integrity of all the Gulf States. India is willing to  
   contribute to all sincere endeavours to secure and stabilise the region. 
<br> 
<br>It has been India's endeavour to harness geographical proximity, social  
   familiarity and economic complementarity between India and the Gulf  
   region to mutual advantage. To this end, creation of bilateral economic  
   linkages remains a priority. 
<br> 
<br>Even as there have been no serious bilateral problems or difference of  
   views between India and Gulf states, India has remained keen to promote  
   bilateral understanding. To this end, India took a number of initiatives  
   for dialogue and exchange visits. A pattern of bilateral Foreign Office  
   consultations at Secretary level with the Gulf countries has become a  
   regular feature of Indian diplomacy. During the year, such consultations  
   were held with Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE  
   and Yemen. 
<br> 
<br>In the recent times, India's bilateral relations with all the Gulf  
   countries have been marked by growing mutually beneficial co operation  
   and cordiality. The year 1994-95 saw further development in this  
   direction. 
<br> 
<br>During the year, Indo-Bahraini relations continued to develop in various  
   fields. A 22-member delegation of Bahrain Chambers of Commerce and  
   Industries visited India in April and signed an agreement with FICCI for  
   setting up a joint Business Council. In December, a nine-member  
   delegation of Majlis al-Shoura of Bahrain visited India at the joint  
   invitation of the Chairman of Rajya Sabha and the Speaker of Lok Sabha. Shri Salman Haider,  
   Secretary (East) in the Ministry visited Bahrain in September this. year  
   as part of annual Foreign Office talks. 
   <br>-36&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Even as India's relations with Iraq have remained restricted by the UN  
   economic sanctions on that country, there was gradual upgradation in  
   bilateral contacts. India has consistently advocated phased lifting of  
   the UN economic sanctions in tandem with Iraqi compliance with the terms  
   of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Iraqi Foreign Minister  
   Mohamed Saeed al-Shhaf visited India from 21 to 23 April as Iraqi ,  
   President's Special Envoy. He called on the President, the Prime  
   Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. A six-member Iraqi  
   Economic Delegation led by the Permanent Under Secretary for  
   Communications Jamil Ibrahim Ali al-Saleh paid an official visit to  
   India in November. Pending bilateral economic issues were discussed  
   during the visit. 
<br> 
<br>During the year, Indo-Kuwait relations continued to be on the upswing.  
   On a number of occasions, India reiterated her commitment to Kuwaiti  
   independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Minister of  
   Communication, Electricity and Water of Kuwait Jassem Mohammed al-Oun  
   visited India from 5 to 9 December. During the visit he held extensive  
   talks with the Ministers of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and Power and  
   the Minister of State for Communications on ways to strengthen bilateral  
   cooperation. A 15-member Kuwaiti Multi-Disciplinary Economic delegation  
   led by the Under Secretary of Finance Abdul Mohsin al-Hunaif paid an  
   official visit to India from 11 to 16 April. The visit was aimed at  
   exploring possibilities of boosting bilateral economic cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>Kuwaiti Oil Minister Dr Abdul Mohsen Medej al-Medej paid an official  
   visit to India from 11 to 14 January 1995 to hold extensive talks for  
   future bilateral cooperation in oil sector with his counterpart, Captain

   visit, he called on President and met Finance Minister, Minister for  
   Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers as well as Minister of State for External  
   Affairs. 
<br>-37&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The momentum generated by the Prime Minister's landmark visit to Oman in  
   June 1993, saw further progress during the year reflected in intense  
   exchange of views and Ministerial-level visits. The Minister of  
   Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav paid an official  
   visit to Oman from 28 to 30 July . He and the Omani Minister of

   issues. An Indo-Omani Agreement setting Principal Conditions of the  
   long-term gas supply contract for the import of Omani natural gas  
   through a pipeline across the Arabian Sea was signed in Muscat, Oman on

<br>The Special Kuwait Cell handled a total of 1,44,496 claims for an  
   asserted value of approximately US$ 3.6 billion. These comprised  
   1,04,035 'A' claims, 258 'B' claims, 39,158 'C' claims, 927 'D' claims,  
   117 'E' claims and 1 'F' claim. The deadline prescribed by the United

   dates for submission of corporate claims and Government claims remained  
   as 1 July 1994 and 1 August 1994 respectively. Late claims continued to  
   be sent to the UNCC on a weekly basis. 
<br> 
<br>It has been gathered from the UNCC that payment for some Indian 'A'  
   claims may come through not earlier than March/May 1995. There is a  
   possibility that this payment may even be further deferred till the end  
   of 1995. All approved Indian 'B' claims are, however, likely to be paid  
   out by 1995. 'C' claims will be taken up for approval in the second  
   instalment of this category. Upon receipt of payments from the UNCC,

<br>India's relations with the PLO continue to be marked by cordiality,  
   close understanding and a complementarity of views. India has been a  
   consistent supporter for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian  
   people. India 'welcomed the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo on 4  
   May 1994, which set up the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and put  
   into process the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho. An  
   Indian delegation led by the Minister of State for External Affairs,  
   Shri R L Bhatia was present during the signing ceremony. The Government  
   of India welcomed the role played by PNA in the reconstruction of Gaza  
   and Jericho. India has been a strong supporter of the Middle East Peace  
   Process (MEPP) and with that conviction, she has enthusiastically  
   participated in the Meetings of all Working Groups of the MEPP set up to  
   examine a range of issues that affect the prospects for peace in the  
   region. India has been committed to alleviating the plight of  
   Palestinian refugees by extending moral, material and technical  
   assistance to the Palestinian people. India has regularly contributed to  
   the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) budget. The  
   Government of India, in response to the appeal made by the Working Group  
   on Refugees, has also offered to train 15 para-medical staff from Gaza  
   and Jericho. Palestinian students will continue to be provided  
   scholarships to pursue their studies in India. As part of India's  
   commitment to the economic re-construcion of Gaza and Jericho, the  
   Government of India has proposed to send a team to conduct feasibility  
   studies for setting up, under Indian technical assistance programme, a  
   Hi-Tech Centre on Computers and Electronics that will train Palestinian  
   youth and help address the unemployment problem of Gaza and Jericho. In  
   accordance with India's commitment made at the Washington Donors  
   Confernce in October 1993 it has also been decided to send 100 metric  
   tonnes of tea to Gaza and Jericho. The Indian Council for Cultural  
   Relations organised a function to commemorate the International Day of  
   Solidarity with the Palestinian people in New Delhi on 13 December 1994. 
<br> 
<br>India sent medicines and seeds worth Rs 10 lakh to Somalia for  
   distribution by the Indian military contingent deployed with UNOSOM-II  
   in that country. The Indian contingent did a commendable job in Somalia,  
   despite heavy odds, particularly in providing humanitarian assistance.  
   The performance of the Indian peace keeping contingent was acknowledged by the UN, the various  
   factions in Somalia, NGOs working for humanitarian relief and the people  
   of Somalia. Pursuant to the decision to withdraw the Indian contingent  
   from Somalia, the last batch of Indian troops left Somalia by end  
   December 1994.

<br> 
<br>Relations between India and Sudan continued to improve during the period  
   under report. Both sides have sought to widen the scope of their  
   bilateral cooperation and re-establish their multi-dimensional links.  
   Omar Yousif Barido, First Under Secretary of the Sudanese Ministry of  
   Foreign Affairs Visited India in April 1994 to discuss various issues of  
   mutual concern. It was also decided to increase the share of Sudan in  
   the ITEC programme. An Agreement to set up a joint Committee at the  
   Secretary-level was signed during the visit of Shri Salman Haider,  
   Secretary (East) to Sudan in January 1995. 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral relations with Syria continued to get warmer. Syria evinced  
   keen interest in sending students to Indian institutions of higher  
   learning in the field of science and technology. Syria also showed  
   interest in basic chemicals and fertilisers. The Minister of  
   Agriculture, Shri Balram Jakhar visited Syria from 18 to 20 June 1994. A  
   Programme of Cooperation in the field of agriculture and allied sectors  
   was signed between the two sides. This Programme of Cooperation will be  
   valid for a period of 5 years. Shri K Srinivasan, Foreign Secretary  
   visited Syria from 23 to 25 August 1994 for bilateral discussions. He  
   met the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Farouk Al Shara. 
<br> 
<br>The 7th session of the Indo-Tunisian Joint Commission took place in New  
   Delhi in September 1994 with the Tunisian delegation being led by Sadok  
   Rabah, the Minister of National Economy. A Commercial Agreement was  
   signed between the two sides. India and Tunisia have exchanged draft  
   treaties on extradition. Formal signing of the agreement is expected in  
   the near future. 
<br> 
<br>India maintained traditionally close relations with the League of Arab  
   States. India values the efforts made by the League to develop and  
   strengthen friendship between India and the Arab countries. The Minister  
   of External Affairs, Shri Dinesh Singh has extended an invitation to Dr Esmat Adel Meguid, the League's Secretary General to visit India in 1995.
   <br>-46&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India made sincere attempts to persuade the Organisation of Islamic  
   Conference to adopt objective and unbiased views on India-specific  
   issues. The Seventh Extra Ordinary Islamic Foreign Ministers Conference  
   held in Islamabad in September passed a resolution for establishing an  
   OIC Contact Group on Kashmir at the UN. Giving India's official  
   response, External Affairs Minister Shri Dinesh Singh regretted the  
   resolution and reiterated India's offer of a dialogue with Pakistan  
   under the Simla Agreement. Subsequent attempts by the OIC Contact Group  
   to table an India-specific draft resolution in the First Committee of  
   the UNGA had to be given up due to lack of support from the member  
   countries themselves following India's extensive demarches to the  
   concerned countries to explain her position in this regard. While the  
   Seventh Islamic Summit held in Casablanca (Morocco) on 14 and 15  
   December passed the customary resolution on Jammu and Kashmir dispute,  
   there was a pronounced shift away at the Summit from the bilateral  
   disputes.

<tr><td>Africa was witness to a number of significant political events during  
   1994. India enjoys warm relations with the countries in Africa. India  
   has always attached special significance to her relations with Africa,  
   and is continuing to build a strong economic relationship with countries  
   there. In 1994 India continued to have close interaction with them. 
<br> 
<br>In the first multi-party elections, based on universal franchise, the  
   people of South Africa voted the African National Congress (ANC) to  
   majority in the Parliament. However, ANC leader Nelson Mandela proved  
   his farsightedness and statesmanship by choosing to form a government of  
   national reconciliation. In Mozambique, after decades of civil war, the  
   ruling Frelimo Party and the main opposition Renamo signed a Peace  
   Accord in 1992 and participated in the country's first multi-party  
   elections in October 1994 under UN supervision. Frelimo, Party leader,  
   Joaquin Chissano was re-elected as President. Dr Sam Nujoma was re- 
   elected President of Namibia. India welcomed these developments. 
<br> 
<br>India has expressed her readiness to develop., mutually beneficial  
   relationships with the new governments in the political, economic,  
   commercial, technological and educational fields. India is ready to  
   cooperate with these countries in such areas as human resource development, small scale industries, agriculture, etc.  
   India also extended humanitarian and relief assistance to a number of  
   countries including Rwanda.
   <br>-48&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Africa continues to be a major thrust area under the Indian Technical  
   and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and Special Commonwealth African  
   Assistance Programme (SCAAP), the two technital assistance programmes  
   which are executed by the Ministry of External Affairs. Out of a total  
   of 1350 slots allocated for training in Indian civilian institutions  
   under ITEC for 1994-95, 768 (more than 50%) were reserved for countries  
   in Africa. Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania and Mauritius  
   were among those which were allotted the maximum number of slots. Among  
   the preferred areas for training are small scale industries, tools  
   design, rural development, diplomacy, textile research, standardisation,  
   banking and finance, management, etc. A total of 28 Indian experts are  
   also in station in various African countries as of December 1994. The  
   areas of specialisation of the experts include small scale industries,  
   engineering, medicines, taxation, etc. Out of the 250 slots offered to  
   nominees from friendly developing countries for training in Indian  
   defence establishments under the ITEC Programme, more than 150 were  
   allotted to countries from the African continent. 
<br> 
<br>From Western Africa Pere were the State visits of Presidents of Burkina  
   Faso and Togo. Presidents of Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Senegal and  
   Zimbabwe too visited India, some in connection with the G-15 Summit. The  
   Vice President of Mauritius visited India in January 1995. Several  
   Ministerial-level visits were also exchanged with a number of countries. 
<br> 
<br>Africa continues to suffer from a serious socio-economic crisis.  
   Poverty, hunger, AIDS, high internal indebtedness, balance of payment  
   crises resulting from falling prices of primary products, have  
   undermined the ability of African countries to face economic challenges.  
   But the changed political scenario in Southern Africa, the integration  
   of South African and Namibian economies in the region, the entry of  
   South Africa into Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), the  
   revival of the Eastern Africa Community among Kenya, Tanzania and  
   Uganda, and greater cooperation among countries of the southern and eastern regions are positive developments and could be expected to play  
   a vital role in the economic regeneration and development of Africa.

<br>With the election of a democratic, non-racial Government in I South  
   Africa, the Government of India established an Indian Embassy in  
   Pretoria in May 1994 and the Indian Cultural Centre in Johannesburg was  
   converted into a Consulate General. The Embassy was redesignated as High

   Kwazulu/Natal Province which is the home of about 0.8 million South  
   African Indians, India established a Consulate General at Durban on 16  
   May 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Indexpo '94, the largest single country trade exhibition ever organised  
   in South Africa was held in Johannesburg in August 1994. The Exhibition

<tr class="evenRow"><td>The working visit of Finance and Communication Minister of Seychelles,  
   James Michel in January 1994 has raised hopes of improved trade  
   relations between India and Seychelles. The main impediment in the  
   expansion of trade continues to be the absence of regular shipping  
   services between the two countries. Two Indian naval ships-INS Gomati  
   and INS Khukri-paid a goodwill visit to Port Victoria from 23 to 26  
   November 1994. However, Government of India expressed its strong  
   disapproval of the way the Seychelles authorities refused disembarkation  
   of passengers from an Air India flight that had made an emergency  
   landing in November in an unsuccessful bid to save an infant passenger's  
   life. Several visits of business delegations from India and proposals  
   for establishment of some industrial projects with Indian assistance are  
   under active consideration. India deputed seven experts to Seychelles  
   under the ITEC Programme during the year. Seychelles also utilised two  
   civilian training slots under this programme.

<br> 
<br>Following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda in an air  
   crash on 6 April 1994 and the outbreak of ethnic violence in that  
   country, all the Indians there (300 in number-except two nuns who were  
   unwilling to abandon a large number of Rwandan orphans in their charge- 
   migrated from Rwanda. The Indian High Commission in Kampala, which is  
   concurrently accredited to Rwanda, managed to get the members of the  
   Indian community evacuated safely to the neighbouring country, Burundi  
   and elsewhere with the assistance of other friendly countries. The  
   Indian High Commissions in Kampala and Nairobi provided consular  
   services to the evacuees. The Indian Association in Burundi, with which  
   Indian High Commission in Kampala maintained close contacts, rendered  
   necessary assistance to the Indian evacuees who first went to Burundi  
   from Rwanda. The High Commission of India, Kampala has remained in  
   constant touch with the Indian community in Burundi with a view to  
   monitoring their security and other interests. There were no reports of  
   any casualties among Indian families in the course of ethnic violence in  
   Rwanda. India supplied relief materials worth Rs 5 lakh to Rwandese  
   refugees in Tanzania. An Indian army battalion to United Nations Aid  
   Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) reached Kigali on 10 November 1994. Rwanda  
   has shown interest in increasing and strengthening economic and  
   technical cooperation with India.

<br>The traditionally close and friendly relations between Mauritius and  
   India have grown further. Vice President Shri K R Narayanan, leading a  
   high-level delegation, visited Mauritius for one day on the way back  
   from South Africa in May this year. Other Ministerial visits included  
   those of the Mauritian Finance Minister Sithanen, External Affairs Minister Dr Kasenally and  
   that of Labour Party Leader, Navin Ramgoolam. Mauritian Vice President  
   Sir Rabindranath Ghurburrun and Lady Ghurburrun visited India in January  
   1995. Bilateral trade has increased by almost 30 per cent this year. A  
   number of new joint ventures in different fields were established.  
   Mauritius has emerged as the main centre for channelising investments  
   into India through off-shore funds as a result of the advantageous  
   provisions of the treaty for Avoidance of Double Taxation. Twenty-nine  
   civilian training slots were utilised by Mauritius under the ITEC  
   Programme during the year. Seven ITEC experts were also deputed from  
   India to Mauritius during the same period.
   <br>-52&gt;
<br> 
<br>Indo-Kenyan relations continued to be warm and friendly, characterised  
   by mutual regard. President Moi stopped over in Delhi on his way to  
   Beijing in May 1994. India donated 476 metric tonnes of rice to Kenya  
   for distribution to persons in drought-affected areas. A Cultural

<br>The political stability and economic recovery achieved under the  
   leadership of President Museveni of Uganda continue to be maintained  
   during the current year. India's relations with Uganda witnessed  
   positive developments during this period. President Museveni led a high- 
   powered trade and investment delegation to India in September 1994. In  
   December, Ugandan Minister of Education and Sports visited India. There  
   have been several visits of business delegations from India and  
   proposals for establishment of some industrial projects with Indian  
   assistance are under active consideration. 
<br> 
<br>General Gnassingbe Eyadema, President of Togo paid a State visit to  
   India from 26 to 29 September 1994. Being the first visit by a President of Togo, this opened a new chapter in mutual relations  and added an impetus to bilateral cooperation between the two countries. India also announced a grant of Rs 10 crore approximately for setting up  
   of an agricultural project in Togo and agreed to cooperate in the fields  
   of city transportation, health care, scientific research, trade,  
   industry and agriculture. India and Togo also decided to set up a Joint

<tr><td>Eastern Europe 
<br> 
<br>There was considerable interaction between India and the countries of  
   the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as Central and Eastern  
   Europe during 1994-95. With practically all these countries, India has  
   had longstanding relations of friendship and cooperation based on trust  
   and confidence. The evolution of these countries in the direction of  
   democratic pluralism and market-oriented economic structures has brought  
   them closer to India in terms of basic orientation. While integration  
   with West European political, security and economic structures remains  
   their first priority, there is also acknowledgement of the importance of  
   preserving and strengthening their traditionally close relations with  
   important Asian countries, particularly India. 
<br> 
<br>An additional factor has been the emergence of India as a potential  
   large market and attractive destination for foreign investment in recent  
   years. India has established a mutually beneficial economic and  
   commercial interaction with all the countries in East Europe. In many  
   cases, institutional mechanisms like Inter-Government Joint Commissions  
   and Joint Business Councils, as well as framework agreements  
   establishing the legal basis of cooperation in various spheres are  
   already in place. 
<br> 
<br>It has been India's endeavour, in her approach towards these countries,  
   to blend continuity with change, retaining and building upon those  
   elements of the traditional relationship which continue to be relevant while making adjustments as necessary in the  
   light of the changes which have taken place in these countries as well  
   as in India. Thus, direct contacts between the Indian Parliament and the  
   parliamentary systems in many of these countries is emerging as an  
   important new dimension in the bilateral relationships. In the economic  
   and commercial sphere, old patterns of State trading and special trading  
   arrangements are giving way to new relationships based on international  
   and technological competitiveness. The challenges posed to India's  
   bilateral relations by the transition processes in this region are being  
   met and the new opportunities which have arisen are increasingly being  
   utilised.
   <br>-55&gt;
<br> 
<br>During the year, there were seven exchanges of visits at the Head of  
   State or Head of Government level. The President paid State visits to  
   Bulgaria and Romania, while the Prime Minister paid an official visit to  
   the Russian Federation. The Presidents of the Czech Republic and Poland  
   paid State visits and the Prime Ministers of the Slovak Republic and the  
   Russian Federation paid official visits to India. Parliamentary  
   delegations from Bulgaria, the Russian Federation and Hungary visited  
   India. 
<br> 
<br>India's relations with the Russian Federation are friendly and  
   multifaceted, encompassing political consultation on matters of mutual  
   interest, significant economic and commercial interaction and  
   cooperation in such areas as science and technology, defence, atomic  
   energy, space, culture and education. The two countries are keen to  
   preserve the positive elements of their traditional cooperation and to  
   take advantage of the new opportunities provided by the changes in both  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>The Prime Minister, Shri P V Narasimha Rao visited Russia from 29 June  
   to 2 July 1994. He was accompanied by the Commerce Minister, the  
   Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism, the Minister of State in the  
   Prime Minister's Office, the Minister of State for External Affairs Shri  
   R L Bhatia and senior officers. The Prime Minister had a tete-a-tete  
   meeting with President Yeltsin and separate delegation level talks with  
   President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Deputy Prime Minister  
   Yarov and Culture Minister Sidorov called on the, Prime Minister.  
   Several other meetings took place between the Ministers accom- panying the Prime Minister and their counterparts: Commerce Minister met  
   Deputy Prime Minister Yarov, who is also the Co-chairman of the Indo- 
   Russian joint Commission, as well as the acting Finance Minister and the  
   Minister for Economic Relations; Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism  
   met the First Deputy Minister of Transport; and the Minister of State in  
   the Prime Minister's Office met the Chairman of the Russian Academy of  
   Sciences and the Chairman of the Indo-Russian Working Group on Science  
   and Technology. Minister of State for External Affairs had talks with  
   the Russian Foreign Minister and the First Deputy Foreign Minister. The  
   Prime Minister addressed a representative group of Parliamentarians from  
   both Houses of the Russian Parliament.
   <br>-56&gt;
<br> 
<br>Beyond reciprocating the visit by President Yeltsin to India in January  
   1993, this visit ushered in a qualitatively new stage of Indo-Russian  
   relations. The Moscow Declaration on the Protection of the interests of  
   Pluralist States sets out the post-Cold War challenges posed to the  
   viability of large, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and  
   multi-religious States by the forces of aggressive nationalism,  
   religious and political extremism, terrorism and separatism and the need  
   to combat these challenges through democracy, tolerance, secularism and  
   the rule of law. It is recognised as a unique document in international  
   relations and has subsequently been circulated as a UN Document at the  
   joint initiative of India and Russia. 
<br> 
<br>The Declaration on Further Development and Intensification of Bilateral  
   Cooperation underlines the broad identity of views of the two countries  
   on important regional and international issues, and identifies priority  
   areas and directions of cooperation between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>In addition, Agreements and Protocols were signed on cooperation in  
   tourism, environment, space, science and technology, standardisation and  
   metallurgy. The 1992 Agreement on defence credit was extended for a  
   further period of two years and an agreement on setting up of a joint  
   venture in military aviation was signed. 
<br> 
<br>The first meeting of the co-chairmen of the Inter-Governmental Joint  
   Commission, Commerce Minister, Shri Pranab Mukherjee and Deputy Prime Minister Yuri F Yarov was held in Delhi in June 1994.  
   Priority areas of cooperation were identified and the Joint Commission  
   held its first meeting in Moscow on 13 and 14 September 1994, after the  
   Working Groups had held their separate meetings.
   <br>-57&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Accordingly the nine Working Groups-on Trade and Economic Cooperation;  
   Power and Non-Conventional Sources of Energy; Petroleum; Ferrous and  
   Non-Ferrous Metallurgy; Science and Technology; Culture; Coal;  
   Information Technology; and Environment-held meetings and identified  
   their respective areas of cooperation. In addition, two Sub-Groups on  
   Transport as well as Health were established. 
<br>

<tr class="evenRow"><td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#000000">The process of continuing change in post-Cold War Europe and in India's  
   own external environment has created a new context for relations between  
   India and the countries of Western Europe, providing an impetus for  
   intensification of relations based on complementarity of interests and  
   mutual benefit. India's historical and cultural interaction with Europe  
   also provides a unique dimension that further serves to strengthen  
   mutual understanding and affinities. Over a million persons of Indian  
   origin live in Western Europe, a tenth of them Indian citizens. 
<br> 
<br>During the year, progress towards European integration continued and  
   Sweden, Finland and Austria joined the European Union (EU) which now  
   comprises 15 countries. India's political dialogue with the countries of  
   the European Union, both individually and collectively, assumed added  
   importance with the emergence of the EU as an influential political  
   entity and the consolidation of a common EU foreign and security policy.  
   Sustained efforts were made to strengthen understanding on issues of  
   vital concern to India, both regional and global. Shared com- mitment to democratic values, secularism and individual freedoms under  
   the rule of law provided a strong foundation for constructive relations  
   and dialogue between India and the EU.
   <br>-64&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Both the European Commission and individual members of the European  
   Union evolved new strategies to strengthen political dialogue and  
   economic relations with Asian countries, including India. This trend was  
   complemented by India's economic reforms and efforts to globalise the  
   Indian economy, providing the basis for an unprecedented increase in  
   India's economic relations with Western Europe. 
<br> 
<br>India's trade with the EU countries increased by 20% over the previous  
   year to reach $ 14.89 billion in 1993; this upward trend continued  
   during 1994. Collectively the largest trading partners of India, the EU  
   countries accounted for 30% of India's exports and imports. Similar  
   progress was registered on the investment front. The share of West  
   European countries in FDI approvals went up from 20% in 1993 to 30% in  
   1994. Germany, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands were among the top 10  
   investing countries in India during 1994. Actual investment inflows from  
   Western Europe since the launching of India's economic reforms in July  
   1991 comprised 31% of total inflows. In terms of actual FDI inflows, the  
   UK, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and France were also among the 10  
   leading investors. West European countries also continued to be a  
   leading source of development assistance, technology collaborations and  
   joint ventures. 
<br> 
<br>In order to be able to respond effectively to the challenges and  
   opportunities arising from the evolution of common approaches of EU  
   countries on foreign and security policies as well as the single EU  
   market, bi-annual meetings of Indian Heads of Missions in Belgium,  
   Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands,. Sweden, Austria and the UK were  
   institutionalised during the year. The meetings resulted in greater  
   political and economic coordination and provided for more effective and  
   concerted actions to promote India's relations with countries of the  
   European Union. 
<br> 
<br>The forward momentum in India's relations with Germany, India's leading  
   economic partner in Europe, was given further impetus through the  
   exchanges of high level visits during the year. Dr Carl-Dieter Spranger,  
   German Minister for Develop-ment Cooperation visited India from 10 to 14 February 1994. The German  
   Minister for Economics, Dr Gunter Rexrodt attended the 11th Session of  
   the Indo-German Joint Commission held in New Delhi on 6 and 7 April  
   1994.
   <br>-65&gt; 
<br> 
<br>An Indian Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha,  
   Shri Shivraj Patil visited Germany from 26 June to 2 July. 1994. The  
   delegation interacted with a wide cross-section of German  
   parliamentarians and leaders of various political parties. 
<br> 
<br>The Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Germany, Dr Klaus Kinkel  
   visited India from 27 to 29 July 1994 accompanied by a high-level  
   business delegation. He underlined the central position occupied by  
   India in terms of Germany's "Asia Concept Policy" and stressed the  
   importance attached by Germany to developing closer relations with India  
   on the basis of partnership in political, economic and cultural fields.  
   Dr Kinkel also reaffirmed Germany's support for the resumption of Indo- 
   Pak bilateral dialogue and welcomed India's policy of transparency on  
   human rights. He indicated Germany's strong interest in permanent  
   membership of the United Nations Security Council and expressed support  
   for a permanent seat for India in that UN body. The German business  
   delegation accompanying Dr Kinkel evinced keen interest in increasing  
   their presence in the Indian market through investments, particularly in  
   the fields of power, chemicals and transportation infrastructure. 
<br> 
<br>The Indo-German Consultative Group, which has emerged as a strong  
   catalytic force in Indo-German relations, held its Third Session in Bonn  
   on 27 and 28 August and submitted recommendations covering bilateral  
   cooperation in political, economic, scientific, cultural and media  
   fields. In the political field, the Group urged India and Germany to  
   reinforce cooperation on global issues at multilateral fora; strengthen  
   bilateral dialogue and regular exchange of assessments on the rapidly  
   changing global situation with reference to new threats and challenges  
   emerging in the post-Cold War scenerio such as intolerance and  
   extremism, terrorism and drug-trafficking; institutionalise meetings of  
   Policy Planning Staff as well as interaction between Research  
   Insitutions and Think Tanks of both countries; con-tinue bilateral dialogue on non-proliferation and strengthen cooperation on disarmament issues.
   <br>-66&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Following up on a decision taken during Prime Minister's visit to  
   Germany from 2 to 5 February 1994, an Indo-German Committee on Science  
   and Technology was constituted during the year to promote and oversee  
   cooperation in this vital field. 
<br>

   first Prime Ministerial visit from India since 1955. The visit marked a  
   new era of relations between the UK and India, reinforcing trends  
   towards a long term partnership based on mutual confidence and trust,  
   shared values and mutual benefit. Prime Minister's interaction with  
   British leaders provided the basis for a broad consensus in the UK on  
   the importance of relations with India. A Bilateral Investment  
   Protection Agreement was concluded with the UK during the visit, the  
   first signed by India with any country, giving a further boost to  
   bilateral economic relations and investments. The Indo-British  
   Partnership Initiative (IBPI), launched in January 1993, was extended  
   for another year. The IBPI achieved major success in promoting awareness  
   of opportunities for trade and investment opened up by India's economic  
   reforms. Indo-British trade, which grew by 24%) during 1993, continued  
   to register a high rate of growth during 1994.

   Offices of countries in Western Europe was further intensified during  
   the year. Foreign Secretary/Secretary level talks were held with the UK,  
   Germany, France, Finland, Italy, Spain and Austria. Dialogue at the  
   official level was also conducted with Ireland, UK, Spain, France,  
   Germany, Austria, Portugal, Norway and the Netherlands. 
<br> 
<br>With a view to expanding the areas of constructive interaction, official  
   level dialogue was also undertaken on drug trafficking and terrorism  
   with France, Germany and the European Commission. 
<br> 
<br>Bilateral talks on disarmament, non-proliferation and international  
   security issues were held during the year with the UK, France and  
   Germany, resulting in a better appreciation of India's policy and  
   concerns in these areas. 
<br> 
<br>On 13 July 1994 the European Commission brought out a paper entitled  
   "Towards a New Asia Strategy", which was considered by the European  
   Council on 28 November 1994. The Council laid down its own approaches  
   and guidelines in a Report on "Asia Strategy of the European Union",  
   calling for a more focussed and active approach to relations with Asia.  
   The potential for long term economic partnership between India and the  
   EU was projected to EU countries as well as the European Commission. 
<br>-70&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The new Cooperation Agreement between the Republic of India and the  
   European Community on Partnership and Development came into effect on I  
   August 1994. During the 8th Session of the India-EC joint Commission  
   held in Brussels on 10 and 11 October 1994, it was agreed that there was  
   significant untapped potential for reinforcing and diversifying existing  
   economic relations between India and the EU which could be achieved  
   through operationalising of the new Agreement based on partnership,  
   dialogue and mutual benefit. The broad principles of a strategy for  
   economic and development cooperation with the EU up to the year 2000 was  
   agreed on, focussing on continued assistance from the EU to India's  
   development efforts, particularly in the social sectors such as primary  
   education, health and employment as well as mutually beneficial economic  
   cooperation. The Joint Commission also discussed questions related to  
   market access, and decided to set up an Ad Hoc Working Party to  
   coordinate Science and Technology Cooperation and to consider a separate  
   Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in this field. The Joint  
   Commission also decided to reconstitute its two principal subsidiary  
   bodies, the Working Groups on Trade and Economic Cooperation and on  
   Development Cooperation, and to set up within them such other Working  
   Parties as may be required. 
<br> 
<br>Recognising the increasing role and importance of the European  
   Parliament as one of the pillars of European integration, special  
   efforts were made to develop wide-ranging contacts with Members of  
   European Parliament (MEPs) who were kept fully informed of the correct  
   facts regarding matters of interest to them. Steps were taken to invite  
   influential MEN to visit India.

   cooperate in the search for solutions to global challenges posed by  
   weapons of mass destruction, AIDS, environmental degradation, population

   US cooperation through 1994-95. Bilateral trade in 1993 equalled US$ 7.3  
   billion with a trade surplus of US$ 1.8 billion in India's favour. The

   trade negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>A bilateral review of the 1984 Memorandum of Understanding on the Export

<br> 
<br>During the year, the US Administration kept under consideration the  
   question of allowing the transfer to Pakistan of F-16 aircrafts through  
   a one-time waiver of the Pressler Amendment. The Administration's  
   proposal, which would have needed approval of the US Congress, would  
   have required a verifiable cap on Pakistan's production of fissile  
   material and freezing of its holding of components usable in nuclear  
   weapons. However, the proposal did not go through during the year.  
   Pakistan reportedly refused to consider any such capping. 
<br> 
<br>US pronouncements on the human rights situation in India gave rise to  
   considerable misunderstanding. Differences in perception continued over  
   Pakistan's support to terrorism. However, the situation improved later  
   in the year as a result of greater restraint and objectivity exercised  
   by US authorities. The Indian Government's policy of increased  
   transparency was widely appreciated. Steps taken by Government of India  
   to restore normalcy and move towards elections in Jammu and Kashmir  
   received some positive response from the US.

<tr><td>The United Nations is presently in the process of restructuring and  
   reforming both in terms of institutions and concepts. India's efforts  
   during the year were directed at influencing these changes in accordance  
   with her world view and her perceptions of the role of the United  
   Nations. This involved hard and painstaking negotiations at every level  
   leading to the development of formulations that would effectively secure  
   the interests of the developing world, including India. Recognising the  
   imperatives of change, India accepted the concepts and institutions that  
   did not alter the basic premises on which the UN was founded. India also  
   made a major contribution to the discussions on the Agenda for  
   Development which started early in the year. Effectively articulating  
   the concerns of the developing world, India put forward concrete and  
   forceful proposals at the ECOSOC, World Hearings on Development and at  
   the General Assembly. The revised Agenda for Development represents a  
   success of the Indian diplomacy. India's contribution to the preparatory  
   process of the World Summit for Social Development was also significant. 
<br> 
<br>India was successful in generating international opinion in favour of a  
   comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council, on the basis of  
   criteria without any predetermined selection of countries.  
   Simultaneously, India also staked her claim for the permanent membership  
   of the Security Council during the General Debate in the 49th session of  
   the General Assembly. 
<br>-81&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Other major achievements of Indian diplomacy at the United Nations were  
   : the adoption of a Declaration on Measures to eliminate terrorism by  
   the Sixth Committee of the UN; and the initiative to convene a fourth  
   Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament (SSOD- 
   IV). India also continued to effectively participate in the UN Peace  
   Keeping Operations across the globe. 
<br> 
<br>India effectively countered Pakistan's propaganda about Jammu and  
   Kashmir and its strenuous efforts to get the General Assembly to adopt a  
   resolution on this subject. Apart from setting the record straight in  
   different fora on several occasions, a sustained and systematic effort  
   was maintained to ensure that Pakistan's baseless allegations and  
   ulterior objectives were defeated. 
<br> 
<br>India constituted a National Committee for Commemoration of the Fiftieth  
   Anniversary of the United Nations and undertook an ambitious, well- 
   designed and substantive programme of yearlong activities to mark the  
   event. The celebration was inaugurated on 30 October 1994 (representing  
   the commencement of fiftieth year of India's association with the United  
   Nations) by Prime Minister's address to the nation and a cultural  
   programme, coupled with a photographic exhibition. 
<br> 
<br>India hosted, during the year, the visits of the UN Secretary General,  
   Boutros-Boutros Ghali, and President of the 48th session of the General  
   Assembly Insanally. During his visit to India from 8 to 10 September  
   1994, the UN Secretary General expressed his gratitude for India's  
   contribution to the UN Peace-Keeping activities. The Secretary General  
   also exchanged views on global issues with the Prime Minister as well as

<br>The UN General Assembly Working Group on "Question of Equitable  
   Representation on, and increase in the membership of the Security  
   Council" continued its discussions during the year. These discussions  
   have not so far produced any consensus on criteria, or candidates, for  
   admission to permanent members category of the Security Council. The  
   term of the Working Group has been extended for another year. 
<br> 
<br>During his speech in the General Debate at the 49th session of the UN  
   General Assembly, Commerce Minister, the leader of the Indian  
   delegation, stated that whatever the criteria-population, size of the  
   economy, contribution to the maintenance of international peace and  
   security and to peace-keeping, or future potential-India deserves to be  
   a permanent member of the Security Council. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote a letter to the President of the  
   Security Council on 11 August 1994 calling for an increase in the  
   strength of UNMOGIP observers on both sides of the Line of Control in  
   Jammu and Kashmir. A similar letter was addressed to the UN Secretary  
   General. This Pakistani move has not found any support in the Security  
   Council so far. 
<br> 
<br>The UN Secretary General in his Annual Report on the work of the  
   Organisation made a brief reference to India and Pakistan, in which he  
   stressed his willingness to exert every possible effort to facilitate a  
   search for a solution should the two sides so wish. India has made it  
   very clear that she remains ' committed to the Simla Agreement, which  
   calls for resolution of all outstanding issues bilaterally. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan tried to table a resolution against India in the First  
   Committee of the UN General Assembly through an OIC Con- 
tact Group. Prompt and effective counter-measures initiated by this  
   Ministry forced Pakistan to abandon the move after failing to receive  
   adequate support.
<br>-83&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India also announced her candidature for election to the nonpermanent  
   seat in the Security Council for the year 1996-97. 
<br> 
<br>The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea entered into force on 16  
   November 1994. A meeting was organised in Jamaica to commemorate the  
   entry into force of the Agreement. The first meeting of the  
   International Seabed Authority (ISA), created under the Convention, was  
   also held in Jamaica from 16 to 19 November 1994. Earlier, India had  
   played a major role in the negotiations leading to the Agreement related  
   to implementation of Part XI of the Convention concerning deep sea-bed  
   mining and exploration, which was adopted unanimously by the resumed  
   48th session of the UN General Assembly in June 1994. 
<br> 
<br>The First Committee of the UN General Assembly, on 22 November 1994,  
   adopted by consensus a resolution on this subject, bringing to an end a  
   chapter of unnecessary controversy surrounding the subject. The item had  
   been first inscribed on the agenda of the General Assembly in 1983.  
   Since 1985, there has been no consensus on this subject, until this  
   year.

<tr><td>During the period under review, positive initiatives in the, field of  
   global disarmament, which began in the immediate aftermath of the end of  
   the Cold War, were further consolidated. India continued to play a  
   leading role in various multilateral disarmament fora-the Conference on  
   Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, the UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC) and the  
   First Committee of the UNGA. 
<br> 
<br>In keeping with her long-standing approach to nuclear disarmament as the  
   first step towards general and complete disarmament, India was actively  
   associated with global measures which would be essential for the  
   elimination of nuclear weapons in a time-bound manner. Progress was  
   achieved to some extent in the area of a comprehensive test ban and a  
   freeze in the production of fissile material for weapons. 
<br>-84&gt; 
<br> 
<br>In January 1994, an Ad hoc Committee of the CD on Nuclear Test Ban (NTB)  
   with a full negotiating mandate to conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban  
   Treaty (CTBT) was established. Since 1954, India has been calling for a  
   comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. It was only in 1993 that there was  
   a perceptible shift in the stand of the nuclear weapons states on this  
   issue. In December 1993, India co-sponsored a consensus UNGA resolution  
   which called for an early conclusion of a CTBT. India has been actively  
   participating in the negotiations at Geneva. The Indian delegate is the  
   Friend of Chair (FOC) on Seismic Methods, under the Working Group on  
   Verification. India has presented several papers on both seismic and  
   non-seismic methods which would be useful components of the future  
   verification system of the CTBT. A draft "rolling text" of the CTBT was  
   finalised in September 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Further to the 1993 UN consensus resolution co-sponsored by India which  
   called for negotiations on a Convention on the Prohibition of the  
   Production of Fissionable Material for Weapons Purposes' a Special Co- 
   ordinator was set up at the Conference on Disarmament. India had hoped  
   that a consensus resolution calling for an Ad hoc Committee of the CD  
   with a negotiating mandate to be set up would be adopted by the current  
   session of the UNGA. However, due to continued differences on the scope  
   of the mandate and the insistence by some countries on the inclusion of  
   stockpiles within the purview, the resolution could not be tabled this  
   year. 
<br> 
<br>India also tabled a resolution on the subject of a Convention on the  
   Prohibition of the Use and Threat of Use of Nuclear Weapons. The First  
   Committee of the UN adopted it with 98 votes in favour. The voting  
   pattern revealed that some of the nuclear weapons states and their  
   allies continue to oppose the resolution. India also co-sponsored a new  
   resolution calling for a step-by-step reduction of the nuclear weapons  
   which was adopted by the First Committee with 91 votes in favour. 
<br> 
<br>For long, India has been calling for the outlawing of nuclear weapons,  
   on the argument that the use of such weapons constitutes a crime against  
   humanity and a violation of the UN Charter. Accordingly, India submitted  
   a statement to the Interna- 
<br>-85&gt; 
<br> 
<br>tional Court of Justice (ICJ) on 10 June 1994 as a follow-up to a World  
   Health Assembly resolution of May 1993, requesting the ICJ for an  
   advisory opinion on the legality of the use of such weapons in terms of  
   their effects on health and environment. At the current session of the  
   UNGA, a NAM draft resolution requesting the ICJ on the legality of the  
   threat or use of nuclear weapons was adopted by 77 votes in favour of  
   the First Committee, overcoming the stiff opposition by some of the  
   nuclear weapons states (NWS) and their allies. 
<br> 
<br>India's proposal for the convening of a Fourth Special Session of the  
   General Assembly devoted to Disarmament (SSOD-IV) put forward in June  
   1994 at the Cairo meeting of NAM Foreign Ministers was taken up  
   enthusiastically by NAM and presented as a NAM initiative at the current  
   session of the UNGA. A consensus resolution agreeing in principle to the  
   convening of such a session in 1997, with the dates "to be considered at  
   its 50th regular session" was adopted by the First Committee of the UNGA  
   on 19 November. 
<br> 
<br>India was also actively involved in UN expert groups on the Register on  
   Conventional Arms, the Inhumane Weapons Convention, and Verification in  
   All Its Aspects. The UN expert group on the Conventional Arms Register  
   concluded its work in August 1994 and recommended that, in view of the  
   lack of consensus, the scope of the Register (currently confined to arms  
   transfers) need not be expanded. India actively supported the idea of a  
   ban on the export of anti-personnel land mines at the expert group level  
   and co-sponsored a UN resolution on the subject. 
<br> 
<br>India continued her principled opposition to ad hoc export control  
   regimes such as the Australia Group, Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and  
   the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in various international  
   fora and called for their conversion into universal, transparent, non- 
   discriminatory treaties which clearly distinguish between civilian "and  
   military applications. An MTCR Quad team consisting of representatives  
   of Switzerland, US, UK and Australia visited India on 30 August 1994 for  
   official level discussions. This is in keeping with the recent MTCR  
   decision to hold consultations with other coun-tries with an advanced scientific and industrial base. The exchange of  
   views was useful and enabled both sides to obtain a better understanding  
   of each other's positions.
<br>-86&gt;
<br> 
<br>A Special Conference of the States Parties of the Biological Weapons  
   Convention (BWC) was held at Geneva from 18 to 30 September 1994. India  
   participated actively as one of the Vice Presidents of the Conference  
   which resulted in the setting up of an ad hoc group of experts to  
   consider verification measures for the BWC. 
<br> 
<br>India's views on the Australia Group have been articulated time and  
   again at the Preparatory Commission (PREPCOM) of the Organisation for  
   the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) which meets in plenary  
   sessions and expert level meetings at The Hague. India, which became an  
   original signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993,  
   is fully involved in the activities of the Preparatory Commission. Her  
   delegate is the Chairman of three of the Expert Groups of the PREPCOM.  
   Besides, technical experts from concerned departments have been  
   regularly participating in the inter-sessional meetings. 
<br> 
<br>In pursuance of her global disarmament agenda, especially in the context  
   of the changing international security environment, India continued  
   bilateral dialogues on disarmament, non-proliferation and security- 
   related issues with the US, France and Germany. Bilateral initiatives at  
   the highest level resulted in two signal achievements-(i) the issuance  
   of a joint statement by Prime Minister Rao and President Clinton in May  
   1994 offering their strong support for efforts towards non-proliferation  
   of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and towards  
   the progressive reduction with the goal of elimination of such weapons  
   and (ii) a joint declaration issued by Prime Minister Rao and President  
   Yeltsin reiterating their commitment to all measures aimed at the  
   complete and universal elimination of the weapons of mass destruction.  
   India also utilised these dialogues to effectively project her position  
   that her security concerns cannot be addressed in the narrow framework  
   of India-Pakistan relations but as part of a global problem which would  
   require a global solution.

<tr><td>India continued to take a vigorous part in discussions on human rights  
   in UN fora. India's stand in UN fora was rooted in her commitment to  
   protection and promotion of human rights at home and abroad. 
<br> 
<br>India's consistent stand in the UN fora was that human rights should be  
   pursued in the Vienna spirit of cooperation and consensus. India does  
   not favour selectively targeting individual countries through  
   politically motivated resolutions. 
<br> 
<br>During the year, the National Human Rights Commission was established  
   through an Act of the Parliament. The Commission has wide-ranging powers  
   of over-sight and enquiry. The Commission covers all parts of the  
   country, including Jammu and Kashmir. The Commission has already started  
   functioning. The Commission's recommendation on Bijbehara incident was  
   accepted by Government for implementation. 
<br> 
<br>A number of envoys visited Jammu and Kashmir. This reflected India's  
   policy of transparency in protection and promotion of human rights. 
<br> 
<br></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td>During the 50th session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva from  
   31 January to 11 March 1994, Pakistan tabled a resolution against India  
   on Kashmir issue. The resolution called for despatch of a fact-finding  
   mission to Jammu and Kashmir. India apprised the international community  
   of the facts about Jammu and Kashmir. The international community did  
   not find merit in Pakistan's resolution. Failing to muster adequate  
   support for her move, Pakistan was forced to withdraw the resolution  
   unilaterally and unconditionally. 
<br> 
<br>During the session, a resolution on Human Rights and Terrorism was  
   adopted by consensus. The resolution unequivocally condemned all acts,  
   methods and practices of terrorism wherever and by whomsoever committed. 
<br> 
<br>Human rights and humanitarian issues were also considered at the  
   substantive session of the Economic and Social Council under the social  
   sector from 20 to 29 July 1994. Pakistan raked up the Kashmir issue under the Agenda item on Human Rights questions through  
   statements by its official delegation as well as NGOs sponsored by  
   Pakistan.
 <br>-88&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India, like other UN member-states, participated as an observer in the  
   46th session of the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination  
   and Protection of Minorities. This body comprises * of experts acting in  
   their individual capacity. The session lasted from 1 to 26 August 1994.  
   Pakistani moves to float a resolution were successfully thwarted. 
<br> 
<br>During this session, the Sub-Commission adopted a resolution on Human  
   Rights and Terrorism condemning terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>After their failure to table a resolution against India in the First  
   Committee of the UN General Assembly, Pakistan continued efforts to  
   table a resolution against India in the Third Committee. However  
   Pakistan could not find enough support to table the resolution. 
<br> 
<br>The adoption at the 49th General Assembly of a Declaration on Measures  
   to Eliminate International Terrorism was an achievement of India's  
   diplomacy in the United Nations. The resolution unequivocally condemns  
   the acts, methods and practices of terrorism as activities aimed at the  
   destruction of human rights and fundamental freedoms and democracy,  
   threatening the territorial integrity and security of States and  
   destabilising the legitimately constituted governments. It called upon  
   all States to take effective measures to prevent, combat and eliminate  
   terrorism. Similar resolutions condemning terrorism were also adopted in  
   other UN and international fora like the Commission on Human Rights,  
   44th session of the International Conference on Education, 145th session  
   of the UNESCO Executive Board, etc. The resolutions reflect the growing  
   understanding of terrorism by the international community as violative  
   of human rights and threatening to the security and territorial  
   integrity of Nation States.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>India continued to play an active role in the Economic and Social  
   Council, the Governing Boards of the specialised agencies, vari-ous international meetings on the issue of promotion and protection of  
   environment, and in the Second Committee of the United Nations. She  
   sought to ensure that developmental issues were emphasised in various  
   activities of the United Nations. India sought to ensure that the United  
   Nations' "Agenda for Development" should be goal-oriented and  
   incorporate clear plans of action for the development of developing  
   nations. It should include a commitment to an open, fair and equitable  
   international environment conducive to sustained and accelerated  
   economic growth and provide additional resources for the developmental  
   needs of the developing countries. India participated actively in the  
   Public Hearings on the "Agenda for Development" organised by the  
   President of the 48th session of the UN General Assembly and in the  
   subsequent discussions on this issue in the course of the 49th session  
   of the General Assembly. India also ensured that the "Agenda for  
   Development" neither becomes an adjunct to the Agenda for Peace nor  
   should it be overshadowed in the current preoccupation with security  
   issues and peace-keeping activities of the United Nations. 
<br>-89&gt;
<br> 
<br>The substantive session of the Economic and Social Council, including a  
   High Level Segment was held in June-July 1994. The meeting focussed on  
   the Agenda for Development; follow-up to the resolution adopted in the  
   48th session of the General Assembly on the restructuring and  
   revitalisation of the United Nations in the economic and social fields;  
   operational activities for development; etc. 
<br> 
<br>While the United Nations continued to emphasise the traditional issues  
   like debt, development, transfer of resources, it also focussed on  
   issues relating to environment and social and humanitarian concerns. 
<br> 
<br>India actively participated in the activities connected with the  
   implementation of the agreements reached at the UN Conference on  
   Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and related  
   follow-up action. The specific important areas of activities are  
   highlighted below: 
<br> 
<br>(a) The Second Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development  
   (CSD), including the High Level Segment, was held from 16 to 27 May 1994  
   in New York. India was elected to the 
 
   Bureau and became a Vice Chairman, representing Asia. This election was  
   all the more important since it came at a time crucial to the CSD  
   process. Furthermore, it enabled India to effectively pursue her  
   objectives regarding greater provision of financial resources by the  
   international community for the implementation of Agenda 21. India was  
   also elected as the Chairperson of the Working Group I of the Commission  
   on Sustainable Development, which discussed the critical and broad-based  
   issues of finance, technology, trade and environment,, consumption  
   patterns, decision-making structures, etc. The document adopted by  
   Working Group I of the Commission expressed clear concern at the  
   inadequate availability of new and additional resources and added that  
   such a state will constrain effective implementation of Agenda 21 and  
   could undermine the basis of the global partnership for sustainable  
   development. The need for further replenishment of the Global  
   Environment Facility was also highlighted. Efforts for bringing ODA  
   levels in line with 0.7% of GNP target were reaffirmed and a call given  
   for substantial early commitments of concessional funding to accelerate  
   the initial phase of the implementation of Agenda 21. Innovative  
   approaches for mobilising financial resources, in particular in  
   developed countries were proposed. Broad public support and generating  
   the political momentum and CSD's role in this process were highlighted.
<br>-90&gt; 
<br> 
<br>It was decided that the Inter Sessional Working Group (ISWG) on Finance  
   would continue its deliberations on these issues. 
<br> 
<br>The Report of the open-ended Ad Hoc Inter Sessional Working Group on  
   Technology Transfer was also considered by the CSD. While recognising  
   the constraints faced by the developing countries in their endeavours to  
   promote or actively, participate in technology transfers, the Working  
   Group had been unable to propose concrete action-programmes for  
   consideration by the Commission. The final resolution adopted by the CSD  
   on this issue is a diluted version of the recommendations of the ISWG on  
   technology transfer and largely exhorts the UN system to consider  
   appropriate means of technology transfer. CSD has so far not been able  
   to take the process much beyond Rio. There is still no agreement on the  
   definition of environmentally sound technologies or mechanisms for  
   facilitation of their transfer to the developing countries. 
<br>-91&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The High Level Segment was attended by Minister of State for Environment  
   and Forests. Several delegations of other countries participating in the  
   High Level Segment mentioned that participation in CSD should not be  
   restricted to the environment ministries of different countries at the  
   technical level, but should be broadened to include representatives of  
   finance, economic, planning, and agriculture ministries, depending on  
   the subjects being covered. 
<br> 
<br>(b) An inter-governmental group had been established to begin  
   negotiations for a Convention to Combat Desertification with Special  
   Reference to Africa. Regular discussions were held in Geneva and Paris  
   and the Convention finalised at the Fifth Meeting of the Inter- 
   governmental negotiating committee in Paris in June 1994. India signed  
   the Convention when it was opened for signatures in Paris on 14 October  
   1994. Indian delegation ensured that the provisions of the Convention  
   and the Regional Implementation Annex for Asia did not contain articles  
   that were liable to misinterpretation. 
<br> 
<br>(c) As mandated by the UN Conference on Environment and Development and  
   the General Assembly resolution 47/192, a conference was organised in  
   July 1993. Further negotiations were continued in March and August 1994.  
   A draft agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the UN  
   Convention on the Law of the Sea is presently being considered. India  
   has been actively projecting the needs and requirements of the coastal  
   states. India has also forcefully expressed the need for assistance to  
   developing countries, both financial and technical, not only for the  
   conservation and management measures but also to enable them to exploit  
   the resources of the high seas. 
<br> 
<br>(d) The IX and X sessions of the Inter-governmental Negotiating  
   Committee to prepare for the First Conference of Parties of the  
   Framework Convention on Climate Change were held during the year. India  
   actively participated in them and worked assiduously to strengthen the  
   application of the provisions of the Convention related to policy  
   guidelines, financial resources and incremental costs. 
<br> 
<br>(e) The second session of the Inter-governmental Committee on Convention  
   on Bio-Diversity was held in Nairobi from 20 June 
    
   to I July 1994. This was the last session prior to the first meeting of  
   the Conference of Parties organised in Bahamas from 28 November to 9  
   December 1994. Indian delegation succeeded in safeguarding India's  
   concerns and in promoting India's interests. It ensured the finalisation  
   of some programme priorities and inclusion of clear references to  
   national priorities in them. It was also able to secure incorporation of  
   "endemism" as a programme priority. On the issue of institutional  
   structure, it was decided that Global Environment Facility (GEF) should  
   continue as an interim financial mechanism. India was also able to seek  
   endorsement from the G-77 and effectively project her views on the issue  
   of conclusion of a Protocol on Bio-Safety, Farmers' Rights and ex-situ  
   collections, collections of CGIAR system, criteria for selection of the  
   Secretariat, funding of the Secretariat, etc. India also circulated a  
   Draft Agenda for the First Meeting of the Conference of Parties, which  
   was unanimously approved by the G-77 and appreciated by the Chairman and  
   was used for finalising the Agenda of the Conference of Parties by the  
   Secretariat.
   <br>-92&gt; 
<br> 
<br>(f) First meeting of the Executive Council of the restructured Global  
   Environment Facility (GEF) was held in Washington on 12 and 13 July 1994  
   and the second in October 1994. India is a donor and recipient nation  
   and has contributed SDR 6 million (US$ 8.5 million approximately) to the  
   total GEF corpus of US$ 2 billion. GEF is expected to fund the financial  
   mechanisms of the Convention on Climate Change and Diversity, and  
   Framework Convention on Climate Change, and measures to combat pollution  
   of international waters, and the ill-effects of desertification. India  
   has been playing a leading role in GEF and also in the implementation of  
   the Conventions that it is expected to fund. 
<br> 
<br>As a recognition of the prominent role played by India, the Indian  
   member of the Executive Council Shri N K Singh, Additional Secretary of  
   the Department of Economic Affairs, was unanimously elected as the first  
   Chairman of, the GEF Executive Council. The Chairmanship would rotate  
   between the recipient and non-recipient nations from one meeting to the  
   other. As first elected Chairman, India will have an opportunity to play  
   a constructive role and lead the facility in the desired direction. 
<br>-93&gt; 
<br> 
<br>(g) During the year inter-governmental meetings of the Montreal  
   Protocol, the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of  
   Hazardous Wastes, Inter-government Panel on Climate Change and  
   Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species were held. India  
   actively participated in these meetings . 
<br> 
<br>A development of far-reaching importance and wider portents, which  
   emanated from the discussions in the environmental spheres, was the  
   consolidation of the Association of Small Islands Developing States  
   (AOSIS). The Association had been established at the First Conference on  
   Sustainable Development of Small Islands Developing States held in  
   Barbados in April 1994. India had actively participated in that  
   Conference too, and projected the needs as well as the achievements in  
   the field of sustainable development of small islands of India, like  
   Andamans and Nicobar group, etc. 
<br> 
<br>The Group of 77 (developing nations) commemorated the thirtieth  
   anniversary of its establishment by a Special Ministerial Meeting  
   organised in New York on 24 June 1994. India was represented by Minister  
   of State for External Affairs Shri Salman Khurshid. 
<br> 
<br>India hosted the 50th session of the ESCAP in New Delhi in April 1994.  
   India also continued to take an active part in various activities for  
   the Asia and Pacific region organised by ESCAP. India ensured that  
   activities prejudicial to her national interests were not undertaken by  
   the organisation. 
<br> 
<br>Consistent with the renewed emphasis accorded by the United Nations to  
   the social and humanitarian issues, a number of new initiatives were  
   undertaken during the year. These included: 
<br> 
<br>(a) The third International Conference on Population and Development was  
   held in Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994. Indian delegation was led by  
   the Minister of Health and Family Welfare and included Minister of State  
   for External Affairs Shri Salman Khurshid. Addressing the plenary, the  
   leader of the Indian delegation, the then Minister of Health and Family  
   Welfare, Shri B Shankaranand reiterated strongly the need for 
<br>-94&gt; 
<br> 
<br>enhanced international cooperation in this sphere. He also pointed out  
   that the problem of demographic growth could only be addressed through  
   integrated solutions, encompassing health, family welfare, education,  
   women empowerment, employment and eradication of poverty. 
<br> 
<br>India's concerns on international interference in dealing with internal  
   migration, the assertion of right to development as a fundamental right,  
   importance of education and empowerment of women, and increased resource  
   flows from the developed to the developing nations have been well  
   reflected in the document. India also stressed these issues in the  
   discussions on follow up to the Conference in the 49th session of the  
   General Assembly. 
<br> 
<br>(b) India constituted a National Committee to prepare for the World  
   Summit on Social Development. The country report of India to the Summit  
   was prepared and distributed at the second session of the Preparatory  
   Committee for the World Summit for Social Development held in New York  
   in August-September 1994. The draft Declaration and Programme of Action

   session of the Preparatory Committee held in January 1995. India has  
   been actively participating in these discussions and her concerns on the  
   issue of poverty eradication, provision of full and productive  
   employment and social integration, while respecting the plurality of  
   societies have been forcefully expressed and incorporated in the  
   documents.

<br>(c) The Fourth World Conference on Women is another important  
   international meeting to be held in Beijing in June 1995. The aim of the  
   meeting is to focus on women's issues particularly the need to raise the  
   status of women in the society. India participated in the regional  
   meeting held in Jakarta to prepare for the meeting and is actively  
   contributing to other preparatory activities.

   enlarging the Executive Committee of the UN High Commissioner for  
   Refugees from 47 to 50. By virtue of this enlargement, India, along with  
   two other countries (Russia and Bangladesh) would become member of the  
   Executive Committee after the next organisational session of ECOSOC to  
   be held in April 1995. 
<br> 
<br>India participated actively in the 144th and 145th sessions of the  
   UNESCO Executive Board, ensuring that the Organisation did not deviate  
   from its Charter mandate. India also ensured that intrusive elements  
   were not sought to be introduced in the UNESCO's programmes. India also  
   forcefully expressed the need for UNESCO to concentrate also on  
   developmental issues, as a part of its Medium Term Plan for 1995-2001. 
<br> 
<br>UNESCO, as the lead agency for commemorating the UN Year of Tolerance,  
   also organised activities to mark the 125th Birth Anniversary of the  
   Apostle of Tolerance-Mahatma Gandhi. A medallion was struck by UNESCO  
   and other activities are also planned during 1995.

   attached to socio-economic development cooperation under the  
   Commonwealth banner. Chief Anyaoku paid tribute to India's contribution

   an Anglo-centric past and expressed the hope that the Commonwealth  
   philosophy of mutual help and Jawaharlal Nehru's legacy of the "healing

<br>International Law: Developments and Activities 
<br> 
<br>India participated in the 46th Session of the International Law  
   Commission (ILC) which was held at Geneva from 2 May to 22 July 1994. At  
   this session, the Commission completed the drafting of a Revised Statute  
   on the establishment of an International Criminal Court, the Second and  
   Final reading of the Draft Articles on the Non-Navigational Uses of  
   International Water Courses and the examination of the concept of crime  
   attributable to the State itself and attendant consequences of such  
   State Responsibility. The Commission commenced the Second and Final  
   reading of the Draft Code of Crimes Against Peace and Security of  
   Mankind and International Liability for Acts not Prohibited by  
   International Law studied in the context of evolving principles of  
   prevention. 
<br> 
<br>The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) held  
   its 27th session from 31 May to 17 June 1994 at New York. The session  
   was devoted to the consideration of the Draft Model Law on Procurement

<tr><td>In keeping with the global trend, the requirements of the national  
   economy and social as well as political priorities, the Ministry of  
   External Affairs continued to give special and focussed attention to  
   economic diplomacy at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.  
   The Economic and Multilateral Economic Relations Divisions of the  
   Ministry played an important role in providing vitality and substantive  
   content to the Ministry's efforts in this area. The co-option of  
   academics, nongovernmental organisations, representatives of trade and  
   industry and other economic actors was intended to ensure that these  
   efforts translate themselves into practical results. An important part  
   of the Ministry's effort was to expand existing opportunities and create  
   new ones for trade, investment and technological cooperation with the  
   industrialised, newly industrialising and developing countries which  
   have achieved or have a promising potential to achieve rapid economic  
   and technological growth. This initiative was taken through bilateral  
   approaches, evolving new regional and trans-regional arrangements and  
   appropriate initiatives in international fora such as the NAM, the G-77  
   and the UN. 
<br> 
<br>Recognising that the success of India's economic development and reform  
   programme can only be assured and sustained in a favourable  
   international economic environment, the effort was to forge a consensus  
   in the international fora in favour of global policies supportive of  
   economic development and growth par-ticularly of developing countries. The Ministry worked along with other  
   concerned Ministries to resist attempts at protectionism, injection of  
   conditionalities on trade and aid and diversion of focus and resources  
   to sectoral and socio-political issues.
<br>-103&gt; 
<br> 
<br>There was a constant monitoring of not only all development policy  
   evolutions in multilateral, regional and national contexts effecting the  
   Indian economy, but also of emergent thinking in the UN and the  
   Multilateral Financial Institutions on the issue of development.  
   Wherever it was felt that India's interests were not properly  
   safeguarded or sufficient importance was not given to the concerns of  
   developing countries in the evolution of a new paradigm for  
   international cooperation, the Ministry was active in raising  
   consciousness within the country and among other developing and  
   developed partner countries. 
<br> 
<br>The year marked the 50th anniversary of the setting up of the United  
   Nations as well as the Bretton Woods institutions and the Ministry was  
   involved in the ongoing review of the role and relevance of these  
   institutions in the new context of economic multipolarity and increasing  
   dynamism and global profile of developing countries particularly in  
   Asia. Global emphasis on entrepreneurial skills and initiative as  
   against dirigist intervention of the state to ensure economic growth and  
   social well-being called for a new look at these institutions. Several  
   concept papers on this theme were prepared by the Ministry for  
   discussion among developing countries as well as for interaction with  
   developed countries. 
<br> 
<br>In spite of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade  
   Negotiations, certain developed countries continued their efforts to  
   increase protectionism, create new trade conditionalities and non-tariff  
   barriers and apply pressures on developing countries to give increased  
   market access on terms beyond those agreed in the Uruguay Round. These  
   and other issues affecting market access for Indian goods and services  
   were monitored and sought to be ameliorated and countered. One of the  
   issues raised by certain developed countries is the establishment of a  
   linkage between international trade and labour standards. The argument  
   being given is that low level of wages and workers' benefits in  
   developing countries, constitute an unfair trade ad- 
    
   vantage and goods exported by using such labour amount to social  
   dumping. There is an attempt to secure compliance of certain "Social  
   Clause" related ILO Conventions by establishing a linkage with trade.  
   The Ministry undertook internal, interministerial and inter-governmental  
   consultations to help formulate and project India's position on this  
   subject in international. fora.
   <br>-104&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India's engagement in economic cooperation among a trans-regional group  
   of developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa assumed  
   special significance this year as the reconvened 4th Summit of the G-15  
   was held in New Delhi from 28 to 30 March 1994. The Summit reaffirmed  
   the relevance of the Group and gave it a new dynamism by setting up an  
   institutional framework and a substantive agenda for cooperation. It was  
   decided to broaden the scope of intra-G-15 cooperation through the  
   establishment of a Committee on Trade, Investment and Technology (CITT)  
   to work towards evolution of trans-regional arrangements for  
   liberalisation, facilitation and promotion of trade, investment and  
   technology transfer. The private sector will play a crucial role and  
   will be closely associated in this endeavour. The CITT will also  
   establish inter-active links with related G-15 projects such as the  
   South Investment, Trade and Technology Data Exchange Centre (SITTDEC),  
   Business Forum and certain techno-economic projects being coordinated by  
   India in Solar Energy and Gene Banks of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. 
<br> 
<br>The Business Forum including a large number of businessmen and trade  
<br>representatives from several G-15 countries, held a meeting in tandem  
   with the Summit. The Business Forum drew up action plans for  
   strengthening transport, financial and information infra-structure to  
   expand cooperation in trade, investment, technological exchanges and  
   tourism. 
<br> 
<br>The Summit decided to harness the information and communication  
   revolution to promote better understanding and knowledge of  
   capabilities, potential and experiences of G-15 countries among each  
   other. It asked the Troika Foreign Ministers to facilitate the setting  
   up of an expert group to make recommendations on information  
   infrastructure and communication systems 
<br>-105&gt; 
<br> 
<br>required by the G-15 countries. It agreed to extend full support through  
   appropriate projects for expanding cooperation in the setting up of  
   small scale industries, especially in Africa. 
<br> 
<br>The Summit agreed that the meetings of G-15 Ministers of Foreign  
   Affairs, Economy, Trade, Agriculture, Environment and Science and  
   Technology would be held on a regular basis in the inter-Summit period  
   for expanding cooperation in sectoral areas. It decided to guard against  
   new trade restricting tendencies in the developed world using the  
   pretext of social ' or environmental concerns, which were aimed at  
   nullifying the comparative advantage of the economies of the South such  
   as raw materials, wage structure, etc. It was agreed that G-15 ministers  
   would meet at Marrakesh on the occasion of the concluding conference on  
   the Uruguay Round to ensure coordination. 
<br> 
<br>The Summit undertook a review of the international situation and  
   economic, political, environmental challenges faced by the developing  
   countries and shared experiences of G-15 countries in meeting these  
   challenges. It reaffirmed the equal importance of attention to peace and  
   development in a restructured and democratised UN to realise a more  
   equitable, prosperous and secure world order. A Joint Communique was  
   issued setting out the views of the G-15 countries on major issues. 
<br> 
<br>The Prime Minister as Chairman sent a copy of the communique for  
   information and consideration to the then Chairman of the G-7, the Prime  
   Minister of Italy. The Summit decided that the on-going G-15 initiative  
   on a constructive and focussed dialogue with the G-7 would be carried  
   forward. It was agreed that the Fifth G-15 Summit would be held at  
   Buenos Aires in 1995 and the Sixth Summit at Harare in 1996. 
<br> 
<br>A G-15 ministerial meeting held in New York on 28 September 1994 decided  
   that all inputs to develop the terms of reference and work programme of  
   the CITT will be provided by the members by November 1994. The  
   ministerial meeting held a substantive exchange of views on global  
   issues and challenges aimed at prosperity and well-being of all peoples  
   in the 21st century and required multilateral institutions to meet those  
   challenges. The ministerial meeting also endorsed a new quorum rule for  
   future attendance at the G-15 Summits which pro- 
<br>-106&gt; 
<br> 
<br>vides for participation of at least five Heads of State/Government and  
   three Vice Presidents/Deputy Prime Ministers (number two in their  
   respective governments). 
<br> 
<br>At the 30th Anniversary commemoration meeting of the Group of 77 held in  
   New York in July 1994, India reaffirmed the historical validity of the  
   concept, purposes and endeavours of the Group of 77 and of her mission  
   to obtain for developing countries a larger voice in global economic  
   decision making. By inserting a development dimension and consensus in  
   international institutions and policies, the G-77 had acted as a  
   development conscience of the world and recorded some gains in this  
   respect. India noted that G-77 was at the crossroads having reached a  
   maturer phase after a period of considerable activity and trial.  
   Developing countries, whatever their specificities, would continue to  
   face common problems-systemic and emergent, and that they would need to  
   work together in the context of a firm but flexible issue-based  
   coalitions to further the common cause of development. The Group of 77  
   issued two ministerial declarations-one general and the other  
   specifically focussed on the Agenda for Development to be evolved under  
   UN auspices. 
<br> 
<br>It is clear that both ASEAN and India attach considerable importance to  
   the rapid development of their sectoral dialogue partnership and much  
   progress has been achieved in a short time both at the governmental and  
   business levels. The first substantive meeting of the ASEAN-India joint  
   Sectoral Cooperation Committee (AIJSCC) was held in Bali, Indonesia from  
   6 to 8 January 1994. It launched cooperation in four sectors, namely,  
   trade, investment, tourism and science and technology. The meeting set  
   up the required institutional structures including an ASEAN-India Fund  
   to finance mutually agreed projects. The second meeting of the AIJSCC is  
   being convened in India from 13 to 17 February 1995 to review the on- 
   going activities and decide on future programme of cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>Progress has been made on developing a plan of action in all sectoral  
   areas. These include: work on trade, liberalisation, facilitation and  
   promotion; establishment of an ASEAN-India Trade and Investment  
   Information and Promotion Centre, col- 
   laboration and joint ventures in India, ASEAN and third countries,  
   encouragement of ASEAN investment in highways, power and tele- 
   communication sectors in India; cooperation in preparation of master  
   plan for tourist destination development, exchange of information and  
   technology, joint promotion of tourist destinations in India and ASEAN,  
   development of integrated tourism marketing programme for India in  
   selected ASEAN markets and for ASEAN in selected Indian markets,  
   cooperation between national carriers of ASEAN countries and India,  
   convening of joint workshops of ASEAN and Indian scientists and  
   technologists to identify specific modalities of collaboration in  
   science and technology. Cooperation is to start in the areas of advanced  
   materials, bio-technology and information technology in terms of  
   research and industrial application. 
<br>-107&gt; 
<br> 
<br>India has offered 12 scholarships in science and technology to ASEAN  
   scientists for research and study in India. An ASEAN-India Business  
   Expert Group comprising two experts from each side has been set up to  
   prepare detailed modalities for a five-year plan of cooperation in trade  
   and investment; the report of this group is to be considered at the  
   AIJSCC. 
<br> 
<br>As part of India's attempts to establish closer economic ties with the  
   fast growing economies of East-Asia and the Pacific region, India has  
   been following with interest, and establishing contacts with, the  
   evolving Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) grouping. The 18- 
   member group of Asia Pacific economies comprise a market of 2 billion  
   people and account for 48% of the world's GNP and 40% of the world  
   trade. APEC economies account for 45% of India's exports, 30% of its  
   imports and 54% of FDI, since January 1994. India's joining the APEC  
   would confer numerous benefits to both sides and it has been the  
   Ministry's effort to put this across to APEC countries. 
<br> 
<br>The APEC's move toward institutionalisation, consolidation and creation  
   of free trade region at the Bogor Summit of 15 November 1994 provides  
   added significance to India's efforts to join the APEC. Although the  
   free trade declaration provides for a two-track approach for developed  
   and developing countries and avers that it would not be an inward  
   looking trade bloc and will give particular attention to its trade with  
   non-APEC devel- 
<br>-108&gt; 
<br> 
<br>oping economies, Indian interests would need to be taken into account  
   and safeguarded. 
<br> 
<br>India had applied for membership of APEC in September 1991 on the eve of  
   the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Subsequently  
   India has requested to participate in some of the working groups of  
   APEC. India's request for participation in APEC activities is pending  
   along with those of Russia, Argentina, Peru, Israel, Iran since the APEC  
   Ministerial Meeting at Seattle in November 1993 imposed a moratorium for  
   admission of additional members for three years. A' preliminary proposal  
   on modalities of APEC membership policy and other associated issues is  
   to be presented for consideration in 1995. APEC Senior Officials Meeting  
   has been asked to submit to the 1995 APEC Ministerial Meeting criteria  
   and principles for participation by non-members in APEC working groups.  
   Several APEC economies have conveyed indications of their support for  
   India's membership of APEC when this issue is considered by the group  
   and India will continue to convey her interest in joining APEC and to  
   demonstrate the mutuality of benefit of such a move. 
<br> 
<br>In view of the strategic significance and economic potential of the  
   Indian Ocean region, there have been moves in several Indian Ocean  
   countries for establishment of an Indian Ocean Group for Economic  
   Cooperation. It is felt that creation of such a group will enable the  
   countries of the region to realise the full potential of their  
   cooperation in trade, investment, science and technology, tourism,  
   marine resources and environment and help them in improving their  
   transportation and communication links. The Ministry undertook studies  
   on this concept in cooperation with certain research institutions and  
   soundings were made about views of Indian Ocean countries such as  
   Mauritius, South Africa, Australia, Singapore, Malayasia and Indonesia.  
   Mauritius is planning to hold a meeting of senior officials from a few  
   core Indian Ocean countries to exchange views on various aspects of this  
   concept. The representatives of public and private sectors and academics  
   will also be associated in these discussions. The meeting is to  
   recommend the best possible form of cooperation that can be generated in  
   the region. India has also been invited to participate in this meeting. 
<br>-109&gt; 
<br> 
<br>In view of the important role of the OECD countries in global economic,  
   financial, trade and environment policy making and their importance as  
   India's major trade and investment partners and role being played by the  
   OECD Secretariat as a research arm on development issues, the Ministry  
   made contacts with the OECD countries and the OECD Secretariat in Paris  
   to establish closer association with the OECD. India's willingness to  
   establish a closer association with the OECD-the developed country  
   think-tank and inter-governmental economic policy deliberation  
   organisation-was conveyed to individual members of OECD as well as the  
   Secretariat and in the context of OECD Ministerial and other senior  
   level meetings. 
<br> 
<br>The Finance Secretary during a visit to Paris on 4 July 1994 gave a  
   detailed presentation to OECD on economic reforms initiated by India.  
   This was followed by a visit by the President of the OECD Development  
   Centre, Joan Bonvin to India during July 1994. A break-through in  
   India's closer association with the OECD was achieved in December 1994  
   when the OECD Council approved inclusion of India along with Indonesia  
   and China in their OECD Policy Dialogue framework with Dynamic New Major  
   Economies (DNMEs). This would mean that India would be invited to  
   participate in policy workshops that the OECD organises from time to  
   time and provide occasions for regular and thematic interaction. In  
   January 1995, the Ministry sent a fact-finding and familiarisation  
   mission to Paris to confirm India's willingness to be part of OECD's  
   Policy Dialogue. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry continued to further fine tune, adapt and expand its ECDC  
   and TCDC programmes under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation  
   (ITEC) programme and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance  
   Programme (SCAAt) for the benefit of developing countries mainly in  
   Africa, Latin America, Caribbean and South East Asia. A demand-led  
   approach as well as sensitivity to new needs in terms of disciplines and  
   areas covered characterised the manner in which the ITEC and SCAAP  
   programmes were implemented with partner countries. There was a greater  
   meshing of the programmes with tangible economic and commercial  
   interests. 
<br>-110&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Activities under ITEC include training of nominees from partner  
   countries in Indian civilian and defence institutions, execution of  
   projects, extension of consultancy services and undertaking feasibility  
   studies, organising study visits and related TCDC support. 
<br> 
<br>During 1994-95, 875 slots have been allocated for training of foreign  
   nominees in Indian civilian institutions. At present, a total of 65  
   regular courses are being held in 30 prominent institutions in areas as  
   varied as banking, small scale industries, finance, tool research, etc.  
   Apart from traditional fields like small scale industries, stress is  
   increasingly on high-tech areas, such as computers, maintenance of bio- 
   medical equipment, flow process technology, etc whose growing importance  
   and relevance in terms of India's trade/technology promotion efforts are  
   evident. 
<br> 
<br>Apart from Africa (270 slots have been allocated to countries in Africa  
   in 1994-95), the focus is on countries in Central Asia which were  
   allotted 150 slots. A total of 5 special courses with Russian  
   interpretation facilities in foreign trade, banking, entrepreneurship  
   development, small scale industries and financial management are to be  
   held in 1994-95 for the countries of Central Asia. For the first time,  
   South Africa has been extended coverage under ITEC; 60 civilian training  
   slots have been allocated to nominees from South Africa during 1994-95.  
   Among the countries which are increasingly availing of civilian training  
   slots under ITEC are those from East Europe and the CIS countries. 
<br> 
<br>The Economic Division is also a nodal point for organising military  
   training to nominees from friendly foreign countries in Indian defence  
   institutions. Slots are offered either under ITEC or on a self-financing  
   basis; on an average 250 slots are offered under ITEC and 100 under the  
   Self-financing Scheme. Courses range from the prestigious one at the  
   National Defence College to relatively short-term, technical ones in the  
   Army, Navy and Air Force. 
<br> 
<br>Under the ITEC programme, projects (mostly of a pilot nature) with some  
   financial outlay are executed in partner countries; 
    
   among other things, such projects serve as demonstration models  
   highlighting India's technology and potential in specific areas. Under  
   execution are Vocational Training Centres in Vietnam and Mongolia, Solar  
   Photovoltaic Plants in Oman and Cuba, a Remote Sensing Centre in  
   Mauritius and a Mobile Eye Clinic in Ghana. 
<br>-111&gt; 
<br><br>Execution of feasibility studies/extension of consultancy services in  
   partner countries are also undertaken under ITEC. Among other things,  
   such activities also facilitate enhanced economic and commercial  
   interaction between India and the partner country concerned. Among the  
   feasibility studies being undertaken at present are a road  
   rehabilitation project in Mauritius and a Technical Training Institution  
   in Kazakhstan. 
<br> 
<br>Based on specific requests from partner countries, Indian experts are  
   sent on deputation abroad under ITEC to assist, particularly in  
   developmental activities and infrastructure building. At present, there  
   are 34 experts from India deputed (for periods of more than one year) in  
   various countries in areas as varied as agriculture, education,  
   engineering, medicine, taxation, oceanography, etc. 
<br> 
<br>Study visits by delegations consisting of senior officials, mostly of a  
   decision making capacity, from partner countries to India are also  
   organised under ITEC. Apart from providing a first hand exposure of  
   India's capabilities in select areas, in particular, agriculture, agro- 
   industries and small scale industries, such visits also facilitate  
   chalking out concrete areas of cooperation. Around 8 study visits to  
   India, including from Ghana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Egypt and Yemen, are among  
   those planned for 1994-95. 
<br> 
<br>A major initiative undertaken under Prime Minister's instructions and  
   guidance through the ITEC programme was the elaboration and launching of  
   a programme for cooperation with select African countries for the  
   development of small scale industries (SSI) in these countries. The  
   objective of the SSI programme is the improvement of quality of life of  
   the people of these countries, bulk of whom live in rural areas and  
   creation of new job opportunities in both rural and urban areas.  
   Important aspects of SSI Programme include effective mobilisation and 
    
   utilisation of resources, creation of grass-root entrepreneurs, regional  
   dispersal of industrial development, conservation and generation of  
   foreign exchange and creation of complementarities in rural  
   industrialisation. The Plan sets out legislative and institutional  
   arrangements to be put in place in the target countries along with a  
   detailed programming strategy and financing package.
   <br>-112&gt; <br>    
<br>The action proposed for India seeks to ensure success and viability of  
   the programme through the following: 
<br> 
<br>(i) Concentration on select group of countries, i e ', three members of  
   the G-15, Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe, and a few others which today  
   have policies that encourage the involvement of the private sector- 
   Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and Ethopia; 
<br> 
<br>(ii) Information gathering on all aspects of the existing infrastructure  
   and policy in target countries; 
<br> 
<br></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td>(iii) Preparation of feasibility studies to clearly establish areas that  
<br>need to be covered; 
<br> 
<br>(iv) Assistance in the setting up of Entrepreneurship Development  
   Centres, multi-purpose technical and vocational training centres and  
   common facilities centres; 
<br> 
<br>(v) Assistance in the establishment of ancillary units and/or consumer  
   goods units; 
<br> 
<br>(vi) Assistance in the establishment of training programmes of managers,  
   entrepreneurs, skilled workers and marketing system; and 
<br> 
<br>(vii) help in the establishment of services support system. 
<br> 
<br>Government of India would offer to finance aspects of the actual  
   implementation of the specific programmes under ITEC. The emphasis of  
   such financing would be on promoting private entrepreneur-led  
   industrialisation thus ensuring the viability of the entire SSI  
   programme. An inter-ministerial committee headed by Secretary in the  
   Prime Minister's Office is to oversee the progress in the implementation  
   of the programme. A special programme for SSI-related cooperation with  
   South Africa is separately being developed in order to put India's  
   economic cooperation with that country on a new substantive footing with 
    
   a view to contributing to the development of post-apartheid South  
   Africa. 
<br>-113&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The SCAAP programme is aimed at providing technical assistance by India  
   to 15 African countries which are ex-colonies of UK. Activities under  
   SCAAP are directed at extension of training to nominees from these  
   countries in Indian institutes. In 1994-95, a total of 475 slots to  
   nominees from the SCAAP region-mainly from Ghana, Nigeria, Mauritius,  
   Tanzania and Zambia-were allocated under SCAAP. 
<br> 
<br>Apart from ITEC, SCAAP, etc, a new dimension was attempted to be given  
   to India's policy of South-South Cooperation through the Special  
   Volunteers Programme (SVP). The SVP envisages the sending of special  
   volunteers to developing countries in Africa and Asia to assist them in  
   their development programmes. Ten countries in Asia and Africa were  
   identified as target countries initially and Indian Missions abroad were  
   requested to assess the response of these countries to the SVP. Based on  
   careful analysis of these responses, the Committee on SVP discussed the  
   revision of target countries in Asia and Africa and their expansion to  
   include Central Asian Republics. It was also decided that the areas in  
   which the volunteers could be sent to assist the developing countries  
   could be left to the choice of the receiving countries. Indian Missions  
   in the revised list of target countries have been requested to obtain  
   the response of the countries of their accreditation to the SVP. 
<br> 
<br>During 1994-95, India continued to extend disaster relief assistance to  
   countries afflicted with calamities like earthquake, flood, epidemics,  
   etc. Among the countries for which disaster relief assistance has  
   been/is being extended include Armenia, Tanzania, Mozambique,  
   Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Rwanda, Somalia, Madagascar, Djibouti, etc.  
   Mauritius, for example, was extended relief assistance when it was  
   affected by a cyclone in 1994. Such humanitarian gestures strike a  
   positive chord amongst the people of these countries and create goodwill  
   for India.

    Historic and fundamental changes have taken place over the last few  
   years in the world economic, political and strategic situation. In the  
   economic sphere, one of the most important forces shaping current  
   developments today is the emergence of a truly global economy. India's  
   economic reform programme reflects her response to the changes sweeping  
   across the world and her determination to build an economy that is  
   internationally competitive and integrated into the global economy. In  
   recognition of this fact and the fact that the economic dimension of  
   state power is becoming increasingly important in determining the nature  
   of international relations, the Ministry has been attaching increasing  
   importance to the economic content of India's foreign policy. In the  
   year under review, the Ministry continued to accord high priority to the  
   promotion of India's economic and commercial interests. In close liaison  
   with the concerned economic Ministries, the Ministry was actively  
   involved, both directly and through Indian Missions and Posts abroad, in  
   projecting India's economic potential and capacity with the objective of  
   promoting trade, technology and investment flows and intensifying  
   linkages with the global economy. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry of External Affairs is following a multi-pronged strategy  
   in promoting India's economic and commercial interests. In the first  
   instance, close attention is given to the economic and commercial  
   aspects by all its territorial Divi- 
   sions at Headquarters in the development of bilateral relations. This is  
   done by way of monitoring economic and commercial developments,  
   servicing Joint Commissions, participation in bilateral consultations on  
   economic and commercial issues both at governmental and non-governmental  
   level, and assistance to the formulation of bilateral agreements and  
   treaties on economic and commercial matters. In addition to this, there  
   are specialised Economic Units/Divisions coordinating with the  
   territorial Divisions as well as all the other Ministries involved in  
   trade and investment promotion. The Economic Coordination Unit (ECU) is  
   the nodal unit for coordinating investment promotion activities with  
   economic Ministries, India's Missions and Posts abroad and associations  
   of trade and industry. The trade promotion arm of the Economic Division  
   plays a similar role on the trade promotion side.
<br>-115&gt; 
<br> 
<br>In pursuance of the decision by Government of India to entrust the work  
   relating to investment and trade promotion abroad to Indian Missions and  
   Posts, an officer has been designated in each Mission abroad to handle  
   such work. Missions have built up a wide network of contacts with local  
   industry associations, business leaders, economic journalists and other  
   opinion makers in order to keep them apprised of the Government's new  
   economic policies, their progressive evolution and the business  
   opportunities therein. In addition to economic bulletins, press releases  
   and newsletters, several Missions are using computer networks, data- 
   bases and electronic media to disseminate this information. 
<br> 
<br>Missions and Posts have been organising investment promotion seminars on  
   a regular basis, especially in important business centres in Europe,  
   Japan, South-East Asia, USA and the Gulf. Speakers at such seminars have  
   included Ministers/senior Government officials, representatives of  
   Reserve Bank of India and leading financial institutions, management  
   consultants, tax experts and captains of Indian industry. Among  
   countries that received special attention in 1994-95 were Japan,  
   Germany, Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Italy and USA. The Indo-British  
   Partnership Initiative, involving close co-operation between the two  
   Governments as well as trade and industry in the two countries, was  
   extended for a second year with the objective of further publicising and 
<br>-116&gt; 
<br> 
<br>promoting opportunities for collaboration between the two countries. 
<br> 
   In collaboration with concerned Ministries and industry associations,  
   the special emphasis placed on a sector-specific approach was continued,  
   with special attention being paid to the economic strengths and  
   complementarities of the various "target" areas vis-a-vis the Indian  
   economy. Indeed, close coordination with Chambers of Commerce and co- 
   opting the private sector in such efforts, formed a key component of the  
<br>Ministry's investment promotion exercise. 
<br> 
<br>On the trade front, sectoral and fact finding delegations were  
   encouraged and facilitated to explore and develop new target markets  
   like those of South Africa, Israel, CIS countries and South East and  
   East Asia. Individual exporters are assisted as well in their search for  
   information on markets. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry of External Affairs is an active participant in inter- 
   Ministerial meetings to promote India's exports, including project  
   exports to new markets. The Ministry is represented in the Inter- 
   Ministerial Committee (IMC) chaired by the Ministry of Commerce to  
   approve overseas investments. The recommendations of Missions/Posts  
   regarding Indian joint ventures abroad form a vital part of the  
   decisions taken in IMC meetings. They are also important inputs in  
   formulation of strategies for increasing India's project exports by the  
   Committee of the Overseas Construction Council of India (OCCI), of which  
   Ministry of External Affairs is a member. Indian Missions and Posts have  
   succeeded in securing several important projects for Indian companies in  
   countries like Lebanon, Nigeria, Tanzania, Vietnam, etc. The Ministry is  
   also actively represented on the High-Level Committee for exports and  
   has contributed constructively to policies formulated for promoting  
   exports to target countries and meeting the needs of small and medium  
   exporters.

<tr><td>The Ministry of External Affairs provides comprehensive back-up support  
   to its Missions and Posts for doing economic and commercial work. It  
   liaises closely with Missions and  
   Posts on the various promotional measures that need to be undertaken,  
   and in providing full support to these initiatives. These efforts are  
   especially focussed on those countries where the potential for  
   increasing trade and investment flows is the highest.
<br>-117&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Each of the Ministry's 14 9 Missions/Posts abroad has arrangement-s for  
   doing economic and commercial work. These arrangements have been  
   progressively strengthened: priority has been given to providing  
   Economic and Commercial Wings with the necessary infrastructure and  
   back-up support to aid them in the efficient execution of their  
   responsibilities. Officers posted to Missions undergo intensive  
   training; refresher courses are also arranged periodically at the level  
   of Commercial Representatives as well as Heads of Mission. 
<br> 
<br>Given the various economic policy changes that have taken place,  
   especially after the economic reforms, The Manual of Instructions to  
   Commercial Representatives (CRs) abroad, which was last prepared in 1967  
   was updated in April 1994 to cover the vast range of duties that a CR is  
   expected to perform in the present liberalised economic environment.  
   While work on the revision of the Manual was undertaken by a Committee  
   set up by Ministry of Commerce, crucial inputs were provided by  
   Commercial Representatives in Missions and Posts abroad. ECU assisted in  
   the areas relating to investment promotion. 
<br> 
<br>In order to ensure that the information database available in the  
   Economic and Commercial wings of Missions and Posts is up-to-date,  
   floppy diskettes containing information on the Indian economy,  
   compilations of export and trade directories, handbooks of industrial  
   statistics, etc are regularly supplied to them by Ministry of External  
   Affairs. Missions and Posts are being kept regularly informed about  
   important changes in economic policies and procedures so that they, in  
   turn, can keep business, industry and other sections of targeted  
   audiences in host countries suitably informed. The Ministry of External  
   Affairs also sends a weekly summary to Missions of important economic  
   events in collaboration with PTI. 
<br>-118&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Special despatches and market surveys received from Missions/Posts are  
   summarised and disseminated among apex chambers of commerce and industry  
   and concerned export promotion councils. Tender notices received from  
   Missions abroad are promptly circulated among concerned Indian agencies. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry of External Affairs also provides Missions and Posts full  
   back-up support in terms of expediting 'responses to specific queries  
   arising out of business contacts and obtaining information from  
   concerned economic Ministries and Chambers of Commerce in India. In  
   addition, it coordinates programmes for visiting business delegations  
   from foreign countries. High-level visits are utilised to arrange direct  
   contacts between Chief Executive Officers of important foreign companies  
   and decision makers in Government of India, both in the host countries  
   as well as in India. 
<br> 
<br>Trade facilitation functions of the Ministry also include attention to  
   commercial disputes: Missions/Posts abroad, chambers of commerce and  
   Indian companies are assisted in attempts to settle commercial disputes  
   by closely pursuing these with concerned agencies.

   IITF'94, International Seminar on Mineral and Mineral-based Industries  
   in ESCAP Region'94, MANTECH'95, IETF'95, AGROEXPO'95, Gifts and  
   Handicrafts Fair'95 and 22nd World Marketing and Management Congress'95.  
   Brochures and other information pertaining to these Fairs were  
   despatched to all Missions/Posts which were actively involved in  
   obtaining participation from foreign companies and Government agencies.  
   The Ministry was actively represented in the Committees and inter- 
   Ministerial meetings coordinating these Fairs. Important international  
   fairs abroad were also publicised and brought to the attention of apex  
   chambers, industry. associations and exporters, and advice and  
   assistance regarding Indian participation in these fairs extended to  
   concerned Ministries/agencies. 
<br>-119&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Special efforts were made in co-ordination with the External Publicity  
   Division to reach out to business journalists in foreign countries by  
   arranging their visits to India in order to enable them to see at first  
   hand the changes in the business environment and report on it in the  
   local media of their own countries. 
    
<br><br>With a view to making a more effective projectioneof India's new  
   economic policies, ECU invited leading advertisement agencies in the  
   country to submit concepts and make detailed presentations on the  
   subject. After a detailed examination of the various concepts presented,  
   the Ministry of External Affairs in coordination with the Ministries of  
   Finance, Commerce and Industry selected an approach that most closely  
   fitted the ideas which needed to be conveyed. The messages were released  
   in Singaporean newspapers on the occasion of Prime Minister's visit in  
   September 1994 and followed up in regional publications and other  
   magazines. 
<br> 
<br>A 12-page flier presenting the salient features of India's economic  
   reforms introduced by India and her various advantages as a country to  
   invest in was produced by ECU and used first during Prime Minister's  
   visit to the United States in May 1994. 
<br> 
<br>In November 1994, ECU published 10,000 copies of a set of six brochures,  
   "India Means Business" for distribution through Indian Missions and  
   Posts abroad. In addition to information on the economic profile of the  
   Indian economy, these brochures contain useful information on trade,  
   investment ' the financial sector, the size of the market and  
   opportunities in specific sectors. 
<br> 
<br>ECU also published 20,000 copies of a composite brochure entitled  
   "India-Business Perspectives" in collaboration with a professional  
   management consultant, containing up-to-date information on the  
   regulatory environment, incentives for foreign investment, banking and  
   finance, the Indian Tax System, Company Law and Accounting. 
<br> 
<br>Information on the Indian economy and the business environment is also  
   being made available on floppy diskette, with 

   ECU linking up with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), one  
   of India's premier economic research organisations. The material will be  
   constantly updated by means of a quarterly revision of the contents.
<br>-120&gt; 
<br> 
   Two slide packages have been prepared in collaboration with CII and  
   ASSOCHAM to assist Missions in projecting the new economic policies. To  
   supplement this material in industrialised countries, a special computer  
   aided visual package has been prepared in collaboration with the  
   Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India , (ICICI). 
<br> 
<br>All this material has been produced with a view to distributing it to  
   targeted audiences of foreign businessmen through Indian Missions and  
   Posts abroad, economic Ministries and apex Chambers of Commerce. They  
   incorporate inputs received from virtually every single Ministry in the  
   Government of India involved in the investment and trade promotion  
   exercise.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>The occasions of the Prime Minister's visits to the UK, Russia, USA,  
   Vietnam and Singapore, as well as visits by Ministers and prominent  
   economic personalities were utilised to highlight the opportunities for  
   economic collaborations and business tie-ups and all assistance rendered  
   with regard to the business components of such visits. For instance, in  
   the course of the Prime Minister's visit to Singapore in September 1994,  
   a total of 12 agreements were signed between Indian and Singaporean  
   companies in diverse fields including aquaculture, food processing,  
   banking, commercial office complexes, EDI services, LPG terminals, mini- 
   townships, shipbreaking, third country trading and warehousing. The  
   agreements gave Indian companies access to state-of-the-art technology  
   from Singapore with buy-back arrangements in certain cases. Some  
   projects also involved collaboration in third countries. 
<br> 
<br>Among the more important events coordinated for visiting economic  
   delegation by ECU were the visits of the Yamashita 
<br>-121&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Economic Mission despatched by the Government of Japan in March 1994;  
   the Korean Economic Mission in May 1994 and the Hong Kong Trade  
   Development Council (HKTDC) delegation in August 1994. 
<br> 
<br>The Yamashita Mission was the second economic mission sent to India by  
   the Government of Japan after the launch of India's liberalisation  
   programme and was a follow-up to the visit of the Ishikawa Mission in  
   January 1992. The main purpose of the Mission was to arrive at ways and  
   means by which trade and investment between India and Japan could, be  
   stepped up. 
<br> 
<br>A Korean delegation was sent by the Government of Republic of Korea in  
   follow-up to a proposal made during Prime Minister's visit there in  
   September 1993. The delegation consisted of representatives from  
   Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Construction, Trade, Industry  
   and Energy. There were also representatives from Korea's Economic  
   Planning Board and the Korea Development Institute. 
<br> 
<br>The Hong Kong Business Mission was jointly sponsored by the Hong Kong  
   Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and the Hong Kong Indian Chamber of  
   Commerce and consisted of leading Hong Kong businessmen, both Chinese as  
   well as Indians. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry arranged substantive interactions for all these delegations  
   with senior Ministers and officials in concerned Ministries as well as  
   representatives of Indian trade and industry. The visits resulted in a  
   positive appreciation by these delegations of the progress achieved by  
   India on the economic front and optimistic prognostications for  
   heightened interest by their trade and industry in the opportunities  
   that India has to offer. 
<br> 
<br>In addition to these Missions, high-level interactions with panels of  
   Secretaries to Government of India were arranged by the Ministry for  
   several other visiting economic delegations as well, especially those  
   accompanying foreign dignitaries. Such interactions were organised,  
   inter alia, for delegations from Germany, France, Kuwait and Republic of 
<br>-122&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Korea. Other foreign business delegations visiting India, whose  
   interactions with apex chambers were facilitated, were from Kuwait,  
   Vietnam, Russia, Uzbekistan, Slovakia, South Africa, Israel, Thailand,  
   Indonesia, Uganda and Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry was also closely involved in various investment promotion  
   seminars organised in India by other Ministries as well as apex chambers  
   and other economic organisations. Prominent among these were INVESMART  
   organised in April 1994 by Ministry of Industry in collaboration with  
   UNIDO. What made INVESMART different from other investment fora  
   organised in the past was the fact that the entire forum was focussed on  
   promoting 250 specific projects identified in six specific sectors by  
   Ministry of Industry. Indian Missions and Posts were actively involved  
   in promoting INVESMART and ensuring good participation from countries  
   such as France, Italy, UK, USA and Singapore. The success of the forum  
   can be gauged by the fact that about 70 Letters of Intent relating to  
   the identified projects were signed' in the course of INVESMART between  
   Indian entrepreneurs and foreign collaborators. 
<br> 
<br>Another important initiative was the "Seminar on Trade and Investment  
   Opportunities in Uganda" which was held in Bombay in September 1994. The  
   Ministry, through the Bank of Baroda, organised the one-day seminar in  
   Bombay which was inaugurated by the President of Uganda. Prior to the  
   seminar, on the request of the Ugandan Investment Authority, the  
   Ministry also sent an expert from FICCI under the ITEC programme to  
   Kampala to assist the Ugandan authorities in the logistics of the  
   seminar.

<tr><td>The Ministry of External Affairs accorded high priority to work  
   related to Policy Planning. The Policy Planning and Research Division  
   accordingly was revitalised and the Division prepared numerous papers on  
   a wide range of subjects relevant to the formulation of India's foreign  
   policy. The papers consisted of immediate reaction to unfolding  
   international events as well as policy notes on issues of medium and  
   long term interest. They contributed to discussion and decision making  
   on the issues concerned. 
<br> 
<br>The Division extended partial financial assistance to institutions in  
   different parts of India conducting seminars and conferences on  
   international issues of relevance to India's foreign policy. During the  
   period under review, assistance was extended to seminars/ conferences on  
   various subjects including aspects of India's foreign policy,  
   Pahchsheel, 50th Anniversary of UN, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Sri Lanka,  
   Latin America, South Asian region, human rights, South East Asia, China,  
   Africa, etc. It also extended financial support to academic institutions  
   and scholars to enable them to conduct studies and research on subjects  
   relevant to this Ministry. 
<br> 
<br>One important task of the Division is to edit and publish the Annual  
   Report of the Ministry on the basis of the material received from the  
   various Divisions in the Ministry. 
<br>-124&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The Division rendered assistance to the territorial Divisions and the  
   Indian Missions abroad on issues relating to India's international  
   boundary or whenever any specific information or documents on  
   international relations were required. 
<br> 
<br>Whenever international boundaries of India were incorrectly depicted in  
   maps printed in foreign publications (both official and private), the  
   Policy Planning and Research Division scrutinised them and evaluated the  
   extent of the error and the implications thereof in consultation with  
   the concerned territorial Divisions. The incorrect depictions and the  
   correct positions were pointed out and conveyed to the publishers  
   through Indian Missions to enable them to take necessary corrective  
   measures. 
<br> 
<br>The Division also coordinated the Ministry's approval of new maps  
   brought out by the Survey of India depicting international boundaries of  
   India. It also processed requests of various Government or semi- 
   Government agencies for supply of restricted map-sheets required for use  
   in their official work in consultation with the Survey of India and the  
   Ministry of Defence. 
<br> 
<br>The Division handled the requests from research scholars for access to  
   the closed records of the Ministry in the National Archives of India  
   relating to the restricted areas as per the Access Rules in consultation  
   with the territorial Divisions concerned. It also scrutinised excerpts  
   of the closed period records taken by research scholars for clearance in  
   consultation with the concerned territorial Divisions. 
<br> 
<br>The Division undertook review/weeding of old files referred to it by the  
   Record Management Section of the Ministry and the Indian Missions  
   abroad. It also reviewed old records of the Ministry which were  
   transferred to the National Archives of India. 
<br> 
<br>The Division coordinated the distribution of periodical reports received  
   from Indian Missions abroad. 
<br> 
<br>To support the research efforts, a library equipped with modern  
   facilities and large resource material is maintained 
<br>-125&gt; 
<br> 
<br>with over one hundred thousand books and documents in its collection.  
   The Library subscribes to 600 periodical titles. 
<br> 
<br>The Library is equipped with in-house computer system with 12 terminals  
   two of which support data entry and retrieval in Indian languages; a CD- 
   ROM Drive and CD-ROM databases on foreign affairs and current affairs; a  
   microfilm/fiche reader printer; a plain paper photocopier and a VTR and  
   colour monitor. A Laser Printer with DTP software is also available and  
   is being utilised for producing documents of the Division. 
<br> 
<br>Documentation/Bibliographic Services as well as other library operations  
   and services were computerised using an integrated software package  
   developed in India. Information about books and selected periodical  
   articles received in the Library since 1986 is available on-line through  
   each terminal. All new documents received in the Library-books, maps,  
   microforms, selected articles from periodicals, etc-are being fed into  
   the in-house computer system to create Database on Foreign Affairs.  
   Using this Database and CD-ROM Databases, the Library provides Current  
   Awareness Service as well as Bibliographical and Reference Services. In  
   addition, the Library regularly issues a monthly Chronicle of Events, a  
   Foreign Affairs Documentation Bulletin and an annotated monthly list of  
   Recent Additions to the Library. 
<br> 
<br>Library users including research scholars have access to on-line  
   computer-based information held in the Library in different Databases,  
   including CD-ROM Databases, through Foreign Affairs Information  
   Retrieval System (FAIRS). Photocopying and Computer Print-out facilities  
   are also available to all Library users including research scholars. 
<br> 
<br>The Division has, during 1994-95, continued with the work of publishing  
   India's bilateral treaties and agreements. While three volumes covering  
   the period from August 1947 to December 1960 were published in January  
   1994, in the current year three more volumes covering treaties and  
   agreements signed by India during the period January 1961 to December  
   1970 have been published. These volumes of India's bilateral 
<br>-126&gt; 
<br> 
<br>treaties/agreements serve as useful reference material and have been  
   greatly appreciated by scholars of international relations.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>Fundamentally, external publicity is the pursuit of foreign policy  
   objectives by the purposeful presentation of news and views through the  
   mass media with a view to preparing public opinion in a manner in which  
   diplomatic objectives are favourably received. It is the task of the  
   External Publicity Division (XP Division) to disseminate news about  
   developments pertaining to India's external affairs within India, to  
   project India and her views and concerns on national and international  
   issues externally, and to acquaint people abroad about developments in  
   India in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres with  
   particular reference to issues which have a bearing on India's external  
   relations and foreign policy. Information projection is therefore. a  
   vital tool in the implementation of foreign policy. 
<br> 
<br>External publicity consists of both long-term image-building as well as  
   current or topical publicity. Image-building is concerned with the  
   projection abroad of a consistent and coherent image of India designed  
   to enlarge the area of positive perception of India and build up a  
   greater awareness of, and understanding for India and her values and  
   policies. Longterm publicity priorities focus largely on areas of  
   perennial interest, and unique, and/or enduring features of India such  
   as her luminous history, her rich civilisation, her ethnic, linguistic  
   and cultural variety, her diverse and profound religious and  
   philosophical traditions, her democratic and secu- 
<br>-128&gt; 
<br> 
<br>lar political culture and institutions, her pluralistic, tolerant and  
   accommodative social ethos, her wide experience in nation building and  
   her impressive economic and technological achievements. 
<br> 
<br>The function of current publicity is to explain and interpret India's  
   foreign policy objectives and actions and gain acceptance and support  
   for them. It seeks to ensure the positive reportage of topical matters  
   concerning India and highlight areas where India enjoys a certain  
   'comparative advantage'. Of late, this has meant an intensification of  
   publicity of India's new economic environment and policies. But current  
   publicity also includes an element of countering negative or adverse  
   publicity either due to lack of information or motivated disinformation  
   and propaganda, or due to differing perceptions, interpretations and  
   misunderstanding of certain developments. Bearing in mind the reality of  
   a market place of information, however imperfect, and the principle of  
   freedom of opinion and information intrinsic to India's democratic  
   system, it has been the endeavour of the External Publicity Division to  
   counter unfair and biased reportage by transparency, and to project a  
   balanced perspective through the mainstream media and other opinion- 
   making channels so that negative developments are seen in perspective,  
   and influences and initiatives contrary to India's interests are not  
   allowed to prosper. 
<br> 
<br>The Division performs five principal functions. Firstly, it sets the  
   policy framework, and guides and supervises the functioning of the  
   information and publicity wings of all Indian Missions and Posts abroad  
   now numbering 149. 
<br> 
<br>Secondly, in its key function as the office of the official spokesman of  
   the Government of India on all matters pertaining to India's external  
   affairs, it strives to orient the domestic and international media on  
   India's external affairs perspectives and on topical issues through  
   regular briefings, public relations efforts, interviews with key  
   government and non-government figures, etc. 
<br> 
<br>Thirdly, the Division performs a broad information 'supply' or 'service'  
   function for Indian Missions abroad to enable 

    
   them to discharge their press, information and publicity duties more  
   effectively. Material is supplied in print as well as audiovisual  
   formats covering news and features and encapsulating topical as well as  
   perennial issues and subjects. While some material is produced or  
   commissioned by the Division, most of it is acquired or adapted from  
   other sources, governmental as well as non-governmental. The Division  
   has a particularly close working relationship with the information  
   bodies attached to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting such as  
   Doordarshan, All India Radio, Directorate of Film Festivals, Photo  
   Division, Press Information Bureau Directorate of Advertising and Visual  
   Publicity and others on whom it is dependent to a considerable extent  
   for its information material and services. 
<br>-129&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Its news dissemination function includes press releases and statements  
   issued by the spokesman, news bulletins sent out to the majority of  
   India's Missions and Posts abroad on a twice-daily basis, and a limited  
   newspaper clipping service on external affairs coverage from the  
   national media for the senior-most levels of the Ministry and for Indian  
   Missions abroad. Over 400 press releases/statements were issued by the  
   Division this year which are being compiled and brought out for  
   information and record purposes on a quarterly basis. Another  
   compilation of visits, agreements and other significant diplomatic  
   developments, the 'Foreign Affairs Record' is being brought out on a  
   monthly basis. 
<br> 
<br>With regard to features and other information material, the Division  
   commissioned or procured articles, publications, feature films and  
   documentaries on film and video, transparencies, photographs, floppies  
   and other publicity material for distribution to Missions and Posts on a  
   regular basis and on special commemorative occasions such as  
   Independence Day 1994, the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of  
   Mahatma Gandhi, and Republic Day 1995. Twenty-nine new documentary  
   programmes, six of them in 16mm/35mm film format also, were acquired  
   from government and independent sources and distributed to Missions.  
   Some of these have been telecast on foreign television networks through  
   Indian Missions. Over 40 Missions arranged telecasts on the occasion of  
   Indecent- 

    
   dence Day 1994. Some 20 Indian Missions brought out special supplements  
   in local newspapers on the occasion also. Four fresh TV programmes were  
   offered to Missions for use on Republic Day 1995. Thirty-seven new book  
   titles, 4 new magazines, and over 500 new transparencies on various  
   aspects of India especially the economy, were also acquired and  
   distributed to Missions and Posts abroad.
<br>-130&gt; 
<br> 
<br>A special effort was undertaken to help Missions observe the 125th birth  
   anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Vithalbhai Jhaveri's classic 13-reel  
   documentary on the Mahatma was acquired in film and video form and  
   circulated to Missions. Several sets of photographic exhibition on  
   Gandhiji consisting of 50 historic photographs are being circulated to  
   Missions to commemorate the anniversary during the course of the year.  
   Books, photographs and other Gandhi souvenirs have also been made  
   available to Missions for the occasion. Several Missions have held  
   special functions including seminars, many attended by local  
   dignitaries, brought out special supplements in local newspapers and/or  
   arranged telecasts of films on Gandhiji to mark the occasion. An  
   exhibition on Pandit Nehru was also organised in Colombo. 
<br> 
<br>On the production side, the Division completed a previously commissioned  
   film on the doyen of Indian classical music, Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur,  
   a video film on Sufi traditions in India and their linkages with Central  
   Asia, a video programme on the progress of India's economic reforms over  
   the last year and two video programmes on the status of women in India.  
   Spanish and Arabic versions of an earlier video programme entitled,  
   'India-Continuity in Change' were also brought out. Documentaries in  
   film and video previously produced by the Division also received wide  
   circulation and exposure. 
<br> 
<br>As regards new publications, the Division brought out a second volume of  
   'Muslims in India' in continuation of its previous highly successful  
   publication on the same subject with a view to highlighting the  
   contribution of Indian Muslims in various facets of national life. A  
   French version of this book is under preparation. Speeches delivered by  
   Prime Minister during his visits to the USA, Russia and Singapore have  
   also 

    
   been printed and distributed to Missions. Compilations of speeches by  
   Prime Minister on foreign policy since 1991 are also under production. A  
   booklet entitled, 'The Kashmir Story', and a reprint of an earlier  
   publication, 'Pakistan: Abetting Terrorism in Kashmir' were also  
   produced to counter motivated disinformation and propaganda in Kashmir,  
   rebut specific false allegations by presentation of correct information,  
   and to put the overall situation in Kashmir in a proper perspective. A  
   reprint of 'India-Continuity in Change' and a Turkish edition of the  
   same are also under production. Similarly, the Division is also printing  
   the 'Vienna Convention on Human Rights' in Hindi for distribution within  
   the country in order to increase awareness of the contents of this  
   important convention amongst citizens of India. The demand for the  
   Ministry's flagship publication, 'India Perspectives', now printed in 10  
   languages continues to grow. Fifty thousand copies of this monthly  
   magazine containing a lively mix of articles on all facets of life in  
   India accompanied by illustrations and photographs are distributed  
   through Indian Missions abroad. 
<br>-131&gt; 
<br> 
<br>As part of its entertainment and cultural publicity work, the Division  
   helped organise the presentation of over 100 Indian feature films drawn  
   from the XP Division, the Directorate of Film Festivals and the National  
   Centre for Children's Films at over 30 films events/ festivals organised  
   by and through Indian Missions abroad. The Division also assisted in the  
   organisation of the 1995 India International Film Festival and the  
   Bombay International Documentary Film Festival held in Bombay. As part  
   of its ongoing programme of developing a comprehensive library of Indian  
   film classics covering popular, mainstream and art cinema, the Division  
   also acquired four feature films by the legendary director, Ritwik  
   Ghatak. For the first time, subtitled VHS copies of films of Shyam  
   Benegal and Guru Dutt not officially released in cassette form were  
   negotiated with producers /distributors and distributed to Missions. It  
   also helped facilitate the telecast in select countries abroad of  
   popular Indian TV serials. Further, the Division assisted Missions in  
   processing their requirements of satellite dish antennae, video  
   projectors, TVs and VCRs, and other equipment necessary for effective  
   information work, through the Ministry. 
<br>-132&gt; 
<br> 
<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>The Division's fourth major function is to monitor, with the help of the  
   information wings of Indian Missions abroad, international media  
   coverage on India and issues of special interest to India so as to be  
   better able to respond to recognisable trends and distortions and take  
   suitable corrective action. Of special importance in this connection  
   were the international perceptions and reportage on the progress of  
   India's economic reform programme, developments relating to India's  
   neighbourhood, human rights and the plague in 1994. 
<br> 
<br>Lastly, the Division undertakes an active public relations programme for  
   the resident as well as visiting foreign media, and organises the media  
   component of India's VVIP visits abroad, and of foreign VVIPs visiting  
   India. As part of the ongoing programme of inviting foreign journalists  
   to acquaint themselves first-hand with India, XP Division hosted 40  
   journalists from nearly 30 countries during the year mainly from  
   economically advanced countries, the Islamic world, and India's  
   neighbours. Journalists from Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Spain,  
   Greece, Sudan, Bangladesh and China were amongst those covered under  
   this programme. The Division also rendered assistance to over 30 other  
   foreign journalists from different parts of the world visiting India on  
   their own. These visits succeeded to a considerable degree in generating  
   goodwill and promoting a more balanced picture of India abroad. 
<br> 
<br>As the nodal agency responsible for media arrangements during visits of  
   Heads of State and Government XP Division facilitated coverage of events  
   in India by media teams who accompanied the President of Mongolia, the  
   President of Poland, the President of Uzbekistan, the President of  
   Argentina, the Prime Minister of Slovak Republic, the President of  
   Burkina Faso, the President of Togo, the Prime Minister of Russia, the  
   Prime Minister of Singapore ( to Calcutta ), the President of South  
   Africa, Nelson Mandela ( on the occasion of Republic Day, 1995 ) and the  
   President of Turkey to India during the year. It also arranged media  
   coverage for the incoming visits of the UN Secretary General, and the  
   Vice President of Suriname, and for visiting Foreign Ministers and  
   important dignitaries from several other countries. XP Divi- 
 
    
   sion also looks after media arrangements for VVIP visits abroad such as  
   those relating to the visits of the President to Romania and Bulgaria,  
   the Vice President to Australia, South Africa and China, and the Prime  
   Minister to USA, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam. Besides this,  
   assistance was rendered to Indian Journalists going abroad on specific  
   assignments. The Division also facilitated media coverage for  
   journalists covering the G-15 and Education for All summits in 1994.
<br>-133&gt;
<br> 
<br>XP Division also serves as a facilitation centre for foreign journalists  
   based in, or visiting India. It assists Ahem in getting accreditation as  
   journalists, and facilitating their visas and their extension. News  
   organisations such as AP Television, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,  
   AP Dow-Jones Services, etc opened new India-Bureaus. The Division also  
   liaises with other Government Ministries and Departments to process and  
   facilitate proposals for the making of documentary programmes by foreign  
   producers in India. Approximately 125 such proposals were cleared during  
   the year. 
<br> 
<br>Changes in the international media scene have required corresponding  
   changes in publicity apparatus, strategy and techniques. The world-wide  
   information revolution has resulted in much faster communication and  
   news reportage than ever before. It has become necessary for the  
   Ministry to be linked with Missions as speedily as possible. Information  
   retrieval within India, especially in crisis situations, has to keep  
   pace with the swiftness of international news dissemination so that  
   authentic and authoritative information is obtained and projected  
   immediately. The reaction time of administrators and policy makers to  
   unexpected developments has been greatly curtailed. To meet this  
   challenge the External Publicity Division is gearing up its  
   communications technology by moving to an integrated use of  
   communication by fax and computers as a first step, and eventually to  
   link all Indian Missions by E-mail and other advanced computer-related  
   information technologies. 
<br> 
<br>New media technologies and channels have also emerged. New means of mass  
   communication such as satellite and cable television, E-mail, CD-ROMs  
   and interactive. video, information highways and computerised data banks  
   and data pro- 
<br>-134&gt; 
<br> 
<br>cessing, and digital imaging and recording have supplemented traditional  
   mass media such as print media, radio, terrestrial television and film.  
   The mushrooming of communication and broadcasting satellites, and the  
   combination of media, information and communication technologies are  
   eroding the power of states to regulate the flow of news, information  
   and reportage. It is recognised that publicity efforts should exploit  
   the positive potential of established as well as emerging media  
   technologies and channels of information, as each medium has its own  
   segment, characteristics, appeal and impact. The territorial reach and  
   penetration of phenomena like satellite, community and cable TV and  
   computer-linked E-mail networks need to be tapped. 
<br> 
<br>New publicity and public relations strategies are also being adopted in  
   an effort to keep pace with the changing scenario. Newspaper and  
   magazine space is being used more effectively through support for  
   supplements brought out in foreign periodicals, and through  
   professionally crafted advertisement campaigns placed in prominent  
   international newspapers and periodicals. A new campaign promoting India  
   as an economic and business destination finalised in association with  
   the Economic Coordination Unit was launched formally during the visit of  
   the Indian Prime Minister to Singapore in September 1994, with  
   advertisements in two of Singapore's leading newspapers and the Far  
   Eastern Economic Review. These advertisements were also published in a  
   special supplement on India brought out by the 'Forbes' of USA and in  
   the European Edition of 'Newsweek'. The latter will be provided to  
   Indian Missions for local distribution and dissemination. The material  
   prepared for the Ministry of External Affairs was also utilised by the  
   Ministry of Finance in a special supplement on India in the 'Business  
   Week' of October 1994. Further, in line with the practice there,  
   professional lobbyists have been employed in USA to promote Indian  
   interests in policy-making circles. The Division also notes with  
   appreciation the independent efforts of Non-Resident Indians in USA,  
   Canada and Europe to project information and lobby the 'Indian'  
   viewpoint on crucial issues through the Email Internet network. 
<br>-135&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The nature and volume of media coverage of India has changed  
   significantly in recent times. While areas of adverse publicity remain  
   and are often occasioned or triggered by domestic events and  
   developments, the area of positive publicity has vastly improved.  
   Politically, the end of the Cold War and the progress in India's  
   dialogue with world powers, hand in hand with economic policies  
   facilitating India's greater participation in the global market, have  
   helped overcome political and psychological barriers of the past and  
   yielded an image of India as a more receptive economic, political and  
   strategic interlocutor. In terms of domestic policies, an increasing  
   acceptance of India as a genuine functioning democracy has been  
   accompanied by an appreciation of India's ability to contain and weather  
   formidable domestic challenges. Economically, the liberalisation  
   programme 'has been the single greatest factor behind the interest in  
   India shown by the international media. Though some reservations  
   persist, the reaction to the reforms have ranged from cautious optimism  
   to outright enthusiasm. The liberalisation measures have been seen as  
   releasing hitherto suppressed economic and entrepreneurial energies, and  
   placed India amongst a select group of attractive investment  
   destinations and emerging markets. More than any other factor, these  
   policies, and the dynamic response of Indian business and industry to  
   the more competitive environment opened by it, have made a significant  
   dent on India's image as a casestudy in bureaucratic red-tape and under- 
   development, and introduced new images of India, such as those inspired  
   by India's software industry, as a potential centre of economic energy  
   and innovation. Culturally, contemporary trends in Indian writing, art,  
   dance, music and other art forms are drawing attention to India's  
   cultural resilience and establishing India as a force to reckon with in  
   the global cultural arena. 
<br> 
<br>India's response to negative reports and perceptions on Jammu and  
   Kashmir has been to remind the world about the correct historical  
   background leading to the unambiguous legal accession of Jammu and  
   Kashmir to India, the circumstances leading to the UN Resolutions on  
   Jammu and Kashmir, the reaffirmation and endorsement of this option by  
   the 
<br>-136&gt; 
<br> 
<br>people and political parties of Jammu and Kashmir through successive  
   elections held under the Indian Constitution and by the Constituent  
   Assembly, the non-fulfilment by Pakistan of crucial requirements under  
   the UN Resolutions resulting in its non-implementation and obsolescence,  
   and the supersession of the UN Resolutions with the signing of the Simla  
   Agreement enshrining a solemn commitment by India and Pakistan to sort  
   out all problems bilaterally.

<tr><td>The main focus during 1994 was reduction in backlog and time taken for  
   issue of a passport; systems review; and computerisation. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry's objective is to put into operation a system whereby  
   passports are issued within a reasonable time period and procedures  
   streamlined to provide quick and efficient service to the public. The  
   decline in pendency during the year has been sharp and is indicative of  
   the efficacy of the efforts made by the Ministry and the Passport  
   Offices. 
<br> 
<br>Pendency in issue of passports stood at 5,32,738 on 31 December 1993 and  
   applications pending over one month were 3,43,215. At the end of  
   December 1994, total pendency has come down to 2.8 lakhs and pendency  
   over one month is only 1.4 lakhs. Pendency over one month indicates the  
   real backlog with the Passport Office. 
<br> 
<br>The Passport Offices issued 20,11,404 passports during 1994 (January- 
   December). Miscellaneous services like renewals, change of names,  
   inclusion of child's name, emigration clearance not required (ECNR)  
   stamp, amounted in 1994 to 
<br>-141&gt; 
<br> 
<br>10,14,662 which is almost 50% of the issue of fresh passports. Detailed  
   input and output figures are at Appendix VI. 
<br> 
<br>A Passport Office was opened in Jammu on 31st March 1994. A colection  
   centre is operating in Srinagar. A colection centre will be opened at  
   Mangalore. 
<br> 
<br>Following measures for further systematisation and streamlining of  
   procedures were undertaken: 
<br> 
<br>(i) Requirement of Police verification/Verification Certificate is  
   dispensed with for 10-year renewal of passports. In cases where renewal  
   is sought at an office other than the office of original issue, renewal  
   is to be provided in thirty days from the date a reference was made to  
   the original office, even if confirmation is not received within this  
   period. 
<br> 
<br>(ii) A system of inspection, visits and personal follow-up have helped  
   tone up the passport offices and ensure they are more responsive to  
   public needs. 
<br> 
<br>(iii) To deal with the large number of complaints and grievances from  
   the public, a senior officer in Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV)  
   Division meets the public to hear their grievances and complaints with a  
   view to seeking speedy redressal. The effort is to try and resolve the  
   complaints within a month. Similarly, all Passport Offices have  
   designated officials to meet the public in an attempt to provide  
   redressal to the problems of the public. 
<br> 
<br>(iv) Computerisation of Passport Offices has been speeded up. Apart from  
   Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore, Passport Offices in Cochin, Goa, Kozhikode,  
   Madras, Tiruchy and Trivandrum will be computerised by the end of the  
   current financial year. During 1995, the remaining Passport Offices are  
   proposed to be computerised. Computerisation has led to a decrease in  
   the time taken for issue of a passport and retrieval of information  
   regarding pending applications. Computerisation of all Passport Offices  
   would result in speedier clearance of cases requiring prior authorisation from another Passport Office.Machine writing of passports is also under examination in consultation  
   with NIC. This would eliminate inaccuracies in the writing of passports  
   and also reduce the time taken for issue of a passport.
<br>-142&gt; 
<br> 
<br>(v) Passports are issued on priority provided, applicants furnish  
   documentary proof of urgency, in cases involving career/business  
   opportunities, medical reasons, study abroad, death, marriage of  
   son/daughter. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry worked in close consultation with various law enforcement  
   agencies on matters concerning passport fraud. There are ongoing efforts  
   to produce more secure passports by the India Security Press, Nasik. 
<br> 
<br>The Regional Passport Offices in Delhi, Cochin and Bangalore moved to  
   more spacious, and modern premises. In Kozhikode, Madras, Goa and  
   Hyderabad, new properties have been located and are in various stages of  
   construction/completion. In Jaipur and Lucknow, plots of land have been  
   identified for purchase. In Bareilly and Chandigarh, discussions have  
   been initiated for new sites. It is believed that improvement in the  
   work environment and the facilities available would result in greater  
   productivity in the Passport Offices. It would also make the premises  
   more user-friendly. 
<br> 
<br>As a measure of providing convenience to the public, sameday services  
   have been started by the Passport Offices in Delhi, Bombay, Bareilly,  
   Patna, Trivandrum, Madras, Cochin and Hyderabad for services of 5-year  
   renewal, ECNR, inclusion/deletion of child's name and change of address.  
   This same-day service would be extended to other metropolitan cities. 
<br> 
<br>Inter-ministerial discussions have been completed regarding Machine  
   Readable Visa Stickers. Production is expected to commence early in the  
   next financial year. 
<br> 
<br>Price Waterhouse and CMC have been commissioned to do a systems review  
   of the working of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO). M/s Price  
   Waterhouse submitted the final 
<br>-143&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Report in January 1995 which is under examination. CMC's final Report is  
   awaited and will be similarly examined. 
<br> 
<br>Departmental Promotion Committees (DPCs) were held to empanel officers  
   for promotion to the posts of Superintendent, Assistant and UDC.  
   Recruitment Rules for some of the Group C and D posts have been framed.  
   Amendments to the existing Recruitment Rules to Group A posts have been  
   proposed and are awaiting approval of the Union Public Service  
   Commission. 
<br> 
<br>Consular work with regard to Indian nationals abroad continued to be an  
   area requiring constant attention. Indians in Rwanda and Yemen were  
   evacuated to India due to internal problems in those countries. Indian  
   Missions in Kampala, Sana'a, Aden and Djibouti rendered assistance to  
   these persons by issuing them duplicate travel documents and arranging  
   for their transportation back to India. On return to India they were  
   given an amount of Rs 2,000 per person to help tide over the emergency.  
   The affected persons have undertaken to repay the cost of transportation  
   and the financial assistance given to them. 
<br> 
<br>Missions abroad provide assistance to Indians in settling differences  
   with local employers, repatriation of destitute Indians, maintaining  
   contacts with Indians in foreign jails, assisting with formalities for  
   Indians who have died abroad, either in the performance of last rites or  
   return of the dead body to India. 
<br> 
<br>Figures regarding various categories of cases where consular services  
   were provided in India and abroad may be seen at Appendix VIII. 
<br> 
<br>Agreements are under consideration with several countries for transfer  
   of convicted persons. 
<br> 
<br>There are nearly 14 million overseas Indians spread over the world. This  
   figure includes Indian citizens settled abroad as also persons of Indian  
   origin who have taken foreign citizenship. Government is sensitive to  
   the emotional urges and cultural bonds that overseas Indians have with  
   India as also  
   to their deeply felt desire to nurture their roots in the mother  
   country. Government makes every effort to remain informed about the  
   wellbeing of Overseas Indians. 
<br>-144&gt; 
<br> 
<br>A section of the overseas Indians have sought grant of dual citizenship.  
   This has not been found acceptable. Efforts are, however, being made to  
   examine ways in which, the linkages with overseas Indians can be  
   strengthened.

<br>The Ministry now has 149 resident Missions/Posts abroad. 
<br>-146&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The total strength of IFS and IFS(B) at Headquarters and in Missions  
   abroad is 3490 (Details are at Appendix X). This includes certain posts  
   borne on the budget of the Ministry of Commerce but excludes ex-cadred  
   posts. The list of officers qualified in various foreign languages is at  
   Appendix XI. The statement showing the number of appointments (both by  
   direct recruitment and promotion) made in various groups in the Ministry

   during the year 1994 is at Appendix XII. 
<br> 
<br>In keeping with the instructions contained in the Second Report of the  
   Standing Committee of Parliament on External Affairs, the Ministry  
   assessed its requirements of property in India and abroad and drew up a  
   comprehensive plan for purchase and construction of property, with a  
   view to meeting all its requirements, that was proposed to be  
   implemented in a period of 10 years, beginning with 1995-96. However,  
   because of the current budgetary constraint, the financial authorities  
   have expressed their inability to sanction funds required for  
   implementation of this plan. The Ministry shall remain in touch with  
   these authorities. As and when they are in a position to sanction the  
   requisite funds, a suitably modified plan, in the light of the  
   circumstances prevailing at that stage, shall be put into effect. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry continued its efforts to purchase built-up property within  
   the available budgetary resources. Properties were purchased in Berne (4  
   residential units), Pretoria (Chancery building and Embassy Residence),  
   Durban (Consul General's Residence) and Bangkok (3 residential units).  
   Other property purchase proposals under active consideration pertain to  
   the Missions/Posts at Kiev, Vancouver, The Hague, Wellington and  
   Frankfurt. These will be finalised subject to fulfilment of financial  
   and administrative requirements as also availability of funds. Approval  
   of the Cabinet was obtained for renewal of the lease of the Residence of  
   the Indian High Commissioner in London for a period of 65 years. 
<br> 
<br>Special attention is being given to repair and maintenance of government  
   owned properties abroad. 
<br>-147&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Construction work started on the Riyadh project (Chancery, Embassy  
   Residence and 44 residences) in May 1994 and is expected to be completed  
   in 20 months. Contract for construction of the building of the Indian  
   Cultural Centre in Mauritius is expected to be awarded by 31 March 1995.  
   Construction of building of the Foreign Service Institute in the old JNU  
   Campus is expected to begin in July/August 1995. The Passport Office in  
   Cochin has shifted to its newly constructed premises. The Passport  
   Office, Delhi was shifted to its new premises in the Trikoot complex,  
   Bhikaji Cama Place. The building of the Passport Office in Kozhikode is  
   under construction. Other construction projects under process relate to  
   the Missions in Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Brasilia, Dhaka, Islamabad,  
   Kathmandu, Muscat, Moscow; the ICCR complex at Calcutta, construction of  
   the Ministry's office building on Janpath, housing projects at  
   Papankalan and Chanakyapuri, as also construction of Passport Office  
   Complexes at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Panaji. Implementation of the  
   above projects would depend upon fulfilment of administrative and  
   financial requirements and availability of budgetary resources. 
<br> 
<br>In pursuance of its policy to computerise its offices in India and  
   abroad, the Ministry sanctioned purchase of additional computer  
   hardware. A pilot project to introduce E-Mail link with 13 Missions was  
   initiated. The Ministry's offices at South Block are proposed to be  
   brought under a centralised computer network. 
<br> 
<br>In order to assess the functioning of Indian Missions abroad, Foreign  
   Service Inspectors inspected Missions in Brussels, Kiev, Minsk, Tel  
   Aviv, Nicosia, Athens, Moscow and Malta. Some additional Missions in  
   Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America are expected to be inspected by  
   the end of 1994-95.

   abroad attended the basic' Professional Course which covers all aspects  
   of functioning in Missions abroad. As part of this Course, two short  
   courses on computer appreciation, word processing and data base  
   management were organised so as to enable the participants to  
   familiarise themselves with modern office management tools and  
   techniques. 
<br> 
<br>Based on the language need of the country of posting five language  
   courses were also arranged for IFS (B) personnel, two each in French and  
   Arabic and one in Russian. Language tapes and books have been provided  
   on demand and individual officials and their families have taken  
   advantage of the facilities available in the Language Laboratory.  
   Special English coaching classes have also been ar I ranged for the  
   participants of the PCFDs. 
<br> 
<br>A Familiarisation Programme for Resident Foreign Diplomats in Delhi was  
   held in the current year. A total of 24 diplomats from 19 countries and  
   two UN Organisations attended the same. 
<br> 
<br>The Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats (PCFD) arranged by the FSI  
   has become popular over the years. The 
<br>-150&gt; 
<br> 
<br>course design covers the following areas: Diplomatic Practice and  
   Protocol; International Relations; International Economic Relations;  
   Implementation of Foreign Policy; Management Skills; Representational  
   skills; Communication Skills; and Computer Appreciation. The Fourth and  
   Fifth PCFDs were held this year. In the Fourth PCFD which laid stress on  
   Economic Diplomacy, there were eighteen participants from seven  
   countries (Poland, Slovakia, Uzbekistan, Russia, Belarus, Turkmenistan  
   and Kazakhstan). The Course was held from 15 March to 19 April 1994. The  
   Fifth PCFD which was held from 19 September to 2 December 1994 was  
   attended by 19 diplomats from the following countries : Azerbaijan,  
   Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Zambia, Poland,  
   Lithuania, Armenia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Laos, Slovakia, Russia,

<tr class="evenRow"><td>Like previous years, this year too the Ministry endeavoured to  
   implement the Official Language Policy of the Government of India and  
   also to propagate Hindi abroad. The Official Language Implementation  
   Committee headed by Joint Secretary (Administration) continued to review  
   the implementation position of Official Language Policy in the Ministry.  
   Official Language Committees were set up in several Indian Missions  
   abroad during the year. 
<br> 
<br>During the year under review, a Hindi module for the Indian Foreign  
   Service probationers of the 1993 Batch was organised. With a view to  
   creating an atmosphere conducive to use of Hindi in official work, a  
   Hindi Week was observed and various competitions organised at  
   headquarters as well as in some Indian Missions abroad and Passport  
   Offices in India. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry made translation arrangements for two weeks during 49th  
   Session of UN General Assembly to help the members of Indian delegation. 
<br> 
<br>The Ministry continued to be actively engaged in the propagation of  
   Hindi abroad. Besides sending sets of Standard Hindi literature and  
   teaching aid material including text books, audio cassettes, charts,  
   dictionaries, etc to a large 

    
   number of Indian Missions abroad, the Ministry extended all possible  
   help to foreign universities, educational institutions and individuals  
   engaged in promotion of Hindi through Indian Missions abroad. During the  
   year 1994-95 Hindi typewriters/computer softwares were provided to  
   foreign institutions/individuals and Indian Missions in Vietnam, Russia  
   (St Petersburg), New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Hungary. There was  
   noticeable increase in demand from, predictable areas but requests for  
   Hindi books and teaching aids were also received from places like  
   Tehran, Vladivostok, Odessa, The Hague, Colombo, Kathmandu, Havana, etc.  
   Indian Missions in Buenos Aires, Budapest, Ulaan Baatar, Seoul,  
   Paramaribo, Port of Spain, London and Port Louis continued to play a  
   major and significant role in propagation of Hindi abroad in the  
   countries of their accreditation. The High Commission of India, London  
   organised Kavi Sammelans in Manchester and London which were attended by  
   poets from India, namely Neeraj, Ramnath Awasthi, Kanhaiya Lal Nandan

</tr><tr class="evenRow"><td>The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR, henceforth referred  
   to as the Council) was formally set up in 1950, with the primary  
   objective of establishing, reviving and strengthening cultural relations  
   and mutual understanding between India and other countries. Its aims as  
   enunciated in the Memorandum of Association are: 
<br> 
<br>(i) to participate in the formulation and implementation of policies and  
   programmes relating to India's external cultural relations 
<br> 
<br>(ii) to foster and strengthen cultural relations and mutual  
   understanding between India and other countries 
<br> 
<br>(iii) to promote cultural exchange with other countries and peoples 
<br> 
<br>(iv) to establish and develop relations with national and international  
   organisations in the field of culture 
<br> 
<br>(v) to take such measures, as may be required, to fur- 
   ther these objectives. 
<br> 
<br>The major activities of the Council include: 
<br> 
<br>administration of scholarship schemes on behalf of the Government of  
   India for international students; exchange of scholars, academics,  
   opinion makers, artistes and writers; exchange 

    
   of exhibitions; organisation of and participation in seminars and  
   symposia; exchange of performing arts groups; establishing and  
   maintaining Chairs and Professorships for India Studies abroad;  
   presentation of books; organising Annual Maulana Azad Memorial Lectures  
   and the Maulana Azad Essay competitions; providing the secretariat for  
   the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding;  
   publications; maintaining Indian Cultural Centres abroad and supporting  
   special bilateral programmes. 
<br>-154&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Scholarships and Welfare of International Students 
<br> 
<br>The Council attaches considerable importance to its scholarships  
   programmes, as it is a critical input to greater people-to-people  
   contact and hence, an integral part of India's foreign policy. Every  
   year, a large number of foreign students come to India, mainly on self- 
   financing basis. The Council offers around 1000 scholarships every year  
   under its various scholarship schemes, principally to nationals of  
   developing countries. After their studies here, many of these students  
   occupy positions of influence and importance in Government, industry and  
   the civil services, on their return to their countries. There are at  
   present international students from around 70 countries on scholarships  
   who are studying in different universities and educational institutions  
   in India and pursuing a variety of courses from undergraduate studies to  
   doctoral degrees in the social sciences as also professional subjects  
   such as Engineering, Medicine, etc. The total number of international  
   students under various ICCR scholarships is 1792. 
<br> 
<br>From this academic year onwards, the Council has instituted a new  
   scholarship in the memory of the late Appa Saheb Pant, the first  
   Commissioner of India in Kenya. The scholarship has been awarded to a  
   Kenyan student. 
<br> 
<br>The Okita Memorial Scholarship has also been instituted at the request  
   of the family of the former Japanese Foreign Minister, the late Dr S  
   Okita, recipient of the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and  
   Development in the year 1993. The scholarship is being awarded to a  
   meritorious Indian student. 
<br>-155&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The Council celebrated the birth anniversary of its founder, Maulana  
   Abul Kalam Azad on 11 November as 'International Students Day'. Special  
   get-togethers and cultural programmes of international students and  
   Indian students in Delhi and at various universities all over the  
   country were arranged on the occasion. Indian Missions in Africa, South  
   East Asia and elsewhere also organised special functions to mark the day  
   by inviting former alumni of Indian Universities. This helps maintain  
   links with former alumni. 
<br> 
<br>The welfare of all international students is the responsibility of the  
   Council. The Council deputed various officers during the year to visit  
   different institutions and to meet the heads of these institutions to  
   solve their problems. To further regular interaction with the  
   international students, the Council has decided to bring out a news  
   letter from this year onwards which would not only report on some of the  
   activities of the international students but also highlight the  
   activities of the Council. 
<br> 
<br>Performing Arts 
<br> 
<br>The major highlight this year of the presentation of India's composite  
   and rich culture abroad has been the Festival of India in China (3 to 22  
   May 1994). Some of the other major events in which the Council  
   participated during the year were 'India Today 1994' (21 April to 2 May  
   1994) in Australia, which was a month-long event inaugurated by the Vice  
   President of India, the exclusive commercial exhibition organised by  
   India Trade Promotion Organisation in Moscow (18 to 27 July 1994), the  
   India Trade Fair at St Petersburg (5 to 11 August 1994), India in Dubai  
   (17 to 23 September 1994), the 125th Death Anniversary Celebrations of  
   Mirza Ghalib in Mauritius (12 to 18 September 1994) and the 'India  
   Night' at Alter Opera, Frankfurt (24 September 1994). 
<br> 
<br>During April-December 1994, the Council sponsored the visits of a number  
   of cultural troupes abroad, details of which are given at Appendix XXII.  
   During the same period, the Council also facilitated/organised  
   performances by a number of incoming delegations, details of which are  
   at Appendix XXIII. Finally, the Council organised several Indian cul- 

    
   tural programmes in honour of visiting delegations/VVIP functions.  
   Details of such programmes are at Appendix XXIV.
<br>-156&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Exhibitions 
<br> 
<br>On the occasion of 125th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the  
   Council organised a major exhibition in Japan titled 'Ashoka-Gandhi- 
   Nehru-The Healing Touch' for display at the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum in  
   October 1994. The exhibits reflect the Ashokan period, the lives and  
   times of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru and their philosophy of  
   humanism, pacifism and non-violence. Other exhibitions organised by the  
   Council during April to October 1994 are the exhibition of Indian  
   Children's Paintings (Republic of Korea) and the Children's Paintings  
   (Cairo). The Council also presented busts of Gandhiji and Gurudev  
   Rabindranath Tagore. Details about such presentation of busts and the  
   exhibitions are given in Appendix XXV. 
<br> 
<br>Visitors Programme 
<br> 
<br>During April-December 1994, the Council sponsored and assisted 45 Indian  
   Scholars, intellectuals, academics and artistes to participate in  
   seminars, symposia, study tours, etc abroad, the details of which are at  
   Appendix XXVI. The Council received 78 visitors from 11 countries as per  
   details indicated at Appendix XXVII 
<br> 
<br>International Symposium on India Studies 
<br> 
<br>The Council was the Secretariat for the International Symposium on India  
   Studies (ISIS) which was organised from 28 November to 2 December 1994  
   at Kovalam in Kerala. 
<br> 
<br>The Symposium was inaugurated by the Prime Minister at Kanakakunnu  
   Palace, Thiruvananthapuram, Trivandrum on 28 November 1994. The Governor  
   and the Chief Minister of Kerala attended and adressed the inaugural  
   function. 
<br> 
<br>A National Organising Committee was set up by the Prime Minister, Patron  
   of the Symposium, to work out arrangements for the Symposium with the  
   eminent scholar-philosopher Prof K Satchidananda Murty, as its Chairman. 
<br>-157&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The aims of the Symposium included (a) taking a critical review of the  
   achievements and current work in studies relating to India (ancient,  
   classical, medieval and contemporary) in all its aspects, (b)  
   encouraging discovery of new 
   dimensions of Indian life and thought, and (c) attempting to suggest new  
   directions for such studies so that they become more comprehensive,  
   multi-disciplinary and relevant for understanding the actualities that  
   constitute present-day India. The idea of the Symposium was conceived  
   during the visit of the Prime Minister to Germany. It reflected the need  
   to encourage Indology studies and to give an impetus to an understanding  
   and appreciation of modern India through India studies. 
<br> 
<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>Special Issue of the Council's English language quarterly, 'Indian  
   Horizons', titled Indian Realities and especially brought out on the  
   occasion of the Symposium, was presented to the Prime Minister by Prof K  
   Satchidananda Murty. 
<br> 
<br>Thirty-one scholars from various parts of the world including Australia,  
   Belgium, China, France, Germany, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico,  
   Poland, Russia, UK and USA participated in the Symposium along with  
   their counterparts from India. 
<br> 
<br>All participants said the Symposium was a landmark event in area of  
   India Studies and in promoting a holistic understanding of India. The  
   Symposium closed with the unanimous recommendation that a permanent  
   International Society of India Studies under the Chairmanship of Prof  
   Satchidananda Murty be set up to monitor and coordinate activities  
   related to India Studies worldwide and to act as a clearing house for  
   information and ideas. 
<br> 
<br>Cultural Centres Abroad 
<br> 
<br>India's foreign policy has a cultural dimension for promoting greater  
   people-to-people contact and an appreciation of India's cultural  
   heritage. The Council has set up cultural centres in Georgetown  
   (Guyana), Jakarta (Indonesia), Moscow (Russia), Port Louis (Mauritius),  
   Paramaribo (Suriname), Cairo (ARE), Berlin (Germany), London (UK),  
   Tashkent (Uzbekistan) and Almaty (Kazakhstan). 
<br>-158&gt; 
<br> 
<br>The activities in the Cultural Centres reflect the perceived and felt  
   needs of the local population. The Centres with the exception of the  
   ones in Berlin and London impart lessons in Indian music, dance, yoga  
   and languages. All Centres have libraries and reading rooms, organise  
   lectures, symposia, exhibitions, essay competitions, performances ' of  
   dance and music, staging of plays, screening of films and publication of  
   news bulletins. The Centres are expected to develop and maintain  
   contacts with a wide cross-section of local citizens, including  
   students, teachers, scholars and cultural personalities. While some  
   Centres focus principally on the resident Indian population and help  
   them maintain and strengthen cultural links with India, other Centres  
   target the intelligentsia and opinion makers to project a holistic  
   picture of India's rich and diverse cultural heritage. 
<br> 
<br>Visiting Professors and Chairs of India Studies Abroad 
<br> 
<br>The Council deputes visiting Professors abroad to teach Indology, Indian  
   Languages and other related subjects. The deputation of Professors  
   abroad is principally done under the bilateral Cultural Exchange  
   Programmes, as also where there is a specific institutional arrangement  
   with the Council. ICCR presently has several Professors abroad teaching  
   Indian languages, Indology and allied subjects as per the list at  
   appendix XXVIII.
