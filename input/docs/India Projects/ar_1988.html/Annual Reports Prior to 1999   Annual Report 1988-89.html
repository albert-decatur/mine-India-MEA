      INTRODUCTION 
      <br><br>THERE was a marked improvement in the international climate during 
      the year. Confrontation gave way to dialogue presaging a trend 
      towards a saner, safer world. Both globally and regionally, issues 
      that in previous years. contribute d to tension, seemed nearer 
      solution. The emergence of detente between, the, Soviet Union and 
      the United States which had resulted in the INF Agreement raised the 
      expectation of further important steps towards nuclear disarmament. This 
      emerging detente also set in motion the process of conflict 
      resolution in diffe rent parts of the world. The joint statement 
      signed in Moscow by President Gorbachev and President Reagan in June 
      1988, expressly affirmed their "intentio n to continue US-Soviet 
      discussion at all levels aimed at helping, parties to reg ional 
      conflicts find peaceful solutions which advance their independence, 
      freedom and security". Among the more important regional 
      developments were the Geneva Accord's on Afghanistan, the Agreements 
      on Angola and Namibia and the prospect of a solution to the Kampuchean 
      issue. The ceasefire in the war betwe en Iraq and Iran held out 
      the hope for a lasting peace between them. The bold initiative of the 
      PLO brought nearer the prospect of a just international solut ion 
      to the Palestinian issue. Hopes were also raised for the restoration 
      of peace in Central America. India welcomed these positive trends 
      in world affairs with particular gratification as, it had, 
      unilaterally and, through the fora of the Non- Aligned Movement 
      and, the United Nations pressed for nuclear disarmament and also 
      sought a peaceful settlement of these regional issues. The growing 
      recognition of the interdependence of the modern world and the dawning 
      realisation that the peace, freedom and prosperity of all nations i s 
      interlinked provided the objective basis for this positive trend. But 
      the rapi dity with which the international scene was transformed 
      was also due to the bold initiatives of Soviet President Gorbachev; 
      the "new thinking" in Soviet foreign policy acknowledges that it 
      relies for its philosophical underpinning on the November 1986 
      Delhi Declaration and the ideals of Non-alignment. <br><br>(iii) It 
      may be recalled that the "Delhi Declaration of Principles for a 
      Nuclear Weapon-Free and Non-Violent World" had expounded core 
      principles that should govern international relations, including 
      peaceful co-existence, the supremacy of human life, non-violence, 
      understanding and trust, the right of every State to political and 
      economic independence and a nuclear weapon-free and non-violent world. 
      The Non-Aligned Movement had long been urging a return to detente. The 
      "Delhi Six" had also suggested pract ical steps to promote the 
      process of disarmament. At the Third Special Session on 
      Disarmament at the UN General Assembly in June 1988, the Prime 
      Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, presented on behalf of India an Action 
      Plan calling for a binding commitment by all nations to eliminate 
      nuclear weapons by the year 2010 . <br><br>The Action Plan urged all 
      States to participate in the process of nuclear dis- armament to 
      demonstrate good faith and build the required confidence and to bring 
      about changes in doctrines, policies, and institutions to sustain a worl 
      d free of nuclear weapons. Soviet initiatives for reduction of 
      conventional forces on the principle of defence sufficiency have 
      further improved the prospects for turning swords into ploughshares as 
      advocated by the Conference on Disarmament and Development held 
      under the UN aegis in June 1988. The Conference in Paris on Chemical 
      weapons brought forth a rare degree of unanimity on steps to 
      proscribe these weapons of mass destruction also. <br><br>In 
      India's neighbourhood, the development of cooperation among Member 
      States of the SAARC and the successful conclusion of the Fourth Summit 
      in Islamabad underlined the growing awareness of the countries of 
      South Asia, of the similarity of most of the problems faced by 
      them and the need to solve them collectively. A highlight of the 
      Summit was the decision to prepare a regional perspective plan 
      entitled "SAARC 2000: A Basic Needs Perspective" which is to be an 
      aggregation of development targets set by individual Member States for 
      the turn of the century in core areas such as food, clothing, shelter, 
      educatio n, population planning and environmental protection. 
      Another noteworthy feature in the development of cooperation in 
      the SAARC during the year was the coming into effect of the 
      Agreement establishing the SAARC Food Security Reserve and the 
      SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. <br><br>The 
      emergence of democracy in Pakistan helped that country's leadership to 
      start looking at Indo-Pakistan relations from a more positive angle. 
      During his visit to Islamabad for the Fourth SAARC Summit, the 
      Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, had intensive discussions with his 
      counterpart Ms Benazir <br><br>(iv) Bhutto. Though Indo-Pakistani 
      problems which have existed for long, may not lend themselves to 
      instant solution, the affirmation by the Pakistani Prime Minister 
      to resolve all bilateral problems within the framework of the Simla 
      Agreement has come as a welcome prelude to the normalisation of 
      relations. The talks also culminated in the signing of three important 
      agreements namely: Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear 
      Installations and Facilities, Cultural Cooperation and Avoidance of 
      Double Taxation on income derived from International Air Transport. 
      Besides the visit of the President, Shri Venkataraman, to Pakistan 
      to attend the funeral of General Zia-ul-Haq, there were a number of 
      important Indo-Pakistan meetings at the level of senior officials. 
      <br><br>In Sri Lanka there was significant progress towards the 
      implementation of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement. The overwhelming 
      turn-out of the voters in the elections to the North-Eastern 
      Provincial Council in November 1988, under- lined the yearning of 
      the Tamils of Sri Lanka for a return to peace and normalcy. <br><br>With 
      the setting up of the Provincial Council Government, the institutional 
      framework for greater autonomy for the Tamils of Sri Lanka was in 
      place. In the southern part of Sri Lanka also the people displayed 
      their courage and commitment to democracy by defying terrorist 
      threats, to vote in the Presidenti al elections in December 1988. 
      Frequent exchange of visits between India and Sri Lanka underlined the 
      growing cordiality of relations between the two countries. <br><br>In 
      keeping with its good-neighbourly policy, India responded to appeals by 
      Bangladesh for international assistance to cope with the 
      devastating floods tha t inundated its territory in September 
      1988. The floods also underlined the continuing relevance of India's 
      long standing proposal for harnessing the Brahmaputra. This proposal 
      offers major flood protection and irrigation benefits. India 
      reiterated to Bangladesh its willingness to cooperate bilatera lly 
      in the field of flood control and optimum utilisation of river waters. 
      <br><br>During the year under review, as in the previous years, there was 
      no let-u p in the pace or degree of Indo-Nepal economic 
      cooperation. India continued to implement a number of economic 
      development projects in Nepal under its Aid Nepal Programme. The text 
      of the Indo-Nepal Treaty of Trade was initialled. <br><br>(v) The 
      Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, had wide-ranging discussions with 
      the King of Nepal, when His Majesty visited india in his capacity 
      as the then Chairman of SAARC. The important visitors form India 
      to Nepal were the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the minister for 
      External Affairs. The latter's visit was in connection with the 
      first meeting to the indo-Nepal Joint Commissi on. The 
      Commission's work is expected to result in identifying new areas of 
      cooperation. <br><br>Friendship and cooperation which traditionally 
      have been the hallmarks of Indo-Bhutanese relations continued to 
      be firm. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, visited Bhutan in 
      September. Fruitful discussions on subjects of mutual interest 
      were held. The President, Shri R. Venkataraman, paid a State visit in 
      October, During this visit, the President and the King of Bhutan 
      jointly inaugurated the Chukha Hydel Project, the largest and most 
      prestigious Indian aided project in Bhutan. <br><br>The, Foreign 
      Secretary, Shri K.P.S. Menon, had also visited Bhutan, earlier in 
      1988. From Bhutan, the Deputy Minister of Planning had visited 
      India twice in 1988 and the Bhutanese Foreign Minister in August. 
      Apart from other Indian aided hydroelectric projects, cooperation 
      also extends to the completion of a cement project in Eastern Bhutan 
      which is estimated to cost over Rs. 140 crores. <br><br>India 
      continued to assist Bhutan in fields such as education, civil aviatio 
      n, defence, customs, medicine and engineering. To strengthen 
      bilateral cultural relations, the two. Governments have agreed to hold 
      a Bhutan week in New Delhi , in March. India's commitment 
      to peace and stability in the region was reiterated whe n the 
      Government of, India. responded, to an appeal from, the democratically 
      elec ted Government of Maldives for military assistance to crush 
      an invasion by foreign mercenaries on Nov 03, 1988. <br><br>(vi) 
      The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to, China in December 
      1988, was a major event that provided a new vitality and impetus 
      to the development of India-China, relations. It was recognised 
      that the improvement of relations between the two countries would 
      not only be in the fundamental interest of the two peoples but be 
      a significant contributory factor to peace in Asia and the world 
      as a whole. The importance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existen 
      ce, jointly initiated by India and China, in the establishment of 
      a new internation al political order and the new international 
      economic order was emphasised. Determination was expressed by both 
      sides to settle the boundary question through peaceful and friendly 
      consultations and also to develop relations activ ely in other 
      fields. In a world where confrontation is giving way to dialogue and 
      tension to relaxation, friendly and durable cooperation between 
      India and China as two large countries of Asia, strengthens the 
      foundtions of peaceful co-exist ence and common progress and has 
      major implications for global peace and detente. <br><br>Afghanistan being 
      an area of great importance, India continued to take an active 
      interest in the developments in that country. The Geneva Accords on 
      Afghanistan signed in April 1988 was the first important step towards 
      a peacefu l political settlement of the Afghan problem. This also 
      led to the phased with- drawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. 
      India welcomed these Accords. It took a consistent stand that 
      Afghanistan should be sovereign, independent and non-aligned and 
      that the Afghans should be allowed to decide their future without 
      outside interference. President Najibullah's official visit to India 
      in May was significant in the context of I ndia's dialogue on the 
      Afghan problem with different shades of opinion. <br><br>India, maintained 
      good bilateral relations with Afghanistan. It pledged assistance 
      worth Rs. 10 crores for the relief and rehabilitation of the Afghan 
      refugees. Amid-term review meeting of the Indo-Afghan Joint 
      Commission on Economic, Technical, Trade and, Cultural Cooperation was 
      hold in Kabul in June. <br><br>Developments in Burma were a cause for 
      concern. It is hoped that the situation will be resolved soon in 
      accordance with the Wishes of the people of Burma. <br><br>(vii) 
      The ceasefire in the war between Iraq and Iran was warmly welcomed by 
      India. Fifteen Indian military officers have been deputed to serve 
      with the Un ited Nations Iran and Iraq Military Observer Group 
      established to monitor the cease- fire. Special envoys from Iraq 
      and Iran had visited India during the period under review to apprise. 
      the Indian leadership on developments concerning post- war 
      negotiation. An event of great significance in West Asia, was the 
      historic proclamation of an independent Palestine State on 15 
      November 1988 at the extraordinary Palestinian National Council 
      Session in Algiers. India was among the first countries to recognise 
      the State. This was in a sense, the culmination of the suffering 
      to which the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had bee 
      n subjected to, by the Israeli occupation authorities. The PLO 
      leader Yasser Arafat had visited India in October and he had been 
      assured of India's full support. <br><br>India is also gratified at 
      the start of direct US-PLO dialogue. It is hoped that the positive 
      trends in the region will lead to an early convening of an 
      International Peace Conference under UN auspices with the 
      participation of all the parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute 
      including the PLO as the sole legitimat e representative of the 
      Palestinian people. <br><br>The traditionally strong political and 
      economic relations between India and the Arab States were given a 
      fillip by the visit of the Prime Minister, Shri Ra jiv Gandhi, to 
      Syria and Jordan. Wide-ranging discussions on bilateral, regional 
      and international issues of common interest were held with the 
      leadership of these countries. The important visits from India to that 
      region were those of the Minister of State for External Affairs, 
      Shri K.K. Tewary, and of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shri Balram 
      Jakhar, to Egypt. The Minister for Commerce, Shri Dinesh Singh, 
      visited Cairo for the Indo-Egyptian Joint Commission meeting. 
      From the Arab countries, the Crown Prince of Jordan had come to 
      India in April 1988 as also the Egyptian Minister of State for 
      Scientific Research. Yet another visitor from Egypt was the 
      Minister of Education. <br><br>(viii) India maintained close 
      consultations and cooperation with Algeria. The Minister of State for 
      External Affairs, Shri K.K. Tewary, visited Tunisia in October. 
      <br><br>Diplomatic relations were restored between India and Morocco. 
      The visit of the Minister of State in the Ministry of External 
      Affairs, Shri K. Natwar Singh, to Oman in April 1988, and that of 
      the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri K.K. Tewary, 
      to Iraq to participate in the second I nter- national Babylon 
      Festival in Iraq, offered fora for meaningful discussions on 
      bilateral, regional and international issues. <br><br>There were 
      Ministerial level visits from Saudi Arabia and the People's Democratic 
      Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Shri Janak Raj Gupta, Member of Parliament 
      represented India at the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of the Yemeni 
      Revolution Day on 14 October. <br><br>Cordiality and a spirit of 
      cooperation continued to inform India's relatio ns with the 
      countries of South-East Asia, There were many exchanges of visits 
      leading to increased interaction in economic, commercial and other 
      fields. Amo ng the important visitors from that area were the 
      Foreign Minister of Indonesia, t he Prime Minister of Singapore 
      and the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the <p></p></td></tr>

      Government of the 
      Philippines. From India, besides the visit of the Minister for 
      Textiles, Shri Ram Niwas Mirdha to Singapore, a delegation from the 
      Confederation of Engineering Industries had also visited Singapore. 
      India maintained very cordial relations with the three Indo-China 
      States. <br><br>With Vietnam, the tradition of mutual visits at high 
      levels was kept up. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, paid a 
      one-day official visit to Vietnam in April 1988. At the invitation 
      of the Prime Minister, Mr Nguyen Van Linh, the General Secretary 
      of the Vietnamese Communist Party came to India as the Chief Guest at 
      the Republic Day celebrations. <br><br>(ix) The third 
      Indo-Vietnamese Joint Commission Meeting was held in New Delhi in 
      January. There was a thorough review of many cooperation projects and 
      of credits and grant assistance. Increasing flexibility and an 
      easing of tension in South-East Asia are contributing to the process 
      of negotiating a political solution to the Kampuche an problem. 
      India has been in close contact with the various parties to the confl 
      ict and has been seeking a political solution which ensures the 
      sovereignty, territ orial integrity and non-alignment of 
      Kampuchea. In this context, the visit of the Kampuchean Prime 
      Minister, Mr Hun Sen to India in November, and the visits of the 
      Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri K. Natwar Singh to Vietnam, 
      Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, especially his 
      meetings with Prince Sihanouk as the Prime Minister's Special 
      Envoy on Kampuchea, were very significant. <br><br>India also 
      worked through the forum of Senior Officials' Meetings of the 
      Non-aligned countries held in July and August to advance a peaceful 
      solution. The NAM has welcomed the Jakarta Meetings under 
      Indonesia's leadership. India's initiatives have been supportive of 
      the regional initiative. There was a marked increase in exchanges 
      with Australia in the fields of trade, science and technology, 
      mining, coal, agriculture, energy and railways. <br><br>India's 
      participation in the bicentennial celebrations of Australia, the signi 
      ng of a new Cultural Exchange Programme for the years 1989 to 
      1991, the eleventh meeting of the India-Australia Joint Trade 
      Committee in Canberra in May and the discussions held during the visit 
      of Mr John Kerin, the Australian Ministe r for Primary Industries 
      and Energy with his counterparts in India culminated in the visit 
      of the Australian Prime Minister Mr R.J.L. Hawke in February 1989. 
      The Third meeting of the Joint Business Council took place during 
      that visit. <br><br>The visit of Mr Hawke and his talks with Prime 
      Minister Rajiv Gandhi has given a new impetus to the relationship 
      in accordance with the desire expressed by b oth leaders during 
      Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to Australia in October 1986. Memo- 
      randa of Understanding in the fields of Railways, 
      Telecommunications and Meteorology were signed as well as one on 
      Concessional Financing of Develop- ment Projects. <br><br>(x) 
      India and New Zealand continued to maintain friendly relations. 
      The effects of the two military coups that had taken place in Fiji 
      in 1987 , continued to plague that country's political and social 
      life. The Interim Government in Fiji, approved the draft of the new 
      Constitution which denied equitable representation to the different 
      communities and which contained certa in provisions which were 
      undemocratic and discriminatory. <br><br>The Government of India besides 
      issuing a statement regretting the undemo- cratic and unbalanced 
      nature of the new Constitution, continued its trade ban w ith 
      Fiji. <br><br>India's relations with Japan in the economic, 
      commercial, cultural and scientific fields registered further 
      progress. During the year, Japan's Offici al Development 
      Assistance (ODA) to India was to the tune of Yen 87.9 billion which 
      made her the largest bilateral donor to India in gross terms. 
      President and Smt. Venkataraman, accompanied by the Minister for 
      External Affairs represented India at the funeral of the late 
      Emperor Hiro Hito of Japan on 24 February 1989. During his talks 
      with the Japanese and other leaders, the President noted the 
      widespread desire to foster the current improvement in the climate 
      of international relations. <br><br>The Festival of India was held in more 
      than 30 cities in Japan. This was inaugurated in Tokyo by the 
      Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi along with the Japanese Prime 
      Minister, in April 1988. The two Prime Ministers discussed bilateral 
      and international issues. Greater economic interaction between 
      India and the Republic of Korea (ROK) characterised their relations. 
      The Minister of Trade of ROK visited India and a meeting of the 
      India-ROK Joint Economic Council and a meeting of the Joint Business 
      Cooperation Committee were held in Seoul and in India respectively. 
      <br><br>India's relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
      (DPRK) were characterised by exchange of Ministerial visits. Premier 
      Li Gun Mo of the DPRK leading a delegation which included the 
      Minister of Foreign Trade visited India. An MOU was signed to 
      enhance bilateral trade. <br><br>(xi) The Speaker of the Lok Sabha, 
      Shri Balram Jakhar and the Minister for Urban Development, Smt. 
      Mohsina Kidwai, were the important visitors to DPRK. The 
      President, Shri R. Venkataraman, visited the Mongolian People's 
      Republic in July; the first ever Presidential visit from India. An 
      Agreement o n cooperation in Science and Technology and a Protocol 
      on Agricultural Research and Education were signed during the 
      visit. <br><br>As in the past, India continued to play a leading role at 
      the United Natio ns and other international for a in supporting 
      the struggle of the people of South Africa and the Frontline 
      States against apartheid and the violence unleashed by the racist 
      South African regime. <br><br>India which has been an ardent supporter of 
      Namibian independence, warmly welcomed the conclusion of the 
      Brazzaville Protocol which established a definite time frame for 
      Namibian independence. In this context, it is relevant to recall 
      the visit of the President of SWAPO to India in October, at the invitati 
      on of the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, to discuss various 
      issues relating to Namibia's transition to independence. India is 
      contributing personnel to the civilian component of the UN Transition 
      Assistance Group. <br><br>If the number of high-level visits is any 
      indicator, India's relations wit h the countries of Africa, South 
      of the Sahara marked a significant advance. Amo ng the 
      distinguished visitors were Mr Jose Eduardo dos Santos, the President of 
      Angola, Mr Wole Soyinka, the Nobel Laureate of Nigeria, as keynote 
      speaker at the Non-Governmental organization Conference "Towards a 
      Nuclear Weapon Free and Non-Violent World"; Mr Marcelino dos Santos, 
      the Chairman of the National Assembly of Mozambique; Mr Salim Ahmed 
      Salim, the Deputy Prime Minister of Tanzania; Mr Joaquim Alberto 
      Chissano, the President of Mozam- bique; Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo, the 
      Governor General of Mauritius; Dr Kiseka, the Prime Minister of Uganda 
      and Mr Peter Mmusi, the Vice-President and Minister of Finance and 
      Development Planning of Botswana. <br><br>(xii) Shri K.R. Narayanan, 
      Minister of State for Science and Technology, participated in the OAU 
      silver jubilee celebrations in Addis Ababa. The Vice-President of 
      India, Dr S.D. Sharma, visited Mauritius to parti- cipate in the 
      20th Anniversary celebration of the independence of Mauritius. As 
      Chairman of the AFRICA Fund, India played a key role in mobilising 
      public opinion and raising funds in UK, the continent and Japan. 
      Opportunities afforded in various international fora were utilised 
      to disseminate information on the objectives of and the progress 
      on the activities of the Fund. The Fourth meeting of the Senior 
      Officers of the Fund Committee was held in New Delhi from 14 to 17 
      February 1989. <br><br>There was considerable and wide-ranging interaction 
      between India and the West European countries covering political, 
      economic, commercial, scientific, technological and cultural 
      fields. The European Community continued to be India's biggest trading 
      partner. Greater meaning and content were imparted to those 
      interactions as a result of several high-level visits from India to and f 
      rom West European countries. It is expected that with the coming 
      into being of the Single Market in Europe in 1992, India's share 
      in the imports of the Community would increase. <br><br>The Prime 
      Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to the Federal Republic of 
      Germany in June, was the culmination of an on-going dialogue 
      between the two countries. Apart from holding talks with the top 
      leadership of the Federal Republic, the Prime Minister met with the 
      leaders of Germany's industrial and business circles. <br><br>The 
      other noteworthy visits of the Prime Minister were that to Spain and 
      Turkey, particularly to the former, on account of Spain's 
      membership of the European Community and the economic progress 
      achieved by it. The visit to Turkey was also significant in that, 
      apart from paying a return visit to that p aid <br><br>(xiii) by 
      the Turkish Prime Minister to India in 1986, it helped increase 
      Indo-Turkish interaction in the shipping, consular and economic 
      fields. The visit of Presid ent Evren of Turkey to India in 
      February 1989 helped give a political depth to the expanding 
      Indo-Turkish relations. <br><br>The State visits paid by the President, 
      Shri Venkataraman to the Netherlan ds, Finland and Cyprus, not 
      only helped consolidate political relations but also ga ve a 
      greater content to the economic relations between India and these 
      countries. The visit to Cyprus was also by way of affirmation of 
      India's interest in the preservation of the unity, integrity and 
      sovereignty of Cyprus. The visit of the Prime Minister of Malta to 
      India in January 1989 gave a fillip to the on-going process of 
      dialogue and cooperation between Malta and India through the fora of 
      the Non-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth and the United Nations. 
      The visit of President Mitterrand of France and his presence at 
      the inauguration of the Festival of France in India on 3 February, 
      further consolid ated the foundations of Indo-French relations in 
      the political, economic and scienti fic- technical fields. It is 
      recalled, that both India and France have more or loss identical 
      views on important issues like the North-South dialogue and 
      disarmament. <br><br>The Speaker of the Lok Sabha led Parliamentary 
      delegations to the European Parliament and to Turkey, while 
      Parliamentary delegations from the European Parliament, Cyprus, 
      Ireland, Austria and Spain visited India. Indo-Soviet and 
      Indo-East European relations not only remained stable, but also 
      generated considerable warmth primarily as a result of exchange of vis 
      its at the highest and other levels. <br><br>The President, Shri 
      R. Venkataraman, paid a State visit to the USSR in July. Besides 
      useful discussions with the Soviet leaders, he participated in th e 
      closing ceremony of the Festival of India in the USSR. <br><br>(xiv) 
      President Gorbachev during his visit to India in November participated 
      in the closing ceremony of the Festival (if the USSR in India. He 
      received the In dira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and 
      Development. Five agreements were signed. <br><br>The Minister of 
      State for External Affairs, Shri K. Natwar Singh also visited and had 
      useful discussions with the Soviet leaders. Following the 
      earthquake that devastated the Republic of Armenia in the Soviet 
      Union, a special fund, the "Prime Minister's Armenia Earthquake Relief 
      Fund" was opened. Considerable quantities of relief supplies were 
      airlifted to Armenia. <br><br>The notable visits to East Europe 
      were the visit of the President to Czechoslovakia in September and 
      that of the Prime Minister to Hungary and Yugoslavia in June and July 
      respectively. These occasions were utilised by the Indian leaders 
      to hold fruitful discussions with their counterparts. <br><br>Important 
      discussions and review of economic, trade, scientific and techn ical 
      cooperation took place during the meetings of the Indo-Romanian Joint 
      Commis- sion in Bucharest, and the Indo-Polish, the 
      Indo-Hungarian, and the Indo- Bulgarian Joint Commissions in New 
      Delhi. <br><br>A new dimension was added to cultural cooperation between 
      India and Bulgaria with the holding of the "Days of Indian Culture in 
      Bulgaria" in June, and the "Days of Bulgarian Culture in India" in 
      January 1989. Both the festiva ls evoked widespread enthusiasm in 
      the respective countries. <br><br>With the GDR, India signed the Cultural 
      Exchange Programme for the years 1988-89. A similar exchange programme 
      in the field of scientific and technical cooperation was also signed. 
      <br><br>(xv) Friendship and cooperation between India and Yugoslavia, 
      two of the important Non-aligned countries received a further fillip 
      with the visit of the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, to 
      Yugoslavia in July. Several agreements especially in the fields of 
      information, science and technology and sports were signed. 
      The 17th Session of the Indo-Yugoslav Joint Committee for 
      Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation which was held in June, 
      not only sought to maintain the tempo of growing cooperation but 
      also to identify new areas of cooperation. <br><br>Another important 
      development during the year was the revival of India's diplomatic 
      relations with Albania which had been under suspension earlier. 
      The year under review saw a further consolidation in Indo-US 
      relations. The initiatives taken during the Prime Minister's visit to 
      Washington in Octobe r 1987 were followed up. There was an 
      appreciable increase in the exchanges in the economic, scientific 
      and technological fields. Under the transfer of technology the 
      Cray XMP-14 Super Computer was delivered to India in October 1988 and 
      which was installed at the Indian meteorological Department in New 
      Delhi. The Government of India has applied for another Super Computer, 
      the Cray YMP-132 for the Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore. 
      The Science and Technology Initiative (STI) which was extended for 
      a three - year period beyond 1988 during the Prime Minister's 
      visit to USA in October 1987 was signed in October 1988. <br><br>The 
      developing Indo-US relations were also underlined by the exchange of 
      important visits between the USA and India. Among the notable 
      visits from the US were that of the Defence Secretary; the Chief of 
      the Army Staff; the Assistant Secretary of Defence; the Assistant 
      Secretary of State and the Chairm an of the US House of 
      Representatives Sub-Committee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. 
      <br><br>(xvi) During his visit to New York to attend the 43rd 
      Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for 
      External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimh a Rao met President Reagan 
      and the then Secretary of State Mr George Shultz. <br><br>Indo-Canadian 
      relations continued to be cordial. The Annual Ministerial 
      Consultations held in Canada in May 1988 covered the entire gamut of 
      Indo- Canadian relations besides identifying new areas of cooperation. 
      The Canadian Government took a firm line against terrorists 
      abusing Canadian laws in carryin g on their anti-Indian 
      activities. <br><br>The year under report was marked by a lively 
      interaction between India and the countries of Latin America and the 
      Caribbean. The main highlight was the visit of the Vice-President, 
      Dr S. D. Sharma, to Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad &amp; Tobago in 
      May. A large delegation including Members of Parliament led by the 
      Vice-President, represented India at the 150th Anniversary of Indian 
      arrival in Guyana. During his visits to the three countries, the 
      Vice-President held discussions with the Presidents and th e Prime 
      Ministers of these countries which included matters of bilateral and 
      international interest. <br><br>From Latin America, the important 
      visitors to India were the Foreign Minister of Guyana, the Speaker of 
      the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, 
      and the Governors of Cordoba and Negro in Argentina. The 
      Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri K. K. Tewary, represented 
      India at the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
      who was elected President of Mexico in July. Shri K. K. Tewary visited 
      Peru where he delivered a message from the Prime Minister to 
      President Garcia of Peru. He also represented India at the 30th 
      Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution in Havana on 2 January 1989. 
      In spite of the easing of tensions in Central America following 
      the Peace Accord signed by the five Central American Presidents in 
      August 1987, India showed concern for the situation. In May, India 
      co-sponsored a UN General <br><br>(xvii) Assembly Resolution on "The 
      Situation in Central America : Threats to Peace and International 
      Security and Initiatives for Peace and Special Programmes for 
      Economic Assistance". This co-sponsorship was deeply appreciated 
      by the countries of the area. The Joint Declaration of the Presidents 
      of El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua on 
      14 February 1989, has carried forward the peace process. As in 
      the past the Non-Aligned Movement played a crucial role in creating 
      a better international climate and contributed to the resolution 
      of some of the regional conflicts, particularly the Kampuchean 
      problem. <br><br>The Co-ordinating Bureau of NAM at its meeting in New 
      York in October condemned the inhuman Israeli practices in the 
      occupied Arab territories and supported the Palestinian cause. 
      The Movement continued to monitor developments regarding the inde- 
      pendence for Namibia and expressed indignation and concern at the 
      continued illegal occupation of Namibia by the South Africa regime. 
      At the NAM Foreign Ministers conference held at Nicosia in 
      September, the commitment to seek a solution to the financial crisis 
      faced by the UN was reiterated. It also called for the restructuring 
      of the present world econ omic order on the basis of equity and 
      justice. The role of the UN during the year 1988 in contributing 
      to the resolution of conflicts has been warmly welcomed by India. 
      These included the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan, the ceasefire in the 
      Iran-Iraq war and the Namibian and Angolan accords. On the Palestinian 
      issue the stage has been set for the UN to play a constructive 
      role. India continued to maintain that all Inter- national Peace 
      Conference on the Middle-East was necessary. <br><br>India continued its 
      active support for the UN and continued to play ail active role in it. 
      India also continued to play an active role in the Common- wealth 
      and also in the Non-Aligned Movement. Despite continuing efforts, 
      however, the lack of progress in the international economic field was 
      a matter of disappointment. <br><br>(xviii) There was no 
      change in India's principled stand regarding convening, of the 
      Conference on the Indian Ocean latest by 1990. India also maintained that 
      the great power naval presence in the Indian Ocean was 
      contributing to tension and instability. India voiced its 
      strong concern at the developments in South Africa and called for a 
      complete elimination of aparthied and reiterated its appeal for 
      imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist 
      regime of South Africa. India's Permanent Representative was 
      re-elected as Vice- President of the Council for Namibia. 
      India continued to play a prominent part in the main International 
      fora for disarmament namely, the Conference on Disarmament in 
      Geneva, the UN Disarmament Commission and the First Committee of the 
      UN General Assembly. The near unanimity achieved at the Conference on 
      Disarmament and Develop- ment under the UN aegis was a matter of 
      considerable satisfaction. In the field of disarmament the highlight 
      of India's efforts during the year was the Action Plan presented 
      by the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi. <br><br>The Indian delegation 
      played a useful role in negotiations leading to the declarations 
      adopted at the Ministerial Meetings of the Group of 77 and of the 
      Non-aligned Countries held prior to the 43rd Session of the UN 
      General Assembly. The General Assembly decided to set up an ad hoc 
      committee of the whole to formulate an international development 
      strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. <br><br>An 
      appreciation of India's positive role in the UN was reflected in her 
      election to important UN bodies such as the Inter-Governmental 
      Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and 
      Reporting; the Commission on Human Rights and the International 
      Institute for Unifica- tion of Private Law. India was also elected to 
      the prestigious post of Secreta ry- General of the International 
      Civil Aviation Organization and President of the international 
      Institute of Cotton. <br><br>Besides the programmes of bilateral 
      cooperation with neighbouring coun- tries India continued to 
      foster South-South cooperation by offering technical <br><br>(xix) 
      and economic assistance under the Indian Technical and Economic 
      Cooperation (ITEC) programme which is administered by the Ministry of 
      External Affairs. The expansion of the ITEC programme continued apace. 
      ITEC activities take the form of project assistance, deputation of 
      experts, training, and the provis ion of relief supplies such as 
      medicines and pesticides etc. to famine affected cou ntries of 
      Africa. <br><br>Afghanistan, Mauritius, Vietnam, Kampuchea, Laos, 
      Ethiopia, Kenya and the Seychelles were the main recipients of project 
      assistance. Requests were received for 127 experts in addition to 
      about 90 long-term Indian experts in position in different countries. 
      Till the end of December 1988, 358 persons ha d come to India for 
      training. <br><br>A comprehensive programme was drawn up in connection 
      with the birth centenary celebrations of India's first Prime Minister, 
      Shri Jawaharlal Nehru. Many functions were organised at several 
      world capitals through Indian Missions with the help of material 
      on photographic exhibitions and documentaries supplie d from 
      India. Indian Missions abroad also marked the conclusion of the cele- 
      brations of the Fortieth Anniversary of India's independence which 
      reinforced the image of a dynamic India with a rich cultural 
      heritage. <br><br>The improved climate of international relations and the 
      emerging detente has vindicated the stands taken by India and by 
      the Non-Aligned Movement over a wide-range of global and regional 
      issues. The continued relevance of th e Movement to promote the 
      process of detente and disarmament, the resolution of regional 
      conflicts and the re-ordering of the global economy places a specia l 
      responsibility on its members to seize the opportunities and meet the 
      challenge s of transforming the world order. <br><br>(xx)<br>

      CHAPTER I 
      <br><br>INDIA'S NEIGHBOURS <br><br>DURING the year under report, India 
      continued to pursue the goals of peace, friendship and cooperation in 
      relations with its neighbours in South Asia, bilaterally and through 
      fora like the SAARC, the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations. 
      The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement continued to be the framework for the 
      improvement and strengthening of bilateral relations between India and 
      Sri Lank a. Despite the continued, and often violent opposition of 
      extremist elements on both sides of the ethnic divide in Sri Lanka, 
      several steps were taken for the further implementation of the 
      Agreement. The most important of these was the successful holding 
      of elections to the North-eastern Province on Nov 19, 1988 which 
      completed the process of creation of Provincial Councils in all the 
      provinces of Sri Lanka. With these elections, the merger between the 
      Northern and Eastern Provinces became a reality and the 
      institutional framework for greater autonomy for the Tamils of Sri 
      Lanka was in place. The Government of Sri Lanka also passed the 
      16th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution giving Tamil equal 
      status as an official language along with Sinhala. Earlier, legisl 
      ative action had been taken to end the vexing problem of 
      citizenship for Tamils of Indian origin in the Central Highlands. With 
      the establishment of near normal conditions the displaced persons 
      continued to return to their homes. More than 34,000 Tamil 
      refugees have returned to Sri Lanka from India since the signing 
      of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement. <br><br>With these developments, 
      the desire of all sections of Sri Lankan society for a return to 
      peace and normalcy became more and more apparent. Despite LTTE's 
      threats of violence against anyone participating in the Provincial Counc 
      il elections, and their calls for a boycott of these polls, an 
      overwhelming number of Tamil voters turned out to vote for peace 
      and harmony. The commitment of the people of Sri Lanka to 
      democratic norms was again demonstrated in 
      <br>PG1<br>PG2<br>the Presidential elections in December 1988. 
      These developments enabled the Government to start withdrawing some 
      elements of the Indian Peace Keeping Force. If this encouraging trend 
      is maintained in the coming year, it should b e possible to 
      continue the process of a phased withdrawal of the IPKF. <br><br>The year 
      was marked by a continuation of close consultations and exchange 
      of visits between the two countries. Prime Minister Premadasa made 
      a month- long pilgrimage to India in March 1988. India's Minister of 
      Defence visited Colombo at the end of May as part of this continuing 
      exchange of visits. <br><br>India has the most cordial and friendly 
      relations with the Republic of Maldives. When foreign mercenaries 
      invaded Male in the early hours of 3 November 1988, India had no 
      hesitation in responding to a request from the democratically elected 
      Government of the Maldives for immediate military assistance to 
      protect their independence, non-alignment and sovereignty. India n 
      troops landed in Male in less than fourteen hours of receiving the 
      appeal from its Government and speedily brought the situation 
      under control. The Indian Navy conducted a successful commando 
      operation on the high seas and rescued Maldivian hostages who had been 
      seized by the fleeing mercenaries. <br><br>Almost every country in the 
      world supported India's action to assist Maldives in its hour of need. 
      Indian troops started withdrawing the very next day leaving a 
      small contingent of 275 troops at the express request of the President 
      of Maldives. President Gayoom paid a two-day visit to India on 7 
      and 8 December 1988. <br><br>In his meetings with the Indian Prime 
      Minister, ways and means of further expanding and consolidating 
      bilateral relations were discussed. Efforts to maintain and 
      further improve friendly relations with Bangladesh continued. 
      Events in that country were dominated by the disastrous floods in 
      September 1988. While unprecedented rains and a freak coincidence 
      of peak floods in several major rivers caused heavy damage all across 
      the sub-continent , the devastation caused by the floods 
      overshadowed everything else in that country. In keeping with its 
      responsibilities as a friendly neighbour, India w as 
      <br>PG3<br>the first country to respond to an appeal by the 
      Bangladesh Government for relief. Four Indian Air Force helicopters 
      were placed at the disposal of the Bangladesh Government within 
      hours of the appeal and more than 90 tonnes of food, clothing and 
      medicines were air lifted for relief work. <br><br>Unfortunately, there 
      were attempts by some sections to politicize this tragedy by blaming 
      India for what the Bangladesh Foreign Minister himself aptly described 
      as "an aberration of nature". India has been urging Bangladesh to 
      cooperate with it to harness the Brahmaputra river so that its flood 
      potenti al can be controlled and its abundant waters harnessed for 
      the benefit of both countries. India's comprehensive proposal first 
      made in 1978, was renewed to President Ershad when he visited 
      India on 29 September 1988. A Joint Task Force of water resources 
      experts of the two countries was set up to discuss pos sible 
      cooperation between the two countries for flood management. 
      Almost 45,000 Bangladeshi Chakma refugees continue to remain in 
      India almost three years after they first arrived. India continued to 
      urge Bangladesh to create the necessary conditions so that the 
      refugees gain the confidence to return voluntarily to their homes. 
      Burma is a close neighbour with whom India shares a long and 
      sensitive border. Relations between the two countries have 
      traditionally been cordial and without any major problems. India was, 
      therefore, concerned at the serious unrest which erupted in that 
      country during 1988. While this was essentially an internal 
      affair of that country, statements by Indian leaders made clear India's sympathy for the democratic aspirations of the people of Burma 
      and anguish at the suffering inflicted on the common people and the 
      large number of deaths of innocent people. In keeping with India's 
      tradition of not turning away peop le who come to Indian borders 
      to seek shelter, Burmese citizens crossing into India as a result 
      of the unrest were allowed to stay in camps in Mizoram and Arunachal 
      Pradesh. It is the earnest hope of the Government of India that the 
      problem in Burma will be resolved soon in accordance with the 
      wishes of the people of that country. <br><br>The tradition of 
      exchanges of high-level bilateral visits between India and Nepal 
      continued during the year under review. The Prime Minister and the 
      <br>PG4<br>King of Nepal had an opportunity for bilateral 
      discussions during the King's visit to Delhi in September 1988 
      primarily in his capacity as Chairman of the SAARC. The Minister 
      for External Affairs visited Kathmandu in August 1988 for a meeting of 
      the SAARC Ministerial Council. Bilateral discussions followed the 
      SAARC meeting; the first meeting of the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission was 
      also held. The Nepalese Foreign Minister made a transit halt in Delhi 
      en route to Islamabad for the SAARC Summit in December 1988 and 
      held bilateral discussions with the Minister for External Affairs. The 
      Speaker of the Lok Sabha visited Nepal in September 1988. 
      <br><br>Indo-Nepal economic cooperation continued to be close. 
      Negotiations for the renewal of the Treaty of Trade between the two 
      countries were concluded successfully with the initialling in 
      October 1988 of the text of the new Treaty of Trade. India 
      continued to implement a number of economic development projects in 
      Nepal under its Aid Nepal Programme. Cooperation in the field of 
      water resources was comprehensively reviewed at the first meeting 
      of the Sub- Commission on Water Resources of Indo-Nepal Joint 
      Commission. The meeting took important decisions on the Karnali and 
      Pancheshwar multi-purpose projects and a number of other projects 
      on smaller rivers common to India and Nepal. Transfer of technology in 
      water resources between India and Nepal was also discussed. 
      The traditionally close and friendly relations between India and 
      Bhutan were further strengthened. There were important exchange of 
      visits. From India , the Foreign Secretary, Shri K.P.S. Menon; the 
      Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi and the President, Shri R. 
      Venkataraman visited Bhutan from 5 to 8 April 1988, 23 to 27 
      September 1988 and 18 to 21 October 1988 respectively. From Bhutan, 
      the Deputy Minister of Planning, Dasho Chenkyab Dorji visited 
      India from 15 to 18 June and on 16 September 1988 and the Bhutanese 
      Foreign Minister, Lyonpo Dawa Tsering, on 28 August 1988. During these 
      visits fruitful discussions on subjects of mutual interest were 
      held. The discussions were marked by a close identity of views 
      and understanding on matters of mutual interest reflecting the 
      relationship of trust and cooperation that prevails between the two 
      countries. <br><p></p></td></tr>

      <br>Cooperation 
      flourished in the economic field. On 21 October the prestigious 
      336 MW Chukha Hydel Project built entirely with Indian assistance was 
      jointly inaugurated by the President, Shri R. Venkataraman and His 
      Majesty the King of Bhutan. As per the 1974 Chukha Agreement, India is 
      continuing to purchase <br>PG5<br>power from Chukha which is 
      surplus to Bhutan's internal requirement. The Royal Government of 
      Bhutan has earned Rs. 30.11 crores from February to October 1988 by 
      the sale of surplus power to India. A long-term agreement on purchase 
      of power is under finalisation. <br><br>Discussions are continuing (i) for 
      the implementation of Dungsum (Nanglam) Cement Project in Eastern 
      Bhutan estimated to cost over Rs. 140 crores with the surplus cement 
      production to be purchased by India; <br>(ii) Kurichu 45 MW 
      Hydro-Electric Project at the estimated cost of over Rs. 100 crores; 
      <br>(iii) Gaylegphug Area Development Project at the estimated cost of 
      over Rs. 5 crores. The annual bilateral meeting to discuss the 
      Bhutanese Sixth Plan (1987-92 ) was held in New Delhi in June 1988 
      at, which progress in the on-going projects and projects for other 
      mutually beneficial projects were discussed. The Khaling Mi ni 
      Hydel Project (0. 6 MW; Rs. 1.9 crores) inaugurated on 8 March 1988 in 
      expected to be handed over to the Royal Government early in 1989 
      and the Gyetsa Mini Hydel Project (1.5 MW; Rs. 3.84 crores) 
      commissioned in July 1988 is also expected to be handed over to Bhutan 
      early in 1989. <br><br>Other on-going projects are : Chukha Transmission 
      Line Project (Rs. 18 crores); the River Training Works at Dhoti 
      Khola and Paro (Rs. 1.28 crores); the Taktichu Super Group Drop 
      Project (Rs. 3.7 crores); the Paro Airfield Extension Project (over 
      Rs. 6 crores) and the Broadcasting Station Project (Rs. 5.9 crores). 
      The Bongaingaon-Gaylegphug Transmission Line Project (Rs. 8.55 crores) 
      is expected to be completed by December 1989 and the Thimphu- Paro 
      Sub-transmission and distribution systems project (Rs. 11.5 crores) by 
      1990. <br><br>India continues to provide experts and specialists to 
      Bhutan in the fields of forestry, industry, telecommunications, 
      hydel-survey and education etc. In education, India continues to 
      offer opportunities for secondary as wel l as higher education, 
      for training in various fields such as civil aviation, pol ice, 
      defence, customs, medicine and engineering. As in the past, about 40 
      Bhutanese students a year are availing of Government of India 
      scholarships. In addition a large number of scholarships are 
      provided to the Bhutanese under the Colombo Plan for studies in India. 
      <br>PG6<br>In order to strengthen bilateral cultural relations, the 
      two Governments have agreed to hold a Bhutan week in Delhi which 
      is scheduled to be held from 10 to 16 March 1989. As in the past, 
      delegations from the Bhutan-India Friend- ship Association (BIFA), 
      Schools etc. visited India during 1988. With effect from 28 
      November 1988 the Bhutanese Druk Air has also started its direct twice 
      a week Paro-Delhi-Paro flights with the newly acquired BAe 146-100 
      aircraft. It is expected that this would contribute to greater 
      interaction bet ween the nationals of the two countries and 
      increase in bilateral trade. <br><br>India continued to supply at the 
      request of the Royal Government of Bhutan, certain essential 
      commodities such as wheat, rice, sugar, coal, explosi ves, steel 
      and edible oil at controlled prices. India has consistently sought 
      to develop friendly and good neighbourly relations with Pakistan in 
      accordance with the Simla Agreement. India welcomed the emergence 
      of a democratic government in Pakistan, which hopefully would 
      facilitate the normalisation of relations between the two countries. 
      In 1988, both President Venkataraman and Prime Minister Rajiv 
      Gandhi had occasion to visit Pakistan. The President, Shri 
      Venkataraman, led a high- level delegation to Pakistan for the 
      funeral of the late President Zia-ul-Haq o n 20 August 1988. The 
      Prime Minister visited Islamabad from 29 to 31 December 1988 in 
      connection with the 4th SAARC Summit. During the visit be had intensiv 
      e discussions with Prime Minister Ms Benazir Bhutto on bilateral 
      and other issues of mutual interest. These talks culminated in the 
      signing of three agre ements with Pakistan, namely; <br>(i) 
      Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and 
      Facilities, <br>(ii) Cultural Cooperation Agreement and (iii) Avoidance of 
      Double Taxation of Income Derived from International Air Transport. 
      The Indian Commerce Minister Shri Dinesh Singh also visited 
      Islamabad from 1 to 5 October 1988 to attend an informal Ministerial 
      Meeting oil GATT- related issues. During the visit he held talks with 
      his Pakistani counterpart Dr Mehboob-ul-Haq on Indo-Pak trade. 
      <br>PG7<br>In order to maintain a continuous dialogue with Pakistan 
      with the aim of improving relations, a number of important bilateral 
      meetings at the official level were held during the year. Home 
      Secretary and Foreign Secretary level talks were held in New 
      Delhi from 14 to 16 May and from 1 to 2 June 1988 respectively . 
      During these talks India's over-riding concern at Pakistan's abetment 
      of terrorist activity directed against India was again conveyed 
      to them. Two rounds of Defence Secretary level talks were held in May 
      and September 1988 to arriveata solution to the Siachen issue. 
      Other important bilateral meetings were Secretary-level talks to 
      resolve the issue of the Tulbul Navigation Project; the secondr ound 
      of talks to discuss problems arising from the detention of fishermen 
      and fishing vessels by India and Pakistan and a meeting of the 
      India-Pakistan Committee to combat drug trafficking and smuggling. 
      India is keen to work for an accelerated normalisation of 
      relations with Pakistan. It is hoped that the impetus given to the 
      relations by the meeting between the two Prime Ministers in 
      December 1988 can be sustained. This will, however, depend in 
      large measure on how Pakistan responds to India's major concerns 
      particularly its support to terrorist activities directed against Indi 
      a, its clandestine weapon-oriented nuclear programme, its 
      acquisition of sophistic a- ted weapons far beyond its genuine 
      defence requirements, its reluctance to increase people-to-people 
      contacts and its unwillingness to enter into non- discriminatory trade 
      relations with India. However, India has taken note of Prime Minister 
      Benazir Bhutto's statements that she wants to resolve all out- 
      standing bilateral problems within the framework provided by the 
      Simla Agreement and that Pakistan would not like to interfere in 
      India's internal affairs. <br><br>In view of its vital stakes in 
      Afghanistan, India continued to take an act ive interest in the 
      rapidly changing situation there. The signing of the UN-sponsored 
      Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan in April 1988 was an important step 
      towards a peaceful political settlement of the Afghan problem. 
      India welcomed these accords maintaining that their sincere 
      implementation by all parties concerned could lead to restoration of 
      peace and stability in the region. India stands for a sovereign, 
      non-aligned, independen t Afghanistan and further feels that the 
      Afghans themselves should be allowed to decide upon their future 
      without external pressures. <br>PG8<br>President Najibullah paid an 
      official visit to India from 4 to 6 May 1988 for an exchange of 
      views. The visit took place in the context of India's conti nuing 
      dialogue on the Afghanistan problem with all concerned including all 
      shades of Afghan opinion. Earlier, on 3 May the Foreign Secretary, 
      Shri K.P.S. Menon visited Islamabad as the Prime Minister's special 
      emissary for discussion on th e Afghan situation with President 
      Zia and other Pakistani leaders. <br><br>Bilateral relations between India 
      and Afghanistan developed satisfactorily . India remained in close 
      touch with the Government of Afghanistan on all matters of mutual 
      interest and undertook to provide an assistance of Rs. 10 crores for 
      relief and rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees. Half of this 
      assistance is t o be provided bilaterally and the other half 
      through the UN system. In addition Ind ia is continuing with its 
      cooperation programme in Afghanistan, which is directed at 
      benefiting the common man in areas such as public health, small scale 
      indust ry, education etc. <br><br>A mid-term review meeting of the 
      Indo-Afghan Joint Commission on Economic, Technical, Trade and 
      Cultural Cooperation was held in Kabul in June 1988. The 
      Indo-Afghan Cultural Exchange Programme was extended upto 31 December 
      1989. SAARC continued to make progress during the year. The 
      Ministry of External Affairs functioned as the national focal point 
      and worked closely with all the other Ministries, Departments and 
      agencies involved with specific aspec ts of India's participation 
      in SAARC activities. <br><br>The Fourth SAARC Summit in Islamabad in 
      December 1988 provided the opportunity for a complete review of the 
      organization's activities during 1988. The Summit took the 
      following major decisions : -- Education was included as an area 
      of cooperation and a Technical Committee set up, to be chaired by 
      Bangladesh. Specific programmes are now to be devised. -- As a 
      measure to foster closer and more frequent contacts among the people 
      of the member countries, Supreme Court judges and Members of 
      Parliament of each member country would be entitled to a special 
      <br>PG9<br>SAARC Travel Document which would exempt them from visas 
      while travelling in the region. The Council of Ministers is to make 
      recommen- dations regarding other categories of persons who should be 
      given this facility. -- A regional perspective plan called 
      "SAARC 2000 : A Basic Needs Perspective" is to be prepared, based on 
      the aggregation of development targets set by individual member 
      countries for the turn of the century in core areas of interest such 
      as food, clothing, shelter, education, primary health care, population 
      planning and environmental protection. <br><br>-- A proposal for the 
      establishment of a Centre for Human Resource Development is to be 
      examined. -- South Asian Festivals are to be held from time to 
      time. India is to ho st the first such Festival. In areas 
      where activity has been on-going, the Summit decided as follows -- 
      The comprehensive Study on the Causes and Consequences of Natural 
      Disasters and the Protection and Preservation of the Environment 
      should be concluded in the shortest period of time. A joint study 
      would be undertaken on the "Greenhouse effect" and its impact on the 
      region. -- Specific areas where economic cooperation in trade, 
      manufactures and <p></p></td></tr>

      services may be 
      feasible immediately are to be identified. -- 1989 was designated 
      as the "SAARC Year for Combating Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking". A 
      concerted campaign is to be launched. The possibility of drawing 
      up a Regional Convention on Drug Control is to be examined. <br><br>-- 
      Member States should adopt enabling measures to implement the SAARC 
      Regional Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism at the earliest. 
      -- The Year 1990 is to be the "SAARC Year of the, Girl Child". 
      <br>PG10<br>The Summit also endorsed the decisions of the Council of 
      Ministers taken at the latter's fifth session in Kathmandu in 
      August 1988, on : -- The admission of any country in the region, 
      subscribing to the objective s and principles of the SAARC 
      Charter, as a member of the Association, by a unanimous decision of 
      the Heads of State or Government. -- The establishment of contact 
      with organizations with similar aims and purposes, subject to the 
      approval of the Standing Committee in each case, with a view to 
      sharing of experiences and exchange of documents and information, and 
      -- The increased involvement of non-governmental organizations, 
      consisting of nationals of member countries based in the region, 
      in SAARC activi- ties in agreed areas of cooperation. There 
      were several other noteworthy developments during the year <br>(i) The 
      Agreement establishing the SAARC Food Security Reserve became 
      operational from 12 August 1988. All member countries have earmarked 
      their respective shares for the Reserve. <br>(ii) The SAARC Regional 
      Convention on Suppression of Terrorism came into force on 22 August 
      1988 after ratification by all member States. Member countries are to 
      pass national legislation wherever necessary to implement the 
      Convention. <br>(iii) The terms of reference and methodology for the 
      comprehensive study on the Causes and Consequences of Natural 
      Disasters and Protection and Preservation of Environment have been 
      agreed upon. The objective of the regional study is to provide a basis 
      for the member countries to draw up policy conclusions and 
      recommendations and to identify areas, keeping in view the potential 
      and possibilities of evolving a regional plan of action, for 
      strengthening disaster management capa- bilities and for the 
      protection and preservation of the environment. Country-wise studies 
      are to be conducted in the first instance, accor- ding to a 
      standardised format which is to be finalised. <br>(iv) Studies are to 
      be undertaken to identify specific constraints to the growth of 
      intra-regional trade and economic cooperation. The terms of reference, 
      methodology and format have been agreed upon. Work is being done on a 
      country-wise basis to start with. <br>PG11<br>(v) The Third Meeting 
      of Planners held in Kathmandu in November 1988 made several 
      far-reaching recommendations regarding the role of economic 
      cooperation in developing a long-term perspective for SAARC 
      activities. The meeting underlined that economic cooperation would 
      provide the means by which regional cooperation could contri- bute to 
      fulfilling the basic needs of people in the Member countries. The 
      meeting also made suggestions regarding regional cooperation in the 
      field of education and human resource development. <br>(vi) The SAARC 
      Agricultural Information Centre at Dhaka started taking shape with the 
      first meeting of its Governing Board in December 1988.

      <br>(vii) The SAARC 
      Audio-Visual Exchange (SAVE) completed its first year in November 
      1988. The first special programme, the SAARC Quiz, was produced by 
      India for telecast by member countries in February 1989. The Islamabad 
      Summit lauded the smooth functioning of SAVE and directed that 
      emphasis be given to social, economic and technical issues. 
      <br>(viii) The SAARC Youth Volunteers Programme and the Scheme for 
      SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships were launched. Both are 
      expected to be fully operational in 1989. Under the Integrated 
      Programme of Action in the 11 areas of cooperation, some 50 
      activities were organised between the end of the Kathmandu Summit, in 
      November 1987, and December 1988. India participated in nearly all the 
      activities and organised 16. In addition, India hosted two Technical 
      Committee meetings, on Agriculture and Women in Development to 
      plan activities in these sectors, two meetings of the SAARC 
      Audio-Visual Exchange Committee to plan and choose programmes for 
      region-wide broadcast and telecast and two meetings to work out 
      details for the SAARC Documentation Centre and for the Scheme on SAARC 
      Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships respectively. <br><br>India has

      THE mutual desire 
      to widen and diversify bilateral cooperation between India and the 
      countries in South-East Asia was evidenced by the exchange of several 
      official delegations leading to increased interaction in economic, comm 
      er- cial and other fields. <br><br>Indonesia's Foreign Minister, 
      Mr Ali Alatas visited India in August 1988 and held discussions on 
      the Kampuchean question. Shri N.D. Tiwari, the then Minister for 
      Finance and Commerce was in Indonesia in April 1988 to participate 
      in an ADB Meeting. In August 1988 a senior officials delegation 
      from Indonesia came to discuss the widening and diversifying of 
      the scope of the Trade Agreeme nt signed in 1978. <br><br>Prime 
      Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore paid an official visit to India 
      in March 1988. Other important visits included the seventy member 
      business delegation led by Mr Mah Bow Tan, Singapore's Minister of 
      State for Trade and Industry in November 1988. From the Indian side, 
      Shri Ram Niwas Mirdha, Minister for Textiles paid a brief visit to 
      Singapore in December 1988 to discu ss further commercial 
      interaction between the two countries. His visit was preced ed by 
      a delegation from the Confederation of Engineering Industries in November 
      1988. A four-member Thai delegation led by the Secretary, 
      Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thailand, visited India from 19 to 22 
      April 1988 for annual bilateral consultations. Commercial 
      relations with Thailand, and indeed the whole ASEAN region expanded 
      considerably. Rice purchases from Thailand were useful in building up 
      India's buffer stocks depleted during the prolonged droug ht 
      situation in previous years. <br>PG12<br>PG13<br>General 
      Manuel Yan, Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Government of the 
      Philippines paid an official visit to India in December 1988. During th 
      e discussions, it was agreed to explore cooperation in atomic 
      energy, agricultura l, technical and economic fields. 
      Sultan Yang Di Pertuan of Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah 
      Muizzaddin Waddaulah would be paying a State visit to India in March 
      1989. <br><br>India's relations with the three Indo-China states remain 
      extremely cordia l. Relations with Vietnam were marked by 
      exchanges of visits at high levels. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv 
      Gandhi paid a one day official visit to Vietnam on 16 April 1988. 
      He was received by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of 
      Vietnam. On the Prime Minister's invitation the General Secretary, Mr 
      Van Linh was the Chief Guest at the celebration of India's Republic Day in 
      January 1989. <br><br>The third Indo-Vietnamese Joint Commission 
      Meeting was held from 20 to 23 January 1989. During the meeting, 
      credits, commodity loans and grant assistance were reviewed. The 
      Work Programmes under the Science and Technology Agreement and in the 
      field of Atomic Energy were also taken up. Delegations from All India 
      Radio and Doordarshan visited Vietnam and identified areas of 
      cooperation. The Rice Research Centre is functioning well. <br><br>The 
      Indian Ambassador to Vietnam, Shri Arun Patwardhan, his wife and son 
      were killed along with seven officials from the Department of Education 
      and the regional representative of Central India Machinery 
      Manufacture Company (CIMMCO) when the Air Vietnam flight in which they 
      were travelling crashed near Bangkok on 9 September 1988. The 
      Vietnamese leadership conveyed their sincere condolences at this 
      tragic accident. <br><br>A delegation led by Shri Ram Niwas Mirdha, 
      Minister for Textiles repre- sented India at the celebrations of 
      the Tenth Anniversary of the People's Repub lic of Kampuchea in 
      January 1989. The restoration of the Angkor Vat in Kampuchea by 
      the Archaeological Survey of India is continuing to the satisfaction 
      of the Kampuchean Government. <br>PG14<br>The Kampuchean Prime 
      Minister, Mr Hun Sen was in India for a brief working visit from 16 to 
      17 November 1988. Apart from discussing bilateral relations, the 
      purpose of the visit was to consult with Indian leaders on the 
      Kampuchean question. India's friendly relations and 
      economic cooperation were maintained through the Indian Technical 
      Cooperation Programme. India provides training in diverse fields such 
      as Science and Technology, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry , 
      classical dance and music, etc. to nominees from Vietnam, Laos and 
      Kampuchea. <br><br>Indian experts are also deputed to these countries for 
      training purposes as wel l as to work on projects. In 
      December 1988, Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister of State for External 
      Affairs toured Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and 
      Singapore as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy on Kampuchea to 
      discuss progress in the resolution of the Kampuchean problem. The 
      Minister also briefed the Govern- ments on the important visit of 
      President Gorbachev to India and held consulta- tions on the 
      historic visit of the Prime Minister to China. India's contributi on 
      to the process of resolution of the Kampuchean problem was deeply 
      appreciated and an interest was evinced in working with India towards 
      this end. <br><br>Apart from meeting with the various parties including 
      Prince Sihanouk, Kampuchean Prime Minister Hun Sen and leaders in the 
      Indo-Chinese and ASEAN countries, India participated in the Senior 
      Officials' Meetings of the Non-alig ned countries the first of 
      which was held in New Delhi from 15 to 16 July. This wa s followed 
      by a second meeting at Harare from 15 to 17 August 1988. The NAM 
      Foreign Ministers' Conference at Nicosia considered the Report of the 
      Senior Officials' Meeting and set up a NAM Committee on Kampuchea 
      which now has fourteen members. The Non-Aligned Movement welcomed the 
      Jakarta Informal Meetings chaired by Indonesia and regarded its own 
      efforts as supportive and complementary to the regional initiative. 
      There was a marked increase in exchanges with Australia in the 
      fields of trade, science and technology, mining, coal, 
      agriculture, energy and railways. <br><br>India's participation in the 
      bicentennial celebrations of Australia, the signin g of a new 
      Cultural Exchange Programme for the year 1989 to 1991, the eleventh 
      meeting of the India-Australia Joint Trade Committee in Canberra in 
      May and <br>PG15<br>the discussions held during the visit of Mr John 
      Kerin, the Australian Minister for Primary Industries and Energy 
      with his counterparts in India culminated in the visit of the 
      Australian Prime Minister Mr R.J.L. Hawke in February 1989. The, 
      Third meeting of the Joint Business Council took place during that visit. 
      The visit of Mr Hawke and his talks with Prime Minister Rajiv 
      Gandhi has given a new impetus to the relationship in accordance 
      with the desire expressed by both leaders during Shri Rajiv Gandhi's 
      visit to Australia in October 1986. Memoranda of Understanding in the 
      fields of Railways, Telecommunications and Meteorology were signed as 
      well as one on Concessional Financing of Development Projects. 
      Delegations of the Members of Parliament visited Australia in the 
      month of September 1988 to attend the World Women Parliamentarians' 
      Peace Confe- rence and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association 
      Conference. The Minister of State for Science and Technology, Shri K. 
      R. Narayanan visited Australia from 17 to 29 October 1988. The Chief 
      of Army Staff, General V.N. Sharma, paid a goodwill visit to Australia 
      from 20 to 26 November 1988. <br><br>India and New Zealand have also been 
      maintaining friendly relations. The situation in Fiji deteriorated 
      further as the effect of the two milit ary coups of 1987 seeped 
      into the fabric of daily life. The Internal Security Decre e and 
      the Sunday Observances Decree were the instruments that constrained the 
      activities of Fijians of Indian origin and strained relations between 
      the diffe rent races. The draft of a new Constitution was approved 
      by the Interim Government despite protests by the deposed Prime 
      Minister, Dr Bavadra and the Indian ethnic members of the Fijian 
      Parliament. The Government of India issued a statement regretting that 
      the draft had not given just and equitable representa - tion to 
      the different communities and contained several provisions that were 
      undemocratic and discriminatory and detrimental to the interests of 
      peace, stability and racial harmony in Fiji. The Interim Government 
      set<p></p></td></tr>

      up a Constitu 
      - tion Enquiry and Advisory Committee which was supposed to 
      receive submissions from all sections and communities and generate 
      debate on the proposed Consti- tution. In actual fact, Dr 
      Bavadra's Coalition members were prevented from organising public 
      meetings to debate the provisions of the draft Constitution. 
      Nevertheless, leaders of the Indian community have rejected the 
      draft as blatan tly <br>PG16<br>discriminatory, seeking to 
      deprive them of their guaranteed Constitutional righ ts. While 
      institutionalising ethnic Fijian political dominance, it also discriminat 
      es against Commoner Fijians. Through letters to the editors of 
      newspapers and submissions to the Constitution Enquiry Committee, in 
      their private capacities, the Coalition leaders, both Indian and 
      Fijian, have highlighted the racist, feu dal and authoritarian 
      character of the proposed Constitution. The Government of India has 
      issued several statements on the provisions of the draft Constitution 
      , sporting contacts between Fiji and South Africa etc. and calling 
      for the restor a- tion of the democratically elected Government, 
      the revocation of the Internal Security Decree and the return to 
      racial harmony in Fiji. India continued its trade ban with Fiji.

      CHAPTER III 
      <br><br>EAST ASIA THE year under review saw the first visit by a 
      Prime Minister of India to C hina in thirty-four years. The Prime 
      Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China, from 19 to Dec 23, 
      1988 was recognised as an event of major importance and historic 
      significance. The visit marked a new beginning in India-China 
      relations. The enhancement of mutual understanding between India and 
      China, and their joint reaffirmation of the Five Principles of 
      Peaceful Co-existence, not only conforms to the fundamental 
      interests of the peoples of both countries, but actively contributes 
      to peace and stability in Asia and the world where als o there is 
      some movement towards the replacement of confrontation by dialogue. 
      The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi held discussions on 
      bilateral, regional and international issues with the Chinese Premier, 
      Li Peng, Chairman o f the Central Military Commission, Deng 
      Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhao 
      Ziyang, and the Chinese President Yang Shangkun. During the visit, the 
      two Governments signed an Agreement on Cooperation in Science and 
      Technology, an Agreement relating to Civil Air Transport, and an 
      executive programme for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 under the 
      Agreement for Cultural Cooperation. <br><br>Earnest and in-depth 
      discussions were held on the boundary question. It was agreed that 
      this question should be settled through peaceful and friendl y 
      consultations between India and China. There was recognition that a 
      favourable climate and conditions for a fair and reasonable, and 
      mutually acceptable solut ion of the question, should be created 
      through sincere and unremitting efforts by both countries. It was 
      decided to establish a joint working group on the question. The Group 
      will address the question of an overall boundary settlemen t, as 
      well as ensure the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the border 
      areas . it was also agreed to develop relations actively in other 
      fields. A joint grou p on economic relations, trade, and science 
      and technology, would be set up at the Ministerial level. 
      <br>PG17<br><pg18><br>The Minister for External Affairs, 
      Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, who accompanied the Prime Minister during his 
      visit to China, held discussions on a wide-range of regional and 
      international issues with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. 
      These discussions were held in a cordial and frank atmosphere. The 
      Minister for Commerce, Shri Dinesh Singh, also held discussion s 
      with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, 
      Zheng Tuobin. <br><br>The Prime Minister extended an invitation to the 
      Chinese Premier, Li Peng, to visit India. The invitation was accepted.

      1988. An annual Trade Protocol for 1988-89 was also signed in June 
      1988, during the visit of the Commerce Secretary, Shri A.N. Varma, 
      to Beijing. During the year, delegations that visited India from 
      China included those in the fields of electronics, biotechnology, 
      forestry, buffalo breeding and the film industry. A five-member 
      delegation from the State Planning Commission of China also 
      visited India in June 1988. Delegations that visited China from India 
      included a delegation from the Communist Party of India led by Shri 
      Rajeswara Rao, a Congress (I) delegation led by Shri B.R. Bhagat, MP,

      West Bengal, and all All India Forward Bloc delegation led by Shri 
      Chitta Basu, MP. <br><br>India's relations with Japan in the economic, 
      commercial, cultural and scientific fields registered further 
      progress. India-Japanese relations had re ceived a new impetus 
      with the visit of the Japanese Prime Minister to India in 1984 an d 
      the visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Japan in 1985. The 
      Festival of India was held in Japan from April to October 1988. This 
      was held in more than thirty cities in Japan. The highlights were 
      the rendition of Indian music and display of paintings, sculpture 
      and tribal art. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, visited 
      Tokyo on 15 April to inaugurate the Festiv al along with the

      especially, the upgradation of some railway workshops and 
      intra-city traffic movement. <br><br>Japan's Official Development 
      Assistance (ODA) to India was Yen 87.9 billion. This was a 25 per cent 
      increase over the previous year's and made Jap an the largest 
      bilateral donor to India in gross terms. In India-Japan trade, the 
      deficit declined to a lower level than in the previous year. The 
      noticeable features in trade were a considerable increase i n 
      Indian exports of diamonds to Japan and the high Yen-induced decline 
      in imports of Japanese machinery and equipment. The 
      Twenty-first Joint Meeting of the India-Japan Business Cooperation 
      Committee was held in New Delhi from 5 to 7 December. Measures to 
      promote trade, investment, joint ventures and other collaborations 
      were discussed. The Second meeting of the Joint Committee on 
      Science and Technology took place in Tokyo in July. <br><br>With the 
      Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

      CHAPTER IV 
      <br><br>WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA DURING <br>the year under review, 
      India's relations with the countries of the West Asia and North 
      Africa region saw a further intensification and consolidation in all 
      the important areas including political, economic and cult ural. 
      An important development in the region was the renewed 
      international focus on the Palestinian question as a result of the 
      Palestinian uprising in th e West Bank and the Gaza Strip against 
      continued Israeli occupation. The "intifida" was largely responsible 
      for the decision to establish the State of Palestine. In October 
      1988 Chairman Yasser Arafat visited India to brief the Indian 
      leaders on the then Prevailing situation in the occupied territories and 
      the various options that were under consideration by the PLO. He 
      was assured of India's full support. The historic proclamation of an 
      independent Palestine State was made on Nov 15, 1988 at the end of the 
      extraordinary Palestinian National Council Sessions in Algiers during 
      which a wide-ranging political statement aimed at creating a positive 
      climate for resumption of the Middle- East peace process was also 
      adopted. India was among the first countries to recognise the newly 
      declared Palestinian State. <br><br>India continued with its firm and 
      unequivocal support for the Palestinian cause bilaterally and in 
      the relevant international fora. Israeli atrocities a gainst 
      unarmed Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories were 
      strongly condemn ed. India had expressed regret at the US refusal 
      of a visa to Chairman Arafat to address the UN General Assembly 
      Session in New York. India welcomed the emergence of positive 
      political trends in the region and it is India's hope tha t these 
      will lead to the early convening of the International Peace Conference 
      under UN auspices with the participation of all the parties to the 
      Arab-Israeli dispute including the PLO as the sole legitimate 
      representative of the Palestin ian people. India feels that such a 
      conference provides the only viable forum for effective 
      Middle-East peace negotiations and has been actively supporting all 
      efforts to bring this about. <br>PG21<br>PG22<br>The 
      Speaker of the Palestinian National Council, Sheik Abdul Hameed 
      El-Sayeh visited India in March 1988. India had deplored the 
      assassination in Tunis in April 1988, of Khalil Al Wazir (Abu 
      Jihad), Deputy Commander-in- Chief of Palestine Revolutionary Forces. 
      The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi visited Syria in June 1988. 
      Wide- ranging discussions on bilateral, regional and international 
      issues of common interest with Syrian leaders gave a renewed 
      impetus to bilateral ties. From th e Syrian side, a Parliamentary 
      delegation visited India in August 1988 and an Indian Parliamentary 
      delegation visited Syria in January 1989. The Prime Minister's visit 
      to Jordan in July 1988 provided an opportunity for further 
      strengthening bilateral economic cooperation and continuing the close 
      political dialogue between the two countries. Earlier, the Crown 
      Prince of Jordan visite d India in April 1988. From the Indian 
      side, the visits of the Minister of State for Health, Kumari Saroj 
      Khaparde in September and of the Chief Justice of India, Shri R. 
      S. Pathak and a high-level Science and Technology delegation in October 
      1988 added to the growing content of Indo-Jordanian relations. An 
      Agreement on Civil Aviation was signed between India and Jordan in May 
      1988. A Manpower agreement was signed during the visit of Mr Marwan 
      Akram Issa Dudin, Jordanian Labour Minister in October 1988. The 
      release on 4 October 1988 of Dr Mithileshwar Singh who was kidnapped 
      in Beirut in January 1987 was another welcome development. The 
      Government of India had maintained constant pressure for his release. 
      Relations between India and Egypt witnessed further 
      intensification. The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri 
      K.K. Tewary visited Egypt in Octob er 1988 and had very useful 
      discussions with Egyptian leaders on various international, regional 
      and bilateral issues of mutual interest. The second Se ssion of 
      the Joint Commission also took place in October 1988. The Minister for 
      Commerce, Shri Dinesh Singh, visited Cairo for this meeting at which 
      intensifi- cation of bilateral economic interaction was discussed. 
      A Parliamentary delega - tion led by the Speaker, Shri Balram 
      Jakhar, visited Egypt in December 1988. T he Egyptian Minister of 
      State for Scientific Research, Dr Adel Abdel Hamid Ezz visited India 
      in April 1988. During the visit, a work plan for scientific and 
      techno- logical cooperation between the two countries for the 
      period 1988-91 was signed . <br><br>The Egyptian Minister of Education, Dr 
      Ahmed Sirour visited India in September 1988. Apart from 
      discussions on cooperation in the field or education, a Cultu ral 
      Exchange Programme was also signed during the visit. 
      <br>PG23<br>India's relations with Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti in 
      the Horn of Africa remain friendly. India sent relief assistance 
      amounting to Rupees five lakhs t o Sudan in the wake of severe 
      floods in the Blue Nile basin in August 1988. The Foreign Minister 
      of Djibouti visited India in January 1989. During his visit an 
      agreement on cultural, scientific and technical cooperation was si 
      gned. In February 1989, a Special Envoy of the President of 
      Somalia visited India with a message from the President. <br><br>In 
      the Maghreb region, India maintained its close consultations and 
      cooperation with Algeria. The meeting of the Indo-Algerian

      was held in March 1988. The Algerian Minister of Light Industries, Mr 
      Zitauni Messaoudi visited India in this connection. With Tunisia 
      also, bilateral conta cts were strengthened both in the political 
      and economic spheres. The Minister of State for External Affairs, 
      Shri K.K. Tewary, visited Tunisia in October 1988. <br><br>This was the 
      first high-level visit from India since the present Tunisian Gover 
      nment came into power. India's relations with Libya 
      remained good. Efforts to resolve the problem of outstanding 
      payments to Indian companies continued. Diplomatic relations were 
      restored between India and Morocco on 21 October 1988. The respective 
      Embassies started functioning from 21 November 1988. Shri Anand 
      Sharma, MP, participated in the celebrations of the Fifteenth 
      Anniversary of Polisario Front in May 1988. A Special Envoy of the 
      Saharawi Arab Democratic Repub- lic (SADR) President visited India in 
      June 1988. A consignment of relief items was sent to the Saharawi 
      Red Cross Society during 1988. The Head of the Arab League, Mr 
      Chadli Klibi visited India in May 1988 for discussions with the Indian 
      leaders. India continued with its efforts to bring an early end to 
      the Gulf confli ct through regular contacts with Iraq, Iran and 
      all other concerned countries. The escalation of foreign Naval 
      presences in the Gulf had caused concern. Indi a deplored the 
      shooting down of an Iranian civilian aircraft by the US Navy on 3 July 
      1988. The ceasefire in the war on 20 August 1988, was warmly welcomed 
      and it was hoped that negotiations under UN auspices to implement 
      UN Security <br>PG24<br>Council Resolution 598 would lead to the 
      establishment of a just and durable peace and the strengthening of the 
      forces of non-alignment in the region. Indi a has deputed 15 
      military officers to serve with the United Nations Iran and Iraq 
      Military Observers Group established to monitor the ceasefire. 
      Special envoys from Iraq and Iran visited India during the period 
      under review to brief the leadership on developments concerning the 
      war and the post-war negotiations. India has been invited to and hopes 
      to participate actively in the post-war reconstruction of Iran and 
      Iraq. Though the Indo-Iranian Joint Commission did not meet during 
      1988, efforts continued to be made to expand bilateral economic 
      interaction. Efforts were made to increase trade through the 
      purchase of Iranian crude oil and intensive negotiations were 
      undertaken to evolve a mutually acceptable settle- ment of the 
      long pending problem of the Kudremukh Iron Ore Project. The 
      Eleventh Session of the Indo-Iraqi Joint Commission held in October 
      1988, in Baghdad, identified areas for intensified bilateral economic 
      coopera- tion. Indian companies which continued to operate in Iraq

      participation in Iraq's ambitio us post-war reconstruction 
      programme.<br><br> Shri K. K. Tewary, Minister of State for External 
      Affairs, participated in the Second International Babylon Festival 
      and undertook a review of bilateral, regional and international 
      matters with the Iraqi leadership. <br><br>The ability of India to 
      maintain its share of the labour market despite a degree of 
      economic recession through the presence of about a million expatriate 
      s has furnished a valuable link between India and the Gulf region. 
      India has als o secured a larger share of the industrial market in 
      these countries and there is growing interest in joint investment 
      in the region and in India. <br><br>Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister of 
      State for External Affairs visited Oman from 8 to 12 April 1988. 
      During this visit intensive discussions were held wit h the 
      leadership in Oman on regional and international issues and the areas in 
      which bilateral cooperation could be intensified were identified. This

      CHAPTER V 
      <br><br>AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA) INDIA'S friendly relations 
      with the countries of Africa (South of the Sahara) were further 
      strengthened during the year under review. India continued to play a 
      leading role at the United Nations and other international fora in 
      supporting the struggle of the people of South Africa and the Frontline 
      States in Southern Africa against the abhorrent system of 
      apartheid in South Africa. <br><br>The second meeting of the 
      Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa of which 
      India is a member, was hold in Toronto in August 1988. The Indian

      Summit of the Heads of State/Government of the Movement of Non-aligned 
      countries in Harare in September 1986, has so far received pledges in 
      cash, kind and project assistanc e equivalent to US $ 413 million 
      from 52 countries the world over. The actual cash contributions 
      received by the Fund are approaching US $ 1 million. <br><br>After 
      launching the appeal, contributions were received from individuals 
      as well as organizations in India. A society called AFRICA (Public 
      Contri- butions-India) Fund to manage these contributions in Indian 
      Rupees was set <br>PG30<br>up. The Society has received 
      contributions totalling Rs. 2.36 crores including Rs. 1 crore each 
      presented by Coal India and the State Bank of India to the Pri me 
      Minister on Dec 10, 1988; the 40th Anniversary of the Human Rights

      reach Mozambique by March/April 1989. By the end of the financial year 
      1988-89, about 50 % of the total Indian contributions is expected 
      to be utilised or firmly committed. Negotiations are underway with 
      suppliers such as STC, PEC, TATAs, Mohan exports, MECON, HSCC and NSIC 
      for the remaining projects. Agreements on the implementation of Indian 
      AFRICA Fund projects have been signed with Botswana, Tanzania, Angola 
      and Mozambique. Agreements with Zimbabwe are being worked out. 
      Several other donor countries also have already initiated a number

      assistance in transport, human resource development covering 
      diverse sectors, agro-industry, agricultural sector and supply of 
      food-stuffs, medicines and other essential commodities. A 
      brochure on AFRICA Fund for distribution in USA and Europe financed by 
      the United Nations Centre Against Apartheid was released in New York on 
      28 July 1988. An Inter-Agency meeting of different UN organizations to

      CHAPTER VI 
      <br><br>EUROPE WESTERN EUROPE INDIA values its relations 
      with West European countries. A dense network of political, 
      economic, commercial, scientific, technological and cultural contacts 
      exists between India and countries in this region. The European 
      Community is India's biggest trading partner. In the area of joint 
      ventures, flow of investments, transfer of technology, the West 
      European presence in Indi a is increasing. A significant role is 
      played by them also in terms of bilateral assis- tance through 
      multilateral organizations. <br><br>In 1988 there were significant 
      positive developments in India's relations with the West European 
      countries as a result of an exchange of several high- level visits. 
      The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi visited the Federal Republic 
      of Germany in June 1988. The last visit by an Indian Prime Minister to 
      that count ry had taken place in 1971. Apart from holding talks 
      with Chancellor Kohl and other political leaders, the Prime Minister 
      met and addressed a select group of top German industrialists, 
      businessmen and bankers. The establishment of rapport at the highest 
      political level between the two countries, the decision to 
      maintain a political dialogue on a regular basis and stimulating the 
      interest o f the German business community in India were some of 
      the positive results of the visit. Prior to it, in March 1988, 
      signalling its increasing interest in I ndia as an economic 
      partner, the Federal Republic organised a major exhibition 
      "Technogerma" hi India. <br>PG33<br>PG34<br>The Prime 
      Minister visited Spain and Turkey in July 1988. This was the first 
      visit to Spain by an Indian Prime Minister. It was a timely visit in the 
      con- text of Spain's membership of the Community and the 
      significant economic progress achieved by that country in recent years 
      which has opened up prospects of fruitful economic and commercial 
      exchanges between India and Spain. The visit laid the groundwork for 
      positive developments in Indo-Spanish relations. In the last 
      few years relations with Turkey have developed very rapidly. Prime 
      Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit was in response to that of Turkish Prime 
      Minister Ozal's to India in 1986. During the visit a shipping 
      agreement and two agreements in the consular field were signed apart 
      from a railway contract between IRCON and Turkish Railways. Several 
      decisions on promoting cooperation in diverse areas were taken with a 
      view to establish a wider framework of relations. Earlier, the 
      Indo-Turkish Joint Commission had met in Ankara in May 1988 with the 
      basic objective of not only expanding commercial and economic ties 
      between the two countries but also developing the necessary 
      infrastructure to support an expanding relationship.<br> <br>The 
      President, Shri R. Venkataraman paid State visits to three West 
      European countries in 1988: the Netherlands, Finland and Cyprus. The 
      Dutch participation in several important areas of India's economy is 
      noteworthy and t his visit served to confirm the friendship and 
      understanding between the two countr ies and their shared interest 
      in developing mutually beneficial ties. The Finnish President, Mr 
      Koivisto had visited India in 1987 and President Venkataraman's 
      return visit continued the political dialogue which was 
      established between the two countries and which has served to 
      create a better understanding between the two, besides opening up 
      prospects on the commercial/economic side in the light of the 
      considerable economic progress made by Finland in recent years. 
      India has traditional ties of friendship and understanding with 
      Cyprus and the political dialogue and cooperation between the two 
      through exchange of visits and interaction in various fora is 
      well-established and mutually appre- ciated. President 
      Venkataraman's visit marked a continuation and consolida- tion of this 
      dialogue and an affirmation of India's interest in the preservatio n 
      of the unity, integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus. 
      <br>PG35<br>As against the outward visits from India to West 
      European countries,- du ring the year, there were incoming visits 
      to India by West European leaders also. T he Prime Minister of 
      Malta visited India from 7 to Jan 13, 1989, the last such visit from 
      the Maltese side being in the year 1968. Between Malta, a strategica 
      lly placed non-aligned country, and India there has been 
      interaction within the Non - Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth 
      and the United Nations. During the visit, possibilities of expanding 
      bilateral economic cooperation were explored. It was agreed that 
      an economic mission from India including rpresentatives from the 
      Government and the private sector would visit Malta in the near 
      future. <br><p></p></td></tr>

      <br>French President 
      Mitterrand visited India from 1 to 4 February 1989. He was present at 
      the inauguration in Bombay on 3 February of the year-long Festival of 
      France, the first return festival by a West European country. Indo - 
      French relations have over the years acquired a solid base. French 
      participatio n in key and sophisticated sectors of India's economy 
      has been valuable and to mutual advantage. Apart from discussions on 
      issues of global interest such as the North-South dialogue and 
      disarmament, President Mitterrand's visit served to renew a dialogue 
      at the highest level between the two countries in an atmosphere of 
      cordiality and mutual understanding with the aim of imparting new 
      dynamism and substance to mutual cooperation between the two. 
      President Evren of Turkey paid the first ever State visit by a 
      Turkish President to India (22 to 26 February 1989). This visit 
      constituted an importan t step forward in giving a political depth 
      to relations between the two countries . <br><br>Earlier, in October 1988, 
      Prime Minister Lubbers of the Netherlands made a transit halt in Delhi 
      and this provided a useful occasion for the two countries to have 
      an exchange on matters of bilateral and international interest. 
      The first round of discussions for the implementation of the 
      provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on economic, industrial 
      and technological cooperation between India and Norway was held in 
      Oslo in October 1988. It was decided to initiate measures to 
      strengthen trade, economic and industrial cooperation for which 
      several specific areas were identified. <br>PG36<br>Contacts with 
      Parliamentarians of West European countries continued to be 
      maintained. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha led Parliamentary delegations 
      to the European Parliament and to Turkey. Parliamentary 
      delegations from the European Parliament, Cyprus, Ireland, Austria and 
      Spain visited India during the year. Within the West European 
      region, India's relations with the Economic Community have special 
      importance. The Community is India's largest trading partner, 
      accounting for the largest chunk of India's international trade defici 
      t. India's interest in expanding her exports to the Community with 
      a view to achieve a better balance of trade is manifest. The progress 
      towards greater European integration through the establishment of a 
      Single Market in 1992 and its possible implications for the long 
      standing economic partners of the Community such as India is a subject 
      of considerable interest. India naturally hopes that the result of 
      the integrated Community will mean more and not less Indian 
      exports to West Europe. The Indo-EEC Troika meeting was held in Bonn 
      in June 1988 at which international developments of interest to the two 
      sides were reviewed. India is one of the few individual countries with 
      which the Community has arrangement for Troika meetings and it is 
      recognised that the importance of this dialogue will increase as 
      political cooperation within the Community under the aegis of the 
      European Political Cooperation grows.<br><br><p></p></td></tr>

      THE USSR AND 
      EASTERN EUROPE <br><br>India's traditionally close and friendly relations 
      with the USSR and the other socialist countries of Eastern Europe 
      further strengthened. There were many exchanges of visits at the 
      highest levels with these countries. These visi ts, as well as 
      exchanges at the lower levels and the decisions taken by the Joint 
      Commissions with many of these countries, gave added stimulus and 
      invested greater content to India's bilateral economic, 
      scientific-technical and cultura l ties with these countries. 
      The President, Shri R. Venkataraman paid a State visit to the USSR 
      in July 1988 in the course of which he had discussions on bilateral 
      matters and international issues with the Soviet leadership and 
      participated in the closing ceremony of the Festival of India in 
      the USSR. President Gorbachev visited <br>PG37<br>India in November 
      1988. Apart from extensive discussions with the President and the 
      Prime Minister, he participated in the closing ceremony of the Festival 
      of Soviet Union in India and received the Indira Gandhi Prize for 
      Peace, Dis- armament and Development. Mr Gorbachev's visit in 
      November 1988, his first visit abroad after becoming President, 
      provided the opportunity to both sides to reiterate their mutual 
      desire to maintain the tradition of regular hig h- level exchanges 
      which have given a new character and dynamism to Indo-Soviet relations 
      in recent years. During the visit, the Prime Minister and Mr Gorbache 
      v signed a Joint Summit Statement that sets out shared perceptions 
      on bilateral and international matters. Five agreements were 
      signed during the visit.<br><br> These are : an agreement on the 
      construction of a nuclear power station in India, a framework 
      agreement on the construction of hydro and thermal power stations with 
      a capacity of 6000 MW by 2000 AD, an agreement on economic and 
      technical credit for Vindhyachal Thermal Power Station (II), an 
      agreement on avoidance of double taxation and an agreement on 
      cooperation in the field of outer space. <br><br>There were frequent 
      contacts at the Ministerial level too during this peri od. These 
      included visits of Shri K.C. Pant, the Defence Minister, Shri M.L. Foteda 
      r, Minister of Steel and Mines, Shri H.K.L. Bhagat, Minister for 
      Information and Broadcasting, Shri B. Shankaranand, Minister for 
      Water Resources, Shri Madhavrao Scindia, Minister of State for 
      Railways and Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister of State for External 
      Affairs, from the Indian side. From the Soviet side, First Deputy 
      Prime Minister Maslyukov, Deputy Prime Minister Kamentsev and Defence 
      Minister Yazov visited India. <br><br>Bilateral trade rapidly increased 
      during this period to reach a level of Rs. 5200 crores in 1988. It 
      was agreed that this accelerated growth in trade should be 
      maintained in the coming years. The Trade Plan for 1989 has a target 
      of Rs. 7000 crores. In view of the modernisation and changing character 
      of the economies of the two countries, both sides felt that full 
      advantage shou ld be taken of the emerging complementarities in 
      the economies of both the countri es and changes brought about in 
      the structure of trade and new strategies for futu re cooperation. 
      These include greater involvement of Indian private sector in business 
      with the USSR, direct ties between enterprises, promotion of joint 
      ventures and production cooperation, Indian participation in the 
      development of the Soviet Far East and Siberia, and greater sharing of 
      the latest technologies. <br>PG38<br>The implementation of the 
      Integrated. Long Term Programme (ILTP) of Science and Technology 
      Cooperation signed by the Prime Minister and President Gorbachev 
      in July 1987 has given a new momentum to Indo-Soviet cooperation in 
      this field through intensified scientific exchanges and setting up of a 
      Join t Council to monitor implementation and coordination of the 
      ILTP. Eighty specific projects have been identified and over 100 
      scientists' visits have tak en place from each side. <br><br>The 
      unprecedented and unique Festivals of India and the USSR in each 
      other's countries gave a fresh impetus to all aspects of bilateral 
      relations. It was agreed that this momentum should be maintained. 
      A new Cultural Exchange Programme envisaging more intensive and 
      innovative exchanges was signed in November 1988. It was agreed to set 
      up an Indo-Soviet Nehru Foundation in order to provide a forum for 
      greater interaction between scholars and scient ists of the two 
      countries. Following the earthquake which devastated Armenia, 
      relief supplies con- taining Arctic tents; blankets, woollens, 
      hospital beds, stretchers, various ca te- gories of medicine and 
      medical equipment, were airlifted to Armenia. A special Fund 
      called "Prime Minister's Armenia Earthquake Relief Fund" was opened to 
      receive contributions from organizations and individuals. A National 
      Relief Committee under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State 
      for External Affairs, Shri K. Natwar Singh was set up to 
      coordinate relief supplies from India. <br><br>Relations between India 
      and Czechoslovakia were further strengthened with the visit of the 
      President, Shri R. Venkataraman to Czechoslovakia from 20 to 22 
      September 1988. The President had meetings with his Czechoslovak 
      counterpart, Mr Gustav Husak as well as with the General Secretary of 
      the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Mr Milos Jakes. It was agreed 
      that there was considerable unutilised potential for strengthening 
      bilateral economic and other ties. The Minister for 
      Information and Broadcasting, Shri H.K.L. Bhagat led India's 
      delegation to the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in July 
      1988 where the Indian entry Anantram was awarded a prize. 
      <br>PG39<br>Indo-Hungarian relations received a major impetus with 
      the visit of the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi to Hungary from 10 
      to 12 June 1988. During the visit, he held talks with the 
      Hungarian Prime Minister and General Secretar y of the Hungarian 
      Socialist Workers' Party, Mr Karoly Grosz, and also met the President 
      of the HSWP, Mr Janos Kadar. Both international and regional issues 
      were discussed as also methods to intensify bilateral economic 
      cooperation. An agreement for cooperation between the television 
      organizations of the two countries was signed during the visit. 
      <br><br>The 8th Session of the Indo-Hungarian Joint Commission took place 
      in New Delhi from 24 to 28 October 1988. The Indian delegation was led 
      by the Industry Minister, Shri J. Vengala Rao and the Hungarian 
      delegation by the Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Petar Medgyessy. 
      The major recommen- dations of the Joint Commission include enlarging 
      cooperation in industrial, economic, scientific and technical fields 
      and wider contacts between the two countries for transfer of 
      technology. It is expected that more non-traditional items would 
      be traded. <br><br>Shri K.C. Pant, the Minister for Defence visited 
      Hungary from 9 to 13 October 1988 at the invitation of his Hungarian

      countries in November. <br><br>Traditionally friendly relations continued 
      to develop with Yugoslavia. Close cooperation in the bilateral and 
      international fields, particularly in th e Non- Aligned Movement, 
      was further consolidated with the Prime Minister's visit to 
      Yugoslavia in July 1988. Agreements for cooperation in the fields 
      of informatio n, science and technology and sports were signed, 
      while the agreements in the fiel d of peaceful uses of nuclear

      CHAPTER VII 
      <br><br>THE AMERICAS NORTH AMERICA THE main thrust in 
      Indo-US relations during the period under review was towards 
      consolidating the positive trends that have developed in recent years. 
      Initiatives taken during the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in Oct 
      ober 1987 were followed up. These facilitated an expansion of 
      exchanges in the economic, scientific and technology transfer fields. 
      An indication of the improving climate in Indo-US relations was 
      the num- ber of high-level political and official exchanges which 
      took place during the year. From the US side, Defence Secretary 
      Frank Carlucci visited India in April 1988; Chief of the Army 
      Staff, General Carl E. Vuono visited in October 1988; and Ass is- 
      tant Secretary of Defence, Richard L. Armitage and Assistant Secretary 
      of State Richard W. Murphy visited in December 1988. Chairman of 
      the US House of Re- presentatives Sub-Committee on Asian and Pacific 
      Affairs, Stephen Solarz and tw o other members of the 
      Sub-Committee visited India and had wide-ranging discus- sions on 
      regional and bilateral issues with the Prime Minister, the External 
      Affairs Minister, Minister of State, Shri K. Natwar Singh and the 
      Foreign Secre tary. They also visited Punjab. An invitation was 
      sent by the Minister of Commerce, to the US Commerce Secretary Mr 
      R. Mossbacher to attend the Engineering Trade Fair in February 
      1989 at which USA is a partner country with the Confederation of 
      Engineering Industry of India. The Minister for External Affairs 
      visited New York to attend the UN General Assembly Session in 
      September/October 1988 and met President Reagan and Secretary of State 
      George Shultz. <br><br>Review meetings of the Memorandum of Understanding 
      (MOU) procedures on Technology Transfer were held with the US 
      government in January 1988 and again in March 1988 and January 1989. 
      Several details and modalities of the 
      <br>PG42<br>PG43<br>technology transfer arrangements were 
      worked out and a comprehensive system has been put in place. There is 
      a continuous dialogue underway to streamline exchanges and to 
      facilitate easier access of Indian industry to sophisticated t echno- 
      logies and products. It is expected that the value of US export 
      licences issued for controlled technology items in 1988 would be 
      close to US$ 1 billion. <br><br>The Cray XMP-14 Super Computer was 
      received in India in October 1988 and has been installed at the 
      National Centre for Medium Range Weather Fore- casting (NCMRWF) on the 
      premises of the Indian Meteorological Department in New Delhi. The 
      Government of India has applied for an export licence for another 
      Super Computer-the Cray YMP-132 for the Indian Institute of Science, 
      Bangalore. During the Prime Minister's visit in October 1987, 
      the Science and Tech- nology Initiative (STI) was extended for an 
      additional three years beyond 1988 . The formal extension of the 
      STI till 30 September 1991 was signed by Dr W.R. <br><br>Graham, Science 
      Adviser to President Reagan and the Minister of State for Science and 
      Technology, Shri K.R. Narayanan in October 1988. An important 
      issue pursued during the year was the conclusionof a treaty on 
      avoidance of double taxation. Most of the issues have been sorted out and 
      it is expected that an Agreement will be signed in 1989. 
      <br><br>The period under review continued the trend of cordial relations 
      between India and Canada. The whole range of issues in 
      Indo-Canadian relations were reviewed at the Annual Ministerial 
      Consultations (AMC) held in Canada in May 1988 and new areas of 
      cooperation were identified. Growing economic coopera- tion and 
      Canadian assistance for various projects in India were also assessed. 
      An important aspect in bilateral relations was the problem of 
      Canada-based Sikh extremists. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 
      Secretary of State Joe Clark followed a firm policy in suppressing 
      terrorism and abuse of Canadian laws and rights by terrorists. The 
      Punjab issue has acquired a certain domestic politic al dimension 
      in Canada and the Canadian government came under considerable pressure 
      for the release of two Canadians of Indian origin, Balkar Singh and Da 
      ljit Singh Sekhon, who were apprehended in Punjab for involvement 
      in extremist activities. <br>PG44<br>CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA 
      AND THE CARIBBEAN During the period under review India's 
      traditionally friendly relations wi th the countries of Latin 
      America and the Caribbean continued to develop satis- factorily. 
      Exchange of high-level visits and signing of bilateral agreements, c 
      on- tinued cooperation in international fora and India's support 
      for the aspiration s of the people of the region contributed to 
      the strengthening of bilateral ties. At the invitation of the 
      Government of Guyana, India participated in Com- memoration of the 
      150th Anniversary of the Indian arrival in Guyana on , 1838 505 o, . 
      the 150th Anniversary of the Indian arrival in Guyana on @@18380 A 
      high-level d elegation led by the Vice-President, Dr Shanker Dayal 
      Sharma visited Guyana from 4 to 9 May 1988. The delegation included 
      six Mem- bers of Parliament, senior officials of the Ministry of 
      External Affairs and representatives of the Indian Council of 
      Agricultural Research, Projects and Equipment Corporation and the 
      National Small Industries Corporation. <br><br>A composite manifestation 
      of Indian performing arts, a food festival, exhibitions of arts and 
      crafts, science and technology, books, photographs of Jawaharlal 
      Nehru, selected cartoons by Abu Abraham, a fashion show and a festival 
      of Indian films were held in Georgetown and other towns. The scale of 
      public and Government participation in various events was impressive. 
      Durin g the visit the Vice-President met with President Hoyte, 
      Prime Minister Green and other Guyanese leaders. Mr Rashleigh 
      Jackson, the Foreign Minister of Guyana visited India between 23 
      and 27 August 1988. He met the Prime Minister and the Minister for 
      External Affairs and discussed matters of bilateral and international 
      interest. <br><br>Following his visit to Guyana, the Vice-President 
      paid a visit to Suriname <br><p></p></td></tr>

      1988) and had wide-ranging discussions with President Ramsevak Shankar 
      and Prime Minister H. Arron. Possibilities of Indian cooperation in 
      developmental activities in various areas in Suriname were discussed- 
      The Vice- President also addressed a special session of the 
      National Assembly of Suriname . During his visit to Trinidad 
      &amp; Tobago (1 to 4 May 1988), the Vice-Presiden t had bilateral 
      discussions with President Noor Hassanali, Prime Minister Robinso n 
      <br>PG45<br>and other leaders. During his visit to the Parliament 
      House in Port of Spain, the Speaker's Chair gifted by India was 
      installed for the first time. The Speaker of the Trinidad &amp; 
      Tobago Assembly, Mr Nizam Mohammed visited India from 26 September to 
      3 October 1988. He called on the President, the Vice-President, 
      the Prime Minister and the Minister for Parliamentary Affairs. 
      Central America continued to be an area of tension. However, 
      following the Guatemala Peace Accord signed by the five Central 
      American Presidents in August 1987 and their meeting in Costa Rica in 
      January to review its compliance and implementation, there has 
      been a certain defusion in the situation.<br><br> On 23 March 1988, a 
      ceasefire agreement was signed between the Nicaraguan Govern- ment and 
      the Contras in the presence of President Ortega providing for freeing 
      of all political prisoners, guaranteed freedom of expression and 
      the return of exiles. Subsequent rounds of negotiations have, 
      however, been inconclusive. In May 1988 India co-sponsored a UN 
      General Assembly Resolution on "The Situa- tion in Central America: 
      Threats to Peace and International Security and Initia - tives for 
      Peace and Special Programmes for Economic Assistance". The Vice- 
      President of Guatemala conveyed the gratitude on behalf of the Central 
      American Governments for India's co-sponsorship and support. 
      <br><br>A welcome development was a Joint Declaration signed by the 
      Presidents of the five Central American States namely, El Salvador, 
      Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua, on 14 February 1989, at 
      La Paz which analysed the situation of the peace process in Central 
      America and adopted a resolution to ensure its validity. The 
      Declaration also endorsed the measures proposed by Nicaraguan 
      President Ortega to evolve a process of democratisation and national 
      reconciliation in Nicaragua. This holds out the prospect of promoting 
      the peace process in Central America. <br><br>Dr Carlos Salinas de 
      Gortari, the candidate of the ruling PRI (Institution al 
      Revolutionary Party) was elected President of Mexico in July winning 
      50.4% of the votes. The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri 
      K.K. Tewary represented India at the inauguration of President Salinas 
      in Mexico on <br>PG46<br>1 December 1988. President Salinas 
      granted an exclusive audience to Shri Tewary who handed over a letter 
      from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. President Salinas expressed Mexico's 
      keen desire to promote, intensify and expand bilater al relations 
      with India. <br><br>India and Mexico signed a Cultural Exchange Programme 
      for the years 1988-90. The Programme envisages exchanges between the 
      two countries in the fields of education, art and culture, radio and 
      television, cinema, sports and youth affairs. <br><br>The Foreign 
      Minister of Nicaragua, Dr Miguel D'Escoto Borckmann visited India from 
      20 to 23 August 1988. He delivered a letter from President Daniel 
      Ortega to the Prime Minister. He also met the Minister for External Affa

      President-elect. In a Presidential plebiscite held on 5 October 
      1988, the Chilean voters decisively rejected General Pinochet's bid 
      for eight more years as President. In an official statement, the 
      Government of India welcomed the democratic process instituted in 
      Chile and hoped that the process of restoration of democracy in

      CHAPTER VIII 
      <br><br>UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES <br><br>1988 was the 
      year of the United Nations. The UN Peace Keeping Operations was 
      awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. The Jawaharlal Nehru Peace Prize 
      was also awarded to the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Perez de 
      Cuellar. The patient and persistent diplomacy of the United Nations 
      was capped in 1988 by the signing of the Geneva Accord on 
      Afghanistan, the agreement on a cease- fire in the Iran-Iraq war, 
      renewal of intercommunal talks in Cyprus, the creati on of an 
      environment conducive to the resolution of the problem of Western Sahara 
      and the beginnings of the solution to the Namibia problem. 
      <br><br>India welcomes the reaffirmation of faith in the UN and its 
      ability to con - tribute to peace. India's active and constructive 
      role in the United Nations as well as in major international 
      conferences organised by the United Nations and its specialised 
      agencies in 1988 was geared to provide a boost to the return of 
      multilateralism. and the revival, of the active diplomacy of the 
      UN. The Minis ter for External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
      who led the Indian delegation to the Forty-third Session of the 
      General Assembly, summarised the Indian position on the principal 
      issues on the UN agenda in his speech to the General Assembly 
      which was addressed in Hindi on Oct 04, 1988. The dramatic 
      improvement in relations between the Super Powers benefited the 
      deliberations of the Forty- third Session and was applauded in his 
      speech. <br><br>Both the Commonwealth and the Non-Aligned Movement 
      benefited greatly from India's active participation and the interest 
      India took in enhancing the effectiveness of both NAM and the 
      Commonwealth on issues of primary concern. While welcoming the 
      detente and its positive impact on the role of the United Nations in 
      the political arena, particularly of regional conflicts, Indi a 
      was disappointed at the lack of progress in the international economic 
      field. <br>PG48<br>PG49<br>It is India's hope that the 
      United Nations which has contributed positively to the peace 
      process in 1988 will give equal attention to the solution of the many eco 
      - nomic problems faced by the developing countries in the 
      immediate future. Political Issues India welcomed the 
      adoption of the draft resolution on Afghanistan at the 43rd 
      General Assembly without vote and without debate. Earlier, while addres- 
      sing the Plenary, the Minister for External Affairs had said: "The 
      Geneva Accor ds (on Afghanistan) have established a framework 
      which would enable the people of Afghanistan to decide on their future 
      free from foreign interference or inte r- vention. While the 
      withdrawal of Soviet troops has proceeded as per schedule, we are 
      greatly perturbed at the persistent report of violation of the Geneva Ac 
      cords and hope that the Accords will be implemented faithfully by 
      all parties. In ad di- tion to restoring peace and stability to 
      the region, the implementation of the Geneva Accords would also 
      remove the ostensible cause for the introduction of sophisticated 
      arms into the area." <br><br>India termed Chairman Arafat's speech to the 
      General Assembly meeting at Geneva as "one of courage and foresight". 
      India welcomed the three-point framework of the Palestinian peace 
      initiative put forward by Chairman Arafat and hoped that it would 
      evoke a simultaneous and constructive response from Israel. 
      Earlier, India had supported the United Nations General Assembly 
      resolu- tion which shifted the venue of the UNGA debate on the 
      Question of Palestine from New York to Geneva, following the decision 
      of the Host Country for the UN Headquarters, to deny a visa to 
      Chairman Arafat of PLO who had wished to travel to New York to address 
      the General Assembly. <br><br>India continues to maintain that an 
      International Peace Conference on the Middle-East was the most 
      feasible and credible framework to resolve the Arab- Israel 
      conflict. This Conference should address the fundamental issues involved 
      : attainment by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right 
      to self-determi na- tion and the recognition that all States in 
      the region, including the States of Palestine and Israel and other 
      neighbours, have the right to live in peace and security within 
      internationally recognised borders. <br>PG50<br>India welcomed the 
      ceasefire between Iran and Iraq which came into effect on 20 
      August 1988. The External Affairs Minister said in his Plenary Statement 
      to the 43rd Session of the UN General Assembly that the: 
      "Ceasefire is an impor - tant first step and must be consolidated. 
      The negotiations between the two coun - tries currently underway, 
      under UN auspices, must be pursued." <br><br>India has also contributed a 
      contingent of 15 military officers to the Uni ted Nations 
      Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group set up pursuant to Security Council

      Resolution 619 of 
      1988, to verify, confirm and supervise the ceasefire and with - 
      drawal to internationally recognised boundaries. <br><br>The draft 
      text of the resolution presented to the General Assembly this ye ar 
      was different from the resolution passed in the earlier year. The 
      draft did not thrust legitimacy upon a group which had no claims 
      to it. It underlined support to regional initiatives. The draft 
      was more balanced in its identification of t he ele- ments 
      required for a just and lasting Kampuchean solution. India particularly 
      welcomed the call for "non-return to the universally condemned 
      policies and practices of a recent past" contained in the resolution. 
      However, the draft contained certain provisions which India could 
      not support. India was also disappointed that no determined effort had 
      been made to find consensus among the delegations principally 
      concerned. While abstaining on the resolution, India underlined that 
      this would in no way detract from its support to the diplomatic 
      efforts underway at the time to find a political solu tion to the 
      Kampuchean problem. <br><br>India continued to support the convening of 
      the Conference on the Indian Ocean at an early date but not later 
      than 1990, as stipulated in the General As sem- bly resolution on 
      the subject. India believes that the continued Great Power na val 
      presence in the Indian Ocean remains a factor contributing to tension 
      and in- stability. India reiterated the call for the withdrawal of 
      all military forces of out- side powers from the Indian Ocean, so 
      that it can emerge as a Zone of Peace. it is India's view that the 
      International Conference on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace 
      must be attended by all major powers which have military presence in 
      the Indian Ocean if the Conference is to achieve success. 
      <br>PG51<br>The Ad hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean had finalised a 
      consensus report and draft resolution for recommendation to the First 
      Committee. The resolution was subsequently adopted without vote both 
      in the First Committee and in the Plenary. As in 1987, 
      negotiations between treaty parties and non-treaty members failed to 
      produce a consensus text for a draft resolution on Antarctica in the 
      UN General Assembly in 1988. Two resolutions were subsequently 
      introduced in the First Committee. <br><br>Consistent with its 
      anti-apartheid policy, India voted for the draft resol ution 
      calling for the exclusion of South Africa from all meetings of the 
      Antarctic Tr eaty Consultative Parties. As for the 
      substantive draft resolution on Antarctica, India joined other 
      Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in not participating in the 
      debate on thi s resolution. <br><br>After six years of 
      negotiations, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties adopted a 
      convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources by con- 
      sensus, on 2 June 1988, at Wellington, New Zealand. India was a 
      party to the consensus. The Convention seeks to ensure that there is 
      no damage to the fragil e Antarctic environment in the event that 
      mining activity should ever take place on the icy continent. 
      Disarmament Issues During 1988 India played a leading role 
      in the three main multilateral dis - armament fora, viz., the 
      Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, the UN Dis- armament Commission 
      and the First Committe of the UN General Assembly. At the Third 
      Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament held in 
      June 1988, the Indian delegation led by the Prime Minister put forward 
      a number of new proposals including a far-reaching Action Plan for 
      ushering in a Nuclear Weapon Free and Non-Violent World Order. The 
      initiatives taken by <br>PG52<br>India arose out of the deeply held 
      conviction that global nuclear disarmament i s necessary for the 
      very survival of mankind. India has consistently maintained that 
      the arms race, in particular the nuclear arms race, will be finally ended 
      only when the doctrine of deterrence and the balance of terror 
      that goes with it, is given up. Only then will it be possible to 
      work towards freeing this world from <p></p></td></tr>

      nuclear weapons. 
      <br><br>Over the past decade, the arms race has proceeded at a 
      progressively accelerating pace. The world has been brought to the 
      very edge of a precipice. Increasingly, the realisation grew that 
      such a situation could not be allowed t o continue. The INF Treaty 
      and the relative relaxation in East-West tension constituted a good 
      augury for the Special Session of the General Assembly on Disarmament. 
      Our assessment was that SSOD-III provided a good oppor- tunity to 
      seriously consider changes in doctrines, policies, attitudes and inst 
      itu- tions required to manage a nuclear weapon-free world order, 
      rooted firmly in non-violence and faithful to the principle of 
      peaceful co-existence. Our large r objective was to further the 
      multilateral process of disarmament negotiations within the 
      framework of a time-bound programme and to move towards re- 
      structuring international relations based upon justice, equity, 
      universality an d respect for diversity. It is to further these 
      objectives that India tabled a ti me- bound and phased Action Plan 
      at the Special Session. <br><br>The Action Plan contains a package of 
      measures that structurally link the entire range of issues 
      presently on the world disarmament agenda. The Plan calls upon the 
      international community to negotiate a binding commitment to general 
      and complete disarmament-a commitment which should be total and 
      without reservation. The most essential feature of the Action Plan is 
      the achievement of the objective of elimination of nuclear weapons by 
      the year 2010 at the latest. The Action Plan is based on the 
      premise that the process of disarmament could not be confined to the 
      USA and the USSR. There should be a binding commitment by all nations 
      to eliminate nuclear weapons. All nuclear weapon States must join the 
      process without delay. Those States which are capable of crossing the 
      nuclear threshold should also assume corresponding obligations for 
      doing so. India specifically proposed that negotiations must commence 
      <br>PG53<br>immediately for a new Treaty to replace the NPT which 
      lapses in 1995 unless it is extended. This new Treaty should give 
      legal effect to the binding com- mitment by the entire international 
      community to eliminate all nuclear weapons by the year 2010. In 
      addition, two other initiatives were proposed by India relating to 
      "New Technologies and the Qualitative Arms Race" and "Disarma- ment of 
      the Warheads of Nuclear Missiles Covered by the INF Treaty between the 
      USA and the USSR". <br><br>In the Conference on Disarmament, the sole 
      multilateral negotiating body, India maintained its position of 
      principle and played a leading role in the Gro up of neutral and 
      Non-aligned countries. The Indian delegation coordinated the Group's 
      positions on the issues of "Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and 
      Nuclear Disarmament" and "Prevention of Nuclear War and Other Related 
      Matters". India continued to press for commencement of negotiations in 
      these areas as also for a comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Test Ban 
      Treaty. In the Ad hoc Committee on Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer 
      Space proposals on strengthening the existing legal regime were made 
      which attracted wide- spread support. Indian experts also participated 
      in UN-sponsored meetings of seismologists for monitoring a Nuclear 
      Test Ban and negotiations on a conven- tion prohibiting chemical 
      weapons. The Minister of State Shri K. Natwar Singh addressed the 
      Conference on Disarmament highlighting India's commit- ment and 
      contribution to the multilateral disarmament process. The Action Plan 
      on disarmament tabled at SSOD-III was submitted as a document to the 
      Conference on Disarmament to be considered in negotiations on a 
      "Compre- hensive Programme of Disarmament". <br><br>In the First 
      Committee of the UN General Assembly, India introduced a new 
      resolution on "Impact of Scientific and Technological Developments on 
      International Security". This resolution calls for an assessment of 
      scientific and technological trends and evaluation of their impact 
      on the international security environment with a view to ensure that 
      scientific and technological developments are used solely for peaceful 
      purposes and for the common benefit <p></p></td></tr>

      of mankind. The 
      resolution was adopted by an overwhelming majority. In addition, India 
      also presented a resolution on a Convention on Non-Use of Nuclear 
      Weapons which, as in previous years, was strongly supported by a large 
      number of States. The Indian resolution on Freeze on Production of 
      Nuclear Weapons and Fissionable Material intended for Nuclear Weapons 
      was merged with a similar resolution by Mexico enabling us to increase 
      our co-sponsorship as also the support in the General Assembly. In 
      addition to these, the Indian <br>PG54<br>delegation negotiated 
      on other issues especially those relating to chemical wea - pons 
      and confidence building measures where the resulting resolutions were 
      adopted by consensus. An International NGO Conference "Towards 
      a Nuclear Weapon Free and Non-Violent World" was held in New Delhi 
      from 14 to 16 November 1988. The Conference constituted one of the 
      first important events marking the com- mencement of Jawaharlal 
      Nehru's birth centenary celebrations. The Con- ference, in which most 
      of the important international peace movements and dis- armament 
      related organizations were represented, unanimously adopted a Joint 
      Statement which endorsed the Action Plan presented by India at 
      SSOD-III. The Joint Statement contains a number of new disarmament 
      ideas and propo- sals, many of which were put forward for the first 
      time in any international gathering. <br><br>Economic Issues 
      The Ord Session of the UN General Assembly was not able to sustain 
      the momentum generated by the positive outcome of the 7th Session of 
      the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII). In spite of 
      the con- tinuation of modest growth in the industrialised countries, 
      the developing countries continued to face serious problems. These 
      included, among others, the external debt crisis, protectionism and 
      continuing depressed commodity prices, stagnation in resource flows 
      and adverse external environment. The Second Committee in the Ord 
      Session did not achieve any meaningful progress in the areas of 
      traditionally held importance to developing countries. <br><br>The 43rd 
      Session of the UN General Assembly also addressed the issue of the 
      financial crisis facing the UN due to pendency of arrears of dues from 
      some member States, some long-term measures for increasing the 
      liquidity of the UN such as issuance of interest-free bonds, were 
      under consideration of the Secret ary- General. However, with a 
      partial release of US arrears of contribution, the financial situation 
      had eased somewhat. The Secretary-General is keeping the situation 
      under review. <br>PG55<br>The overall standstill in international 
      economic negotiations in the UN fo ra continued in 1988. The 
      developed countries persisted in their strategy of rega rd- ing 
      the role of the UN as a forum for exchange of views rather than serious 
      negotiations on development issues which are left to the domain of 
      specialised fora such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
      Trade (GATT), the In- ternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World 
      Bank. The major industria- lised countries also maintained the 
      tendency to consult and reach agreements on far-reaching issues among 
      themselves without the involvement of the deve- loping countries. 
      India's efforts in such circumstances were restricted to preventing 
      any erosion of fundamental positions of developing countries. The 
      Indian delegation played a useful role in negotiations leading to the 
      declarations adopted at the Ministerial Meetings of the Group of 
      77 and of the Non-aligned Countries, both held prior to the 43rd 
      Session. Discussions in the Second Committee were mainly on 
      external debt crisis and related issues, en- vironmental matters and 
      the proposal of the Group of 77 to convene a special session of the 
      General Assembly to reactivate growth and development in the 
      developing countries. Regrettably the resolution on debt had to be 
      voted upon for the second year in succession; in addition to the 
      negative vote of the Unit ed States, Japan abstained. The Indian 
      delegation played an active role in facili- tating consensus on 
      the resolutions on environment. A major achievement this year was in 
      obtaining agreement on the "main responsibility" of develop- ed 
      countries for combating pollution. <br><br>The General Assembly decided to 
      set up an ad hoc committee of the whole to formulate the international 
      development strategy for the Fourth Unit- ed Nations Development 
      Decade. It also decided to meet in a resumed session in February 1989 
      to take a decision on the proposal of the Group of 77 to convene a 
      special session on the reactivation of growth and development. The 
      resolution on fulfilment of target for official development 
      assistance (ODA) was another achievement of the 43rd Session. Wherever 
      the action sought was of a limited procedural nature such as in the 
      case of new and renewable sources of energy, global strategy for 
      shelter to the year 2000, international decade f or natural 
      disaster reduction, consensus was achieved fairly quickly. <br><br>At the 
      request of the Chairman of the Group of 77, India coordinated the 
      negotiations on the resolution on the report of the Trade and 
      Development Board . India also played an active role in the 
      resolution on the preparations for an <pg56>international 
      development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. 
      We lent strong support to the Nordic countries in their initiative on 
      the resolution on ODA. India's role in facilitating a consensus on 
      the resoluti on on food and agriculture by proposing balanced 
      formulations to take into account the interests of both food 
      exporting and food importing developing countries was highly 
      appreciated. India was a member of ECOSOC during 1988 and played 
      an active role in the second regular session. Important initiatives 
      were taken by the Group of 77 during the second regular session in the 
      area of environment. These included resolutions on additionality 
      of resources and increase in technical cooperation , strengthening 
      of the environment fund, traffic in toxic products and wastes and 
      dumping of nuclear wastes. The Group of 77 also took the 
      initiative in negotiat - ing a resolution on the revitalisation of 
      the Council itself. The role played b y India in amending the 
      resolution presented by the United States on entrepreneur - ship 
      to reflect national entrepreneurs including public sector and the role of 
      entrepreneurship in employment generation and acquisition of 
      technologies earned the appreciation of delegations from all sides. 
      The Pledging Conference for Operational Activities for Development 
      for 1989 showed an increase in nominal terms in the pledges for the 
      major funds and programmes of the United Nations. This was in part 
      attributable to exchange rate variations. However, the United States 
      continued to withhold contributions to the UN Population Fund 
      (UNFPA). India attended the first meeting of the Standing 
      Ministerial Committee on Economic Cooperation which had been set 
      up by the Eighth Non-aligned Summit in Harare. The Committee had 
      extensive discussions on new approaches to revive the North-South 
      Dialogue and means to intensify economic cooperation amongst 
      developing countries. It adopted a Declaration and issued a Press 
      Communique which highlights the salient concerns of the developing 
      countries in the present world economic situation. <br><br>India also 
      participated actively in the negotiations on the economic decla ra- 
      tion of the NAM Ministerial Meeting in Cyprus. Several of our ideas, 
      particularly on monetary and financial issues and the international 
      development <br>PG57<br>strategy for the Fourth UN Development 
      Decade 1991 to 2000 had been included by Cyprus in the initial draft 
      document. India also had extensive pre-conferenc e discussions 
      with delegations which have been active on economic issues. The 
      Cyprus Ministerial Meeting adopted a detailed paragraph on the Uruguay 
      Round on Multilateral Trade Negotiations. This was for the first time 
      that all Non-aligned countries identified and accepted specific elements 
      which can constitute a common position of developing countries in 
      the negotia- tions. India played a leading role in the 
      negotiations leading to this outcome. <br><br>In October 1988, India 
      hosted the first Inter-Governmental Consultative Conference of 
      Experts, of Non-aligned and Developing Countries on New and High 
      Technologies in New Delhi. This is a new area of cooperation in an 
      emerging field. The meeting was attended by experts of 20 developing 
      countries. Programmes of cooperation were identified in each of 
      the five theme areas of th e Conference. It was also decided that 
      this programme would be coordinated by the NAM Centre of Science and 
      Technology when it came into being. Till then the participants 
      requested the Government of India to coordinate these activiti es. 
      It is proposed to hold the first meeting of the Governing Council 
      of the NAM Centre of Science and Technology in March 1989. The 
      meeting is expected to approve the programme of work, the budget and a 
      formula for sharing of the expenses of the Centre. <br><br>The 
      Ministry also participated actively in all preparatory meetings and 
      finalisation of briefs for delegations attending international 
      conferences in t he economic field. In particular the Ministry was 
      largely involved in discussions relating to GATT, UNCTAD and 
      ESCAP. Administrative and Budgetary Matters The Fifth 
      Committee agreed to by consensus on a revised estimate of US 8 
      865.1 million for the United Nations regular budget for 1989. 
      Since 1946, it w as the first time that the budget of the 
      organization as a whole was not voted upon; <br>PG58<br>in the 
      past, one or the other major contributors have either voted against or 
      abstained from supporting the overall budget. The agreement on the 
      budget was facilitated by continuing progress in the administrative 
      and financial refo rms in the organization including agreement by 
      consensus in the Fifth Committee on the preliminary estimate of 
      1990-91 budget at US$ 1767 million (at 1988 rates) and its 
      recommendation to address further in 1989 the question of settin g 
      up a reserve to deal with additional expenditures due to inflation and 
      currency fluctuation for 1990-91. The negotiations on the latter 
      item were chaired by th e Indian delegation. The Indian 
      delegation, alongwith other developing countries, made efforts to 
      improve the geographical balance of the Committee on Conferences. The 
      newly reconstituted Committee on Conferences shall have 
      proportionately higher seats allocated to the African and Asian groups 
      in accordance with their larger numbers. <br><br>The Indian 
      delegation together with other developing countries was also able to 
      include a paragraph in the resolution on implementation of General 
      Assembly resolution 41/213 requesting for review of the proposed 
      high-level posts reduction in smaller offices of the Secretariat in 
      the areas of disarmame nt, economic and social development, UNEP, 
      and UN Centre for Human Settlement. All the four Indian candidates 
      to the various expert committees related to the Fifth Committee 
      were elected/re-elected for a new three-year term beginning 1 
      January 1989 by acclamation. These are: Shri B.K. Nehru (UN Investment 
      Committee), Ambassador Samar Sen (UN Administrative Tribunal), Shri 
      M.A. Vellodi (International Civil Service Commission) and Shri Yogesh 
      Gupta (UN Staff Pension Committee). Social and Humanitarian 
      Issues As in previous years, and in keeping with its principled 
      commitment to human rights and social justice, India continued to play 
      an active role in rega rd to the consideration of Social and 
      Humanitarian issues in the UN General Assembly, the Commission on 
      Human Rights and other related fora in the United Nations. In 
      recognition of this role, India was re-elected to the Human Rights 
      <br>PG59<br>Commission. Shri Murlidhar Bhandare, MP was also 
      elected to the Sub- Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and 
      Protection of Minorities. Shri Bhandare is currently serving as 
      Chairman of the Sub-Commission. Indian representatives 
      participated actively in the 44th Session of the Commission on Human 
      Rights held in Geneva in February-March 1988 and the 40th Session of 
      the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of 
      Minorities held in Geneva in August-September 1988 and also 
      contributed to the discussion on different aspects of standard setting 
      in the f ield of human rights. At the 44th Session of the 
      Commission on Human Rights, India made statements and moved 
      resolutions on the most serious human rights situations in the world 
      arising from apartheid in South Africa, the continued colonisation 
      of Namibia and the occupation by Israel of Arab territories, including 
      Palestine. India also continued to contribute positively to the on- 
      going exercise of drafting conventions relating to the Rights of 
      the Child and the Rights of Migrant Workers and also the on-going 
      discussion on the practical measures for implementing the 
      Declaration of the Right to Development which was adopted at the 41st 
      Session of the UN General Assembly. <br><br>The situation in Sri Lanka 
      came up for discussion during the 44th Session of the Commission 
      on Human Rights. The Indian delegation stressed that the situation had 
      undergone a change following the signing of the<p></p></pg56></td></tr>

      <br><br>Indo-Sri Lanka 
      Agreement to establish peace and normalcy in Sri Lanka on 29 July 
      1987, and that there was Widespread consensus that the Agreement's 
      full and satisfactory implementation would be of universal 
      benefit. It was also pointed out that the Agreement was structured 
      to meet the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Tamils of Sri 
      Lanka through an adequate and durable devolution of power within the 
      framework of Sri Lanka's unity and integrity and that it provided the 
      framework for a political solution. The Indian delegation emphasised that 
      no lasting solution could be achieved by violence or use of force 
      and appealed to all those who were opposed to the Indo-Sri Lanka 
      Agreement to give up their opposition, to eschew violence and to 
      join the peaceful democratic process which would enable all 
      communities in Sri Lanka to live in harmony and dignity. <br><br>The 
      year 1988 marked the 40th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
      Human Rights. At a ceremony held in New York to mark this 
      occasion, one of the five United Nations Human Rights prizes was 
      awarded to Baba Amte for his outstanding contribution to humanitarian 
      causes. <br>PG60<br>Apartheid The deteriorating conditions 
      in Southern Africa continue to be a focal poi nt of international 
      concern and indignation. The racist Pretoria regime on the one hand 
      escalated its repression within the country in an attempt to stifle di 
      ssent and opposition while on the other it stepped up its 
      terrorist activities across the frontiers against the neighbouring 
      independent States. Renewal of the state of emergency and a series 
      of repressive measures adopted against leading anti- apartheid 
      movements and individuals, as well as domestic and foreign media, 
      demonstrated once again Pretoria's desperate attempts to sustain its 
      illegal re gime through indiscriminate use of force and 
      State-sponsored terrorism. India voiced its strong concern at the 
      developments in Southern Africa in various international fora 
      including the United Nations General Assembly. It called for 
      complete dismantling of apartheid and also reiterated its appeal for 
      imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions againt the 
      racist regime of South Africa. <br><br>India also continued to play an 
      active role in the Special Committee again st apartheid and was 
      re-elected as its Rapporteur. India was also re-elected to th e sub- 
      committee on Implementation of United Nations resolutions and 
      collaboration with South Africa, the Task Force on Women and Children 
      under Apartheid and the Task Force on Political Prisoners. The 
      43rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly adopted eleven 
      resolutions on the Policies of Apartheid of the Government of South 
      Africa of which India co-sponsored nine. Each of these resolutions 
      was adopted by a large majority. The resolution relating to 
      International Solidarity with the Liberation Struggle in South Africa 
      called for increased support and contributi ons to the AFRICA Fund 
      of which India is the Chairman. <br><br>Decolonization In the 
      activities of the United Nations Bodies relating to the Decolonizat 
      ion, India was particularly active in the Special Committee of 24 
      and the United <br>PG61<br>Nations Council for Namibia. India's 
      Permanent Representative was re-elected as Vice-President of the 
      Council for Namibia and India was also elected Chairma n of the 
      Drafting Committee and Working Group of the Body. India 
      reconfirmed the availability of Major General (Retd.) Prem Chand to 
      lead the military component of the United Nations Transitory 
      Assistance Group in Namibia, and to provide Observers to the 
      United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) to verify the 
      withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. <br><br>Elections to UN Bodies and 
      other International Organizations India's role in the United 
      Nations was reflected in the results of electio ns to important 
      bodies. India was elected by acclamation to another term to the 
      Inter-Governmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards 
      of Accounting and Reporting, Commission on Human Rights and 
      International institute for Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT). 
      India's Permanent Representative was re-elected as Vice-President of 
      the United Nations Council for Namibia and India was also elected 
      Chairman of the Drafting Committee and Working Group of the UN Body 
      relating to Decolonization. <br><br>India successfully contested elections 
      to the posts of Secretary-General o f the International Civil 
      Aviation Organization and President of the Internationa l 
      Institute of Cotton. Activities of the Non-Aligned Movement 
      The changed international environment resulting from the Super 
      Power detente and the increasing consensus among members of the 
      Non-Aligned Movement to reform its practices and procedures with a 
      view to increase its effectiveness were the major pre-occupations of 
      NAM during 1988. The Move- ment also took a creditable initiative on 
      the Kampuchean question. Its focus on disarmament and economic issues 
      was maintained. <br>PG62<br>An extraordinary Ministerial meeting of 
      the Coordinating Bureau was convened in Havana in May 1988 to prepare 
      for the Third Special Session of the UN General Assembly devoted to 
      Disarmament. This enabled the members to coordinate their positions 
      during the Special Session. The Coordinating Bureau in conjunction 
      with the Committee of 9 on Palestine continued to monitor the 
      developments in the Middle-East. On 29 January 1988, it issued a 
      communique in-support of the popular uprising of the Palestinian 
      people in the Occupied Territories. It called upon the Security 
      Council to provide safety and protection to the Palestinian people in 
      these territories. The Coordinating Bureau of NAM in its meeting held 
      on 26 October 1988 in New York again condemned the brutal Israeli 
      practices in the occupied territories. The Committee of 9 first 
      met on 7 September 1988 in Nicosia prior to the meeting of the 
      Non-aligned Foreign Ministers. It issued a communique supporting the 
      "intifada" (popular uprising) of the Palestinian people and issued a 
      communique calling for the termination of Israeli occupation of these 
      territories and the creation of a UN Force to administer the 
      Palestinian territ ories over a transitional period pending 
      creation of a Palestinian State. The Commi- ttee of 9 also decided 
      to continue to work for the convening of an internationa l peace 
      conference on the Middle-East. The Committee of 9 met again in Geneva 
      on 14 December 1988 to support the three-point programme suggested by 
      Mr Yasser Arafat for the creation of a Palestinian State The 
      Non-aligned countries played an active role in arousing global opinion 
      on the issue of closure of the PLO Observer Mission in New York by 
      the USA and on the question of issuance of visa to the PLO Chairman 
      Yasser Arafat to participate in discussions on Palestine at the 43rd 
      UN General Assembly. <br><br>The Non-aligned Coordinating Bureau closely 
      followed the developments relating to the issue of independence for 
      Namibia. During the 43rd UNGA, Ministers and Heads of Delegations of 
      all Non-aligned countries expressed their indignation and concern at 
      the continued illegal occupation of Namibia. They urged the 
      Security Council to categorically declare that Walvis Bay and Offshore 
      Islands are an integral part of Namibia and as such, should not be the 
      subject of negotiations between South Africa and independent 
      Namibia. The Non-aligned Security Council caucus was united in its 
      efforts to prevent a scal ing <br>PG63<br>down of the UN Peace 
      Keeping Force to be deployed in Namibia. In October 1988, the 
      Coordinating Bureau of the NAM also declared the municipal elections 
      held in South Africa based on an apartheid Constitution, to be 
      null and void. The Coordinating Bureau of NAM, in April 1988, 
      focussed on South Africa's violation of Botswana's sovereignty and 
      territorial integrity, by its raid on Gaberone on 28 March 1988. 
      On 9 March 1988, the Bureau issued a communique calling upon the 
      US to desist from any actions that violated Panama's independence, 
      sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chairman of the 
      Non-Aligned Movement, as mandated, by the 8th Summit, set up a Senior 
      Officials' Group to explore the possibilities of NAM contributing 
      towards the search for a peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean 
      question. These officials met twice, in New Delhi on 15 and 16 July 
      1988 and in Harare from 15 to 17 August 1988 and submitted their 
      recommendations to the Chairman. The NAM Foreign Ministers Conference 
      in Cyprus in September 1988, set up a NAM Committee of 13 on 
      Kampuchea. This was mandated to work for the promotion of an 
      international conference on Kampuchea. Economic issues 
      continued to receive special attention of the Movement. The second 
      Consultative Meeting of Experts on the question of External Debt was 
      convened in Casablanca, Morocco from 22 to 25 February 1988. This 
      meeting reiterated the call for the convening of an International 
      Conference on Money and Finance for Development. The first 
      substantive meeting of the Standing Ministerial Committee for Economic 
      Cooperation was held in Harare from 4 to 7 July 1988. A document 
      entitled "Assessment of the current state of North-South dialogue and 
      proposals for its revitalisation" was adopted. A meeting of 
      experts was held in Pyongyang from 16 to 20 July to consider the 
      statute for the Centre for Irrigation and Drainage. Action is also in

      Centre for Science and Technology in India. <br>PG64<br>The NAM 
      Foreign Ministers' Conference held in Nicosia from 5 to 10 September 
      1988 noted that despite the detente between the USA and the USSR, 
      international relations were still characterised by the use of force, 
      intervention and interference. The need for the current detente to be 
      widened in scope, content and participation was stressed. 
      Recalling NAM's consistent support to multilateralism, 
      particularly with- in the framework of the UN, NAM Foreign 
      Ministers noted the initiatives taken by the UN during 1988. NAM's 
      commitment to seek a solution to the financial crisis being faced by 
      the UN was reiterated. The Ministers also calle d for the 
      transformation of the present world economic structure through coopera- 
      tive action on the basis of equity and justice. They expressed 
      their readiness to engage in dialogue for finding solutions in the 
      crucial and inter-related areas of debt, money, finance and trade. 
      The Ministers recognised that South-South cooperation would help 
      stimulate the economic growth of developing countries, facilitate 
      the achievement of collective self-reliance and enhance their counte 
      r- vailing power in international negotiations. <br><br>The 
      Ministers decided that the 9th Conference of the Heads of State or 
      Government of NAM would be held in Belgrade in Yugoslavia in 1989. 
      They decided to establish a Ministerial Committee to examine the 
      preparation and organization of NAM meetings, the content and format 
      of the documentation, forms and methods of action as well as the 
      effectiveness of its instrumentaliti es. The Ministers also agreed 
      to hold an extraordinary Ministerial Conference of NAM countries on 
      Peace and International Law to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the 
      First World Conference on Peace. <br><br>The NAM Meeting on Reforms and 
      Methodology appointed by the Foreign Ministers held in Nicosia from 13 
      to 16 January 1989, evaluated the rol e and methodology of NAM. In 
      keeping with their mandate, the Committee dis- cussed the various 
      suggestions on meetings, documentation, decision-making and related 
      issues. The Committee's work will be carried on by Chairman Cyprus who 
      will prepare a working paper for eliciting the views of all members. 
      The final report to be submitted to the 9th Summit Conference in 
      Belgrade would be based on suggestions received on that working 
      paper. This working paper would be discussed by the Committee on 
      Reforms and Methodology at Harare in May 1989 just prior to the 
      Coordinating Bureau meeting. <br>PG65<br>Commonwealth India 
      was in the forefront of the Commonwealth activities aimed at imple- 
      mentation of the decisions taken at the Vancouver Summit of the 
      Common- wealth in 1987. As a member of the Commonwealth Committee of 
      Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa which was set up by the Vancouver 
      Summit with a view to follow up the recommendations of the Summit 
      relating to Southern Africa, India contributed positively to the 
      Committee's deliberations on sancti ons against South Africa.

      <br>The four main 
      areas of activity of the Committee pertain to the widen- ing and 
      strengthening of sanctions against South Africa, the special needs of t 
      he Frontline States, the need to reach out to all sections of 
      anti-apartheid opini on within South Africa and the issues 
      relating to Namibia. As a member of the Committee, India has 
      agreed to make demarches both individually and jointly with those 
      countries which have been found to be increasing their bilateral trade 
      with South Africa. India has contributed to a joint study on South 
      Africa's links with international financial instituti ons with a 
      view to curtail such links. A number of important suggestions made in 
      the study have been recommended for adoption by Governments. These 
      include the banning of new lending, including new trade credits to 
      South Africa as well as a ban on insurance cover provided by 
      official credit agencies for lo ans to South Africa. The role 
      played by anti-apartheid and other NGO's in pressurising financial 
      institutions to cut off links with South Africa has been 
      emphasised. The Committee also examined in detail ways and means 
      of strengthening the arms embargo against South Africa. The Committee 
      also considered a report on the security needs of Frontline States as 
      well as the question of providing technical and other assistance to 
      Mozambique through the Special Fund. In response to the Canadian 
      strategy paper for counter- acting South African censorship and 
      propaganda, India offered to provide additional scholarships to South 
      African journalists at appropriate institution s in India as well 
      as to conduct a feasibility study in regard to a possible shor t 
      wave radio facility to be established in one of the Frontline States 
      for broad- casting to South Africa. The question of Namibia was 
      reviewed in some detail by the Committee. At its last meeting in 
      Harare the Committee hoped that the differences in regard to the 
      implementation of Security Council Resolution<br>PG66<br>435 
      would be resolved without impairing the ability of the UN Secretary- 
      General to hold free and fair elections. It was hoped that the 
      Commonwealth members would respond favourably to requests from the 
      Secretary-General for personnel in constituting observer components of 
      the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). The 
      meeting of Senior Officials of the Commonwealth was held in Seychelles 
      from 23 to 25 November 1988. The meeting reviewed progress in the 
      implementation of decisions adopted by the Vancouver Summit and made 
      preparations for the forthcoming Summit in Kuala Lumpur in October 
      1989. The Indian delegation was among the prominent participants. 
      <br><br>India also participated in the meetings of the Commonwealth Youth 
      Affairs Summit held in Samoa in May 1988, the Commonwealth Finance 
      Ministers' meeting in Cyprus in September 1988 and the Commonwealth 
      Health Ministers' meeting in Geneva in May 1988. India is actively 
      involved in the preparations which resulted in the setting up of the 
      Commonwealth of Learning at Vancouver, Canada. This institution is 
      mandated to promote Common- wealth-wide cooperation in the field of 
      distance learning. <br><br>International Law : Development and Activities 
      During the year under review, India ratified the SAARC Convention 
      on Suppression of Terrorism. Significant features of this SAARC 
      Convention were already reported in the Ministry's Annual Report of 
      last year. All the other countries of the SAARC have also ratified the 
      same and the Convention has come into force with effect from 22 August 
      1988. Necessary steps are also being taken to implement the 
      Convention under Indian law through enactment of appropriate 
      legislation. The 30th Session of the International Law Commission 
      was held in Geneva from 9 May to 29 July 1988. The Commission 
      discussed the Fourth Report on International Liability, the 
      Watercourses, the Sixth Report on the Draft Code of Crimes Against 
      the Peace and Security of Mankind and the Eighth Report on the Status 
      of the Diplomatic Courier and the Diplomatic Bag not 
      <br>PG67<br>accompanied by Diplomatic Courier. In addition, the 
      Commission also had a Preliminary Report on the Jurisdictional 
      Immunities of States and their Pro- perty and on State Responsibility. 
      As a result of its work, the Commission discussed 9 draft Articles 
      on International Liability, completed the first reading of upto 21 
      Articles on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses and adopted Articles 
      4, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 with com- mentaries thereto on the subject 
      of draft Code of Crimes. It also completed th e second reading of 
      the 33 draft Articles on the Status of Diplomatic Courier and the 
      Diplomatic Bag. <br><br>The United Nations Commission on International 
      Trade Law (UNCITRAL) after completing its work on the draft Convention 
      on International Bills of Exchange, transmitted the draft Convention 
      to the General Assembly with the recommendation that the General 
      Assembly consider the draft Convention with a view to its adoption or 
      any other suitable action to be taken. The Indi an delegation 
      supported the proposal for adoption of the draft Convention on 
      International Bills of Exchange by the General Assembly. The draft 
      Convention is designed to overcome difficulties arising from the 
      present disparities betwe en major legal systems of the world. The 
      draft Convention on International Bills of Exchange and 
      International Promissory Notes embodies a uniform legal regime for 
      International Negotiable Instruments. The new Convention would allow 
      International Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes to be denominated 
      as payable in monetary credits of accounts such as the Special Drawing 
      Rights. The United Nations General Assembly (Sixth Committee) 
      at its 43rd Session considered 14 agenda items during its 
      deliberations from 23 September to 1 December 1988. Out of 19 
      Resolutions/Decisions that were adopted, ten were adopted without vote 
      and nine by vote. India voted in favour of the Resolutions along 
      with a large majority of non-aligned and other developing countries. Ind 
      ia co-sponsored three Resolutions in the Sixth Committee on (1) 
      Peaceful Settle- ment of Disputes between States, (2) Report of 
      the Ad hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention 
      Against Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries and 
      (3) Report of the Committee on Relations with Host Country. It also 
      co-sponsored two resolutions on items (i) Co- operation between United 
      Nations and AALCC and (ii) Law of the Sea, dealt directly within the 
      Plenary of the General Assembly. <br>PG68<br>Among the main 
      highlights of the Work of the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly 
      at its 43rd Session, are: <br>(i) Adoption of a draft Convention on 
      International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes by 
      consensus. This is the result of the work of the UNCITRAL on this 
      subject over a period of 10 years. <br>(ii) While adopting the 
      Report of the Special Committee on the Charter Review, the General 
      Assembly adopted by consensus a declaration on the prevention and 
      removal of disputes and situations which may threaten international 
      peace and security and on the role of the United Nations in this 
      field. <br>(iii) The General Assembly also adopted by consensus a 
      draft Body of Principles for Protection of All Persons under any form 
      of Detention or Imprisonment, thus completing the consideration of 
      this Agenda item which was under consideration since 1975. 
      <br>(iv) The Sixth Committee recommended by a vote as part of the 
      considera- tion of the item "Report of the Committee on Host Country 
      Relations" to shift the venue of the General Assembly temporarily to 
      Geneva from New York to enable Mr Yasser Arafat, PLO Chief, to address 
      the General Assembly as he was refused visa to visit New York for 
      this purpose. As a result of the decision taken by the General As- 
      sembly, Mr Yasser Arafat was able to address the General Assembly 
      which was specially convened for this purpose in Geneva. 
      During the visit of the Prime Minister to Turkey in July 1988 
      India and Turkey signed two agreements on Mutual Judicial Assistance 
      covering civil and criminal law matters. The Agreement on Civil Law 
      matters provides for the issue of summons and letters of request for 
      examination of witnesses in eac h other's countries. The Agreement 
      on criminal law matters provides for exa- mination of witnesses and 
      transfer of documents and articles seized during crim i- nal 
      proceedings. These agreements will come into force in India upon issue of 
      Gazette Notifications under suitable provisions of the Indian 
      Civil Procedure Code and the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. 
      The Legal Sub-Committee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of 
      Outer Space (COPUOS) held its twenty-seventh session at Geneva from 14 
      to 31 March 1988 and considered legal issues relating to the extension 
      of the arms race into <br>PG69<br>outer space, the use of 
      neclear power sources in outer space, the definition an d 
      delimitation of outer space, the geostationary orbit and the adoption 
      of a new agenda item. <br><br>Expressing their grave concern over 
      the threat of extending the arms race into outer space, some 
      delegations stressed that every effort should be made to avert that 
      danger and that COPUOS, as well as its Sub-Committees could make 
      important contributions in that regard, playing a supportive role for othe 
      r international fora dealing with the problem of preventing an 
      arms race in oute r space. India also favoured this view but there 
      was no general agreement on the matter with some delegations 
      expressing the view that disarmament questions did not fall within 
      the competence of COPUOS. On nuclear power sources, the 
      Sub-Committee considered a set of seven draft principles relating to 
      safety assessment and notification; guidelines and criteria for 
      safe use; notification of re-entry; assistance to States; responsi 
      bility of States; applicability of international law and 
      compensation. During consi- deration by the Sub-Committee, two 
      more principles regarding the relationship with other 
      international treaties and settlement of disputes were added. 
      Regarding definition and delimitation of outer space many 
      countries including India stressed that it was a practical and legal 
      necessity in view of the different legal principles that were 
      applicable and considered the USSR working paper of 1983 to be a 
      good basis for a solution to the issue. Some delegations 
      reiterated their view that the lack of such definition or 
      delimitation had not created any practical problems in the 
      peaceful exploration of outer space and therefore there was no 
      immediate need for definition and delimitation. <br><br>Regarding the 
      geostationary orbit, some delegations expressed the view that there 
      were converging opinions among many delegations on the following 
      points: that the geostationary orbit was a part of outer space and was 
      a limite d natural resource which should accordingly be used in a 
      rational and economic way; that the geostationary orbit was not 
      subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of 
      use or occupation or by any other means; and that all States 
      should have equitable access to the utilisation of the geos ta- 
      tionary orbit. These delegations expressed the view that these 
      converging opin ions could form a basis of agreement on which 
      further work could proceed. <br>PG70<br>The Sub-Committee also 
      adopted by consensus a new agenda item entitled "Consideration of the 
      legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the 
      exploration and utilisation of outer space should be carried out for t 
      he benefit and in the interests of all States, taking into 
      particular account the needs of developing countries" based on the 
      proposal of the Group of 77 and subsequen t consultations. 
      The 27th Annual Session of the Asian African Legal Consultative 
      Com- mittee was held in Singapore from 14 to 19 March 1988. The 
      Session was successful in electing Mr Frank X Njenga of Kenya as 
      Secretary-General for a term of three years. He assumed office with 
      effect from 10 May 1988. Mr Nje nga thus replaced Shri B. Sen of 
      India who worked as Secretary-General of the AALCC mostly in 
      honorary capacity since its inception in 1956 until 1987. The Sessio n 
      also considered several legal items concerning the work of the 
      International Law Commission, international trade law, law of the sea, 
      law of refugees, law of extradition and the concept of peace 
      zones. <br><br>A list of treaties and agreements entered into by India

      <br><br>CHAPTER IX <br><br>FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
      <br><br>Bilateral Cooperation through ITEC INDIA remained firmly 
      dedicated to the cause of South-South cooperation and continued to 
      actively foster cooperation with fellow developing countries, 
      inter-alia, by offering technical and economic assistance under the 
      Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme 
      administered by the Ministry of External Affairs. A tangible evidence 
      of this objective is found in the expanding nature of activities 
      under this scheme largely as a result of pressing demand from the 
      beneficiary countries necessitating progressively high er 
      financial commitment year after year. The ITEC Programme when first 
      launched in 1964 had a modest outlay of Rs. 4.6 crores; during 
      1988-89 it crossed the mark of Rs. 20 crores, excluding expenditure on 
      similar activities in respect o f Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, 
      Bhutan and Maldives. The major components of the Programme, which has 
      so far covered over 70 developing countries across Asia, Africa 
      and Latin America, consist of project aid, techno-economic surveys, 
      deputation of technical experts in diverse fields, and training in spe 
      cialised fields, both civilian and defence, of foreign nationals. 
      A brief summary of ITEC activities that took place during the 
      current year in each of these fields is as follows : Project 
      assistance In this area Afghanistan, Mauritius, Vietnam, 
      Kampuchea, Laos, Ethiopia, Kenya and the Seychelles were the main 
      recipients. Decisive progress was achie ved towards supply of 
      equipment/consultancy services in respect of <br>(a) Construction 
      <br>PG71<br>PG72<br>of the Indira Gandhi Institute of 
      Child Health Expansion Project, Kabul, Afghanistan, and Jawaharlal 
      Nehru and Moka (Eye) hospitals in Mauritius, <br>(b) Common Facility 
      Centres (small-scale industry) set up with India's assistan ce in 
      Ethiopia and Afghanistan, <br>(c) Buffalow and Forage and Rice Research 
      Projects , Vietnam, and <br>(d) Pilot Weaving Project in Ethiopia. A 
      team of 16 experts from Archaeological Survey of India was also 
      despatched to complete Phase III of the prestigious Angkor Vat 
      Restoration Project. Order was placed for the supply of 4 Patrol Boats 
      to Mauritius worth over Rs. 2 crores, apart from taking in band of 
      fresh proposals from a number of friendly countries, including the 
      Philippines, Laos and Afghanistan. <br><br>Deputation of Experts 
      At the beginning of the year there were about 90 long-term (for 
      two or mor e years) Indian experts in position in various 
      countries, entirely at India's exp ense, except that expenditure 
      on accommodation was mostly borne by the host country. So far 
      requests for 127 additional experts have been received of which selectio 
      n of 64 experts has been finalised and 23 have actually left for 
      their respective assign- ments. Other cases remain under various 
      stages of consideration. Besides long-term experts, a total of 21 
      short-term experts have also been deputed on short-term 
      assignments to countries such as Mauritius, Afghanistan, Panama, 
      Vietnam, Ethiopia and Nicaragua. <br><br>Training As in the 
      previous years, training facilities continued to be provided in 
      India under the ITEC Programme to nominees of other developing 
      countries. Till December 1988, 358 persons had come for training for 
      periods varying from <p></p></td></tr>

    <td>
      six weeks to 
      three years. Another 80 persons are expected during the remaining 
      part of the year. Besides, 96 persons, who came last year, also 
      continued for various periods during 1988-89 to complete their 
      courses. Some of the areas in which training facilities are 
      provided under ITEC Programme are., Agriculture and Rural 
      Development including Development of Water Resources, Education, 
      Health, Industry, Manpower Development, Banking, Meteorology and other 
      fields. The civilian fields apart, nominees from a selected number of 
      friendly<br>PG73<br>countries also received training in the 
      defence field under the ITEC Programme, as well as, on 
      self-financing basis. This defence training has proved immensel y 
      popular and is in great demand. Beginning this year, the 
      Ministry also started looking after training of foreign nationals 
      under SCAAP and is expected to receive over 300 trainees from the 
      Commonwealth and other developing countries covered by the scheme. The 
      scheme, hitherto with the Ministry of Finance with a budget provision of 
      Rs. 50 lakhs, was given added impetus by augmenting financial 
      commitment to exceed Rs. 1.21 crores this year, expanding greatly 
      training facilities to cove r a larger number. <br><br>Other 
      assistance India continued to provide relief supplies consisting 
      of milk-powder, medicines, irrigation pump sets and pesticides to 
      famine affected countries of Africa. The Government of Yemen Arab 
      Republic was supplied with 200 tonnes of improved wheat seeds at the 
      cost of Rs. 12 lakhs and Vietnam gifted with forage seeds of a number 
      of plants. To Afghanistan medicines worth Rs. 20 lakh s per annum. 
      continued and several feasibility studies and techno-economic survey s 
      were either completed or proposals mooted in respect of Mauritius, 
      Vietnam and others following receipt of formal proposals through 
      our Missions. <br><br>Delegations from abroad With a view to 
      create a better awareness about India's scientific and technological 
      capabilities in Industry and Agriculture and other sectors, senio r- 
      level official delegations from 6 fellow developing countries 
      including Malawi, Uganda, Ghana, Yemen Arab Republic, Afghanistan 
      and Vietnam were invited. Over a period of time, this initiative is 
      likely to go a long way in generating political goodwill for India 
      and lead to a better appreciation of the suitabili ty of our 
      technical knowhow and developmental experience to requirements of other 
      developing countries and thus open up ways towards greater and 
      more meaningful South-South interaction.

      CHAPTER XI 
      <br><br>EXTERNAL PUBLICITY THE year longcelebrations of the birth 
      centenary of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indi a's first Prime Minister and 
      maker of modem India and one of the founders of the Non-Aligned 
      Movement started on Nov 14, 1988. These celebrations, along with the 
      40th Anniversary of India's Independence on 15 August 1988, served as 
      catalysts to the continuing efforts of the External Publicity (XP) Di 
      vision to project the image of a modern and dynamic India with a 
      rich cultural heritag e. The main thrust was to bring out India's 
      foreign policy perspectives, promote widespread awareness of 
      India's political resilience, economic, scientific and technical 
      progress already achieved, and counter anti-India propaganda through 
      misrepresentation of political developments in the country. 
      The XP Division continued to regularly brief the foreign and 
      Indian press about India's policy on various issues. The Division 
      continued to offer hospita - lity to select mediamen from all over 
      the world, and local hospitality to visit ing foreign mediamen, 
      and assist in their travel within the country to enable them to 
      meet a cross section of the Indian people. Indian Missions abroad kept 
      in regul ar touch with foreign media to brief them about the 
      current developments in India and provide them with factual 
      material on matters of current interest. To that end, the XP 
      Division provided information bulletins mainly by twice daily 
      transmissions to 75 missions/posts abroad. Besides, 48 missions 
      received bi- weekly press cables and 16 posts received regular 
      information bulletins by diplomatic bag. <br><br>The XP Division 
      continued to undertake the printing and publication of high quality 
      publicity literature on India depicting different facets of India' s 
      national life in the English, Arabic, French, German and Spanish 
      languages. These publications have been widely circulated by Indian 
      Missions abroad and have been found to be extremely popular and 
      useful. <br>PG77<br>PG78<br>For the year long birth centenary 
      celebrations of Jawaharlal Nehru which started on 14 November 
      1988, the XP Division has chalked out a comprehensive programme to 
      make a world wide impact : <br>(a) A photographic exhibition (in five 
      sets) on Nehru's life and times and his contribution to the making of 
      a modern and dynamic India is being organised in selected 
      capitals/centres of the world. The Missions are being supplied with 
      publicity material including folders and catalogues for distribution 
      during the exhibition. <br>(b) A 30-minute special documentary, 
      `Jawaharlal Nehru', has been prepared in U-matic and VHS cassettes and 
      is being supplied to all Indian Missions abroad. <br>(c) A large 
      number of special photographs and portraits for issuing postage stamps 
      abroad, and for other uses by local organizations, have been sent to 
      Missions abroad. <br>(d) Missions have been supplied with a model 
      advertisement announcing the beginning of the Nehru Centenery. 
      <br>(e) Children's films have been supplied to a number of Missions. 
      Indian Missions shall also be organising film weeks as part of the 
      Centenary celebrations. <br>(f) A 16-mm documentary on Jawaharlal 
      Nehru has been supplied to a number of Missions. <br>(g) Articles 
      on Jawaharlal Nehru with matching photographs have been supplied for 
      bringing out special issues/supplements/articles by news- papers and 
      journals being published abroad. These have also been used by Indian 
      Missions for their journals. <br>(h) India-Perspectives, the elegant 
      monthly journal of the XP Division, devoted its November 1988 issue to 
      Jawaharlal Nehru. <br>(i) Tributes paid to Jawaharlal Nehru at the 
      time of his death by world leaders and leading 
      newspapers/journals/magazines have been collected and supplied to 
      Missions abroad for their selective use. <br>(j) Nehru-folders brought 
      out by Jawaharlal Nehru Implementation Committee are being purchased 
      in bulk for supply to Indian Missions abroad. <br>PG79<br>The XP 
      Division helped to bring into international focus, the operations 
      of the Indian forces at the invitation of the Maldives Government 
      in November 1988 to suppress the coup attempt by mercenaries. The 
      Division took 35 Indian <p></p></td></tr>

      and foreign 
      mediamen to Male during the operations for on the spot reporting. 
      The coverage in the international media has been extensive and on 
      the whole extremely positive. The Division continued to get in focus 
      the on-going ethnic problem in Sri Lanka and the operations of the 
      Indian forces there. On the first anniversary of the signing of 
      Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, the XP Division brought out an attractive 
      publication in English, Arabic, French, German and Spanish, and 
      another publication of high quality highlighting ethnic issues in the 
      English and Tamil languages. <br><br>From July 1988, the XP Division 
      started bringing out a high quality monthl y journal in colour and 
      black and white, namely, India-Perspectives in the Englis h, 
      French and Spanish languages. The earlier fortnightly magazine Indian 
      and Foreign Review and its French counterpart Courrier de L'Inde were 
      discontinued. Apart from the publication of monthly Foreign 
      Affairs Record, the XP Division brought out about a dozen high 
      quality publications in the English, Arabic, French, German and 
      Spanish languages as the occasion demanded, some of these of regular 
      nature like the Prime Minister's statements on foreign policy, some 
      others of a general nature and some relating to specific occasions 
      to achieve optimum results. <br><br>The External Publicity 
      Division is placing increasing emphasis on the cir- culation of 
      audio-visual material by Indian Missions abroad. They have been 
      equipped with TV sets and Video Cassette Recorders. Missions abroad 
      have also been provided with video libraries depicting India's 
      agricultural, industr ial, scientific and technological progress 
      and different facets of India's cultural heritage, apart from 
      topics of contemporary interest. In close cooperation with Door- 
      darshan, the External Publicity Division is regularly sending a weekly 
      Televisi on capsule titled India Magazine to Indian Missions 
      abroad about developments in India. The capsules have been widely 
      welcomed and are also being used by the national television stations 
      in a number of countries, for viewing by their public. These 
      programmes are also being lent by Indian Missions abroad to 
      individuals, cultural organizations and educational institutions for wider 
      impact. The programmes have proved to be particularly useful in 
      catering to the needs of the Indian community and the people of Indian 
      origin abroad.<br> <br>PG80<br>The weekly India Magazine TV capsules 
      are being used extensively by the Indian ethnic television programmes 
      in the USA and Canada. A monthly news summary Dateline is especially 
      prepared with the cooperation of Doordarshan and sent for use by the 
      ethnic TV stations in these countries. These are being viewed not 
      only by the Indian community but also by others. Missions in five 
      of India's neighbouring countries have been provided with dish 
      antennae to enable these Missions to tune into programmes telecast by the 
      different stations of Doordarshan. These are in Indian Missions in 
      Bhutan, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The installation of 
      dish antennae at the Mission in Islamabad is being processed. 
      To meet the increasing demand for Indian films across the world, 
      the XP Division is getting sub-titled in the English, Arabic, French 
      and Spanish langu ages, 17 titles of films for wider circulation 
      and screening by Missions abroad. The XP Division also provided 
      the Missions with documentary films produced by Films Division on 
      different aspects of India's national life. The Division is 
      assisting in the production of two documentaries namely, India 
      within India, and India-Continuity in Change. Another documentary on 
      Jawaharlal Nehru has already been produced and is in circulation. The 
      XP Division has obtained distribution rights of M/s Asian Films 
      Production Mahatma Gandhi's Vision : India's Tryst with Freedom, for 
      wider viewing through Indian Missions abroad. <br><br>The photo 
      libraries of Missions abroad containing photographic slides on 
      different facets of development of India are being continuously 
      strengthened. The Missions are being regularly supplied with 
      photographs of current develop- ments in India. During nine months 
      ending December 1988, about 24,000 news photographs and 100 colour 
      transparencies were sent to Indian Missions abroad. <br><br>During the 
      year under review, the XP Division made complete logistical 
      arrangements with the help of Indian Missions abroad and of other 
      agencies wher e necessary, for the media parties which accompanied 
      the following Indian leaders on their visits abroad : the 
      President on his visit to the USSR and Mongolia 6 to 20 July 1988; 
      Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Cyprus and Finland 12 to 23 September 
      1988; Bhutan 18 to 21 October 1988; of the Vice-President to Guyana 
      4 to 14 May 1988 and the Prime Minister to Japan 15 to 17 April 
      1988; Yugoslavi a, Jordan, Spain and Turkey 11 to 20 July 1988; 
      Bhutan 23 to 25 September 1988; China 19 to 23 December 1988 and 
      Pakistan 29 to 31 December 1988. On these <br>PG81<br>occasions 
      press kits and audio-visual material were sent to Indian Missions abr 
      oad in the countries concerned for a pre-publicity build-up. 
      Similarly, the XP Div ision made logistical arrangements including 
      press conferences for visiting dignitari es and the accompanying 
      media parties. <br><br>The XP Division continued to subscribe to the 
      feature news services of new s agencies and commissioned special 
      articles on the occasion of the Republic Day and the Independence 
      Day for dissemination abroad. The publication of special 
      supplements on India by foreign newspapers/journals/magazines were 
      facilitated. <br><br>With the assistance of the Ministry of Home 
      Affairs, the XP Division con- tinued to regularly brief Indian 
      Missions abroad on the developments in the Punjab and to counter 
      extremist propaganda against India. The Missions abroad have 
      adopted a multi-pronged approach, including keeping in close touch with 
      the resident Indian communities to brief them regularly about the 
      developments in India including the situation in the Punjab, with 
      a view to isolate the host ile elements. The Missions are being 
      provided with journals/magazines projecting developments in the Punjab 
      in a balanced way. Selected Missions abroad are also being provided 
      with information from the Punjab Government about the developments in 
      that State. <br><br><p></p></td></tr>

      CHAPTER XII 
      <br><br>CULTURAL RELATIONS SINCE 1950 the Indian Council for 
      Cultural Relations (ICCR) has worked steadily to project the cultural 
      image of India abroad and to bring to India the finest manifestations 
      of culture from abroad. With a network of seven regional offices and 
      five cultural centres abroad, and with the active assistan ce of 
      Indian Missions abroad, the Council has succeeded in taking India's 
      culture to the farthest corners of the world. <br><br>The 
      activities of the Council in 1988-89 followed the trends established i 
      n earlier years. The Council continued its focus on 
      countries and regions having traditiona l and historical ties with 
      India and with developing countries in Asia, Africa an d Latin 
      America. Like the Centre for Africa, which was set up in the Council 
      in 1986-87, two other centres viz., the Centre for Latin America and 
      the Centre for South and South-East Asia have also started 
      functioning under the aegies of the Council. More intensive 
      cultural exchanges have taken place with these regions during the year 
      under review than in any period in the past. The shift of the 
      Council's focus from the advanced western countries to the 
      developing countries is reflected in the following statement

      for Festival of India. **Includes troupes sent for the 
      International Ocean Festival in Mauritius in Se ptember 1987. 
      <br>PG82<br>PG83<br>During 1988-89 the Council continued to 
      involve itself with the work relat - ing to selection, travel 
      arrangements and presentation of artistes from India a t the 
      Festival of India in the USSR. The Council was also assigned the task of 
      presenting the major cultural troupes of the Festival of the Soviet 
      Union in In dia. The selection of the artistes for the 
      Festivals abroad in the USSR and oth er countries was done in an 
      objective and impartial manner with the assistance of Advisory 
      Panels of specialists in the fields of dance, music, theatre and folk 
      arts. A special feature of the selections has been the promotion 
      of young talent. A number of outstanding young performing artistes 
      were given an opportunity to participate in Festivals abroad. In fact, 
      in the field of dance, the young perf or- mers exceeded the number 
      of the established artistes. <br><br>Four new sections were opened within 
      the Council, viz : - Audio-Visual Reference - Contemporary 
      Arts - Traditional Arts and Crafts - In-House 
      Publications. This reflected the growing importance of these areas 
      in the Council's acti vities. Two new Cultural Centres were 
      set up in Jakarta and Mauritius. The year-long Festival of India 
      in the USSR and the Soviet Festival in Ind ia, in which the 
      Council was entrusted with the Performing Arts, ended on Jul 08, 1988 
      and 19 November 1988 in Moscow and New Delhi respectively. While 
      Shri R. Venkataraman, the President of India, went to Moscow to be 
      present at the time of the closing ceremony of the Festival of 
      India in the USSR, the Sovi et President Mikhail Gorbachev, 
      witnessed the closing ceremony in New Delhi of the Soviet Festival in 
      India. <br><br>The highlights of the Soviet Festival in India were the

      <br><br>CHAPTER XIII <br><br>INDIANS OVERSEASIT estimated that 
      there are about 12 million persons of Indian origin resi - ding in 
      different parts of the world which include those having Indian nationa- 
      lity. The phenomenon of Indians travelling overseas is not a new 
      one and dates back to time immemorial. Large number of persons of 
      Indian origin were also settled abroad during the colonial period and 
      have made contributions to t he economic development of the 
      countries of their residence. In the last few decad es a number of 
      Indian nationals have emigrated to the Gulf, Western Europe and the 
      USA. They too have made a marked contribution in a variety of 
      fields. The overseas Indians are increasingly being recognised as a 
      valuable asset for Indi a as a bridge of understanding between 
      India and the country of their domicile. <br><br>In May 1988, the 150th 
      anniversary of Indian emigration to Guyana was celebrated in 
      Georgetown which was attended by a high-level Indian delegation 
      headed by the Vice-President of India, Dr Shanker Dayal Sharma. 
      During this visit the Vice-President also went to Suriname and 
      Trinidad Tobago and these visits contributed to the 
      strengthening of India's relations with all three cou ntries as 
      well as the cultural and emotional links with the Indian communities 
      there. <br><br>A Special Coordination Division was set up in the 
      Ministry with a view to develop social, economic and cultural 
      contacts between India and the overseas Indians. Indian Missions 
      have been asked to maintain close contacts with overseas Indians and 
      render them all possible assistance. This unit also dissem i- 
      nates information about matters of interest to overseas Indians like 
      investment procedures in India through the Missions abroad. It 
      also represents the Ministr y in inter-Ministerial deliberations 
      involving NRI affairs. <br><br>It is the consistent policy of the 
      Government that persons of Indian origi n who have taken foreign 
      nationality should identify themselves with and integrat e in the 
      country of their domicile. The Government naturally, remains alive to, 
      their interest and general welfare and encourages cultural 
      contacts with them. <p></p></td></tr>

      CHAPTER XV 
      <br><br>PASSPORT AND CONSULAR SERVICES PRESENTLY there are 21 
      Passport Offices, spread over the country and two Liaison Offices 
      (Shimla and Trivandrum). It has been decided to open some more 
      Passport Offices/Liaison Offices. <br><br>A statement showing the number 
      of applications for fresh passport/misc. services received and the 
      number of passports issued/misc. services rendered fo r the period 
      1 January to Dec 31, 1988, is given at Appendix VI. The total revenues 
      earned by the passport offices from January to December 1988 was Rs. 
      13.18 crores. The total expenditure incurred upto December 1988 stood at 
      Rs. 4.72 crores. A detailed statement in this regard is given at 
      Appendix VII. A system of regular inspections and monitoring 
      of passport offices has bee n devised. So far, 19 teams of 
      Officers have inspected various passport offices. Added to this, 
      some of the passport offices were visited by the Minister of Sta te 
      for External Affairs and Officers of the CPV Division. 
      Passport Adalats were successfully held in passport offices at 
      Jalandhar, Chandigarh and Jaipur by the Chief Passport Officer and 
      some of the Senior officials of the Passport Organization. This was 
      very much appreciated by the press and the public. 
      Training facilities at Institute of Staff Training Management 
      (ISTM) were fully utilised for imparting training to the officials 
      in `Cash and Accounts' a nd `Vigilance matters'. A beginning was 
      made to get officers trained in `Public Relations' and 
      `Behavioural Skills' at FSTI. After the police and CID reports 
      were made compulsory before the actual issue of passports, the 
      workload in passport offices increased considerably although the 
      sanctioned strength of personnel has remained the same as before. 
      Steps are being taken to get the Staff Inspection Unit (SIU) norms 
      revised in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. 
      <br>PG94<br>PG95<br>Six passport offices, namely, Delhi, 
      Bombay, Madras, Cochin, Goa and Lucknow have been computerised. 
      Computer sites at passport offices at Banga-lore, Hyderabad, 
      Bhopal and Chandigarh are ready to receive computers whereas site 
      preparation at passport offices at Jaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Ahmedabad is 
      nearing completion. Computer site preparation at the passport 
      office at Calcutta is also being taken up. New office 
      accommodation for passport office at Patna is being obtained which 
      will have provision for a computer room. Computer site at Srinagar 
      passport office would be prepared by the State Government of Jammu 
      and Kashmir. A computer unit has also been installed at the CPV 
      Division. A high powered committee under the Chairmanship of 
      Secretary (E E R) had been set up to review all aspects of the 
      functioning of the passport offices. This Committee has already 
      reviewed problems connected with issue of passports in order to 
      improve efficiency without compromising the security aspect. The 
      Committee has recommended introduction of more secured passport 
      (MSP) booklets with effect from 1 July 1989. As part of the 
      on-going drive to improve efficiency, steps have been taken in 
      consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs to expedite police 
      verification of passport applicants. Delayed and incomplete 
      reports are being regularly moni- tored and reviews are taken up 
      at a higher level. Chief Ministers of all the S tate Governments, 
      Chief Secretaries and State Home Secretaries were approached to help 
      expedite police reports of passport applicants from their respective St 
      ates. <br><br>During the year 1988, there were 1920 cases of 
      registered complaints on delay in issue of fresh passports or renewal 
      thereof. They were computerised a nd followed up successfully. As 
      a result, 1325 complaints were settled by issuing passports and 
      rendering the desired services. Forty-six cases of appeals again st 
      the order of impounding or refusal of passport facilities to Indian 
      nationals by <p></p></td></tr>

      the passport 
      offices were received. In 33 cases, the Chief Passport Officer he ard 
      the appeals and passed orders. Other cases of appeals are in the 
      process of consideration. About 102 cases of forgery of 
      entries in passports and visas were reported to the Ministry. 
      Investigations are being made in all these cases of forgeries. 
      Three hundred and seventy seven applications were received for 
      issue of certificate of Identity of Stateless persons, most of them 
      being Tibetan refugees.<br><br>In most of the cases, certificates of 
      Identity were issued to the applicants. <br>PG96<br>twenty-eight 
      requests were received from Indian passport holders for grant <br>of 
      endorsement for South Africa. Almost all the cases were disposed of on 
      merits. <br><br>During the year, 149 fresh applications from Travel 
      Agents were received for recognition to deal with the passport 
      offices in passport matters under the new criteria introduced with 
      effect from September 1986. One hundred and eighty-eight Travel 
      Agencies were approved and recognised while 112 applica- tions were 
      rejected for non-fulfilment of prescribed criteria. (These figures a 
      lso include the applications received before 1988). As on 31 
      December 1988, 583 Travel Agencies were recognised to deal in passport 
      matters in the country. <br><br>During the year, plots of land and 
      passport offices at Ahmedabad and Panaji were acquired for 
      constructing office-cum-residential building for passp ort 
      offices. There are proposals to construct office-cum-residential 
      buildings for passport offices at Kozhikode, Cochin, Bhubaneshwar 
      and Jaipur. <br><br>Consular Matters During 1988, 458 cases of 
      deportation of Indian nationals by foreign govern-ments were 
      brought to the notice of the Ministry. Most of them originated from 
      the Gulf countries. Indian Missions and posts abroad, repatriated 
      88 persons, who were in distress in foreign countries. Financial 
      assistance was extended to deserving cases. Cases of 337 Indian 
      nationals arrested in various countries were reported to the 
      Government. Every consular assistance was rendered to them and 
      wherever possible their release and return to India was facilitated by 
      the Missions concerned. <br><br>Three hundred and ninety-one cases 
      of death of foreign nationals in India were also handled. Three 
      hundred and eleven cases of death of Indian nationals <p></p></td></tr>

      abroad came to 
      the notice of the Ministry and actions were initiated to settle 
      their claims of dues and death compensation through respective 
      Indian Missions. <br><br>Consular assistance was also rendered in all 
      cases of labour disputes brought to the notice of the Indian 
      Missions abroad. One lakh six thousand nine hundred and 
      seventy-eight documents-received from the public for submission to 
      foreign authorities were attested/authenticated by the Consular 
      Section of the CPV Division. The procedure for authentication 
      <br>PG97<br>of documents has been streamlined so as to enable 
      the public to get back the docu- ments duly attested on the same 
      day. There is no service charge at present for consular 
      attestation by the Ministry. During 1988, Visa fees were revised 
      in respect of 37 countries. On a reci - procal basis, visa fee has 
      been abolished for the nationals of Zimbabwe. The provisions 
      relating to the grant of long-term multiple entry visas were further 
      liberalised. Certain categories of businessmen and technicians 
      belonging to UK, FRG and Japan are now extended such visa facilities 
      on a reciprocal basis. <br>The requirement of visa application forms 
      and photographs has been waived for Indian and US Diplomatic/Official 
      passport holders when they apply for visas in New Delhi and 
      Washington respectively. The Southern African State of Botswana has 
      introduced a visa regime for Indian nationals with effect from 
      March-1988. <br><br>In 1988, a total of 1699 Diplomatic passports and 
      7095 Official passports were issued by the CPV Division. One 
      thousand five hundred and ninety consular services on diplomatic 
      passports and 6633 services on official passports were rendered. 
      About 16,200 visa notes requesting foreign diplomatic Missions in 
      India to issue Diplomatic/Official visas were also issued. 
      Computerisation of Diplomatic and Official passports issued by the 
      Ministry has begun from this year. <br><br><p></p></td></tr>

      in Rome and Lilongwe were purchased; a Chancery-cum-residential 
      complex in Mahe and a new Chancery in Athens were purchased. The 
      Ministry also decided to acquire land in Bonn and Baghdad for the 
      construction of Chancery and residences, and is finalising 
      purchase of plots for staff residences at Dar-es-Salaam and Nicos ia. 
      The project for the construction of Chancery in Islamabad has been 
      completed and the Embassy has begun functioning from the new premises. 
      The project at Kuwait to house the Chancery, Embassy Residence and 
      some accommodation for officers as well as the project at Lagos for 
      the construction of Chancery and t he entire residential 
      requirements were initiated in May 1988. Both will be com- pleted 
      by early 1990. Preparations for the projects for Chancery and residence 
      at Dubai, Chancery of the PMI and a housing complex for officials 
      at New York and Chancery and housing at Kuala Lumpur are under way 
      and construction is expected to begin early in next financial year. 
      Approval for the projects f or the construction of Chancery and 
      Embassy Residence at Doha has been given and similar projects at Abu 
      Dhabi and Brasilia are being finalised. <br><br>Indian Missions at Hanoi, 
      Phnom Penh, Vientiane, Doha, Muscat, Baharain and Colombo were 
      inspected during the current financial year. Review of the regulation 
      governing entitlement of Government of India's officials posted abro 
      ad was undertaken to simplify the procedures. 
      <br>PG101<br>Nearly 1500 employees, who are recruited locally are 
      also on the rolls of Indian Missions and Posts abroad. During the 
      last two years the Ministry evolv ed systems which will protect 
      their emoluments and improve their conditions of service in several 
      countries where the local currency is vulnerable to major fl uctua- 
      tions. Administrative measures for the standardisation of the 
      conditions of se r- vice are being finalised. 
      Computerisation of information in various sections of the 
      Establishment Division was undertaken so that access to rules and 
      regulations as well as thei r interpretation, data on all aspects 
      of the conditions of service of locally rec ruited staff in 
      Missions, property questions as well as matters relating to supplies t 
      o Missions abroad can be speeded up through the use of computers. 
      The soft- ware is already under preparation and the work will be 
      completed before the end of the year. The Conference Cell 
      continued to play a useful role in providing logistica l support 
      and managerial assistance for all the international conferences convene 
      d by the Ministry of External Affairs. It also arranged various 
      functions concer ning the visits to India of foreign Heads of 
      State/Government. The Cell shared its expertise with other 
      Departments of the Government in the successful organizati on of 
      their conferences. The available equipments was loaned, free of cost, to 
      va rious Government organizations from time to time. All these 
      measures resulted in considerable savings in expenditure to the 
      Government, both in Indian Rupees and foreign exchange. An 
      illustrative list of conferences/functions organised during the 
      year is given in Appendix XV <br><br><p></p></td></tr>

      CHAPTER XVII 
      <br>FOREIGN SERVICE TRAINING INSTITUTE <br><br>DURING the period under 
      review, the training activities of the Foreign Ser vice Training 
      Institute (FSTI) increased manifold in range, scale and scope. The 
      FSTI was placed under the full time charge of a Dean in the rank of 
      Secreta ry to Government of India. (Shri A.N.D. Haksar, a Grade I 
      IFS Officer, took charge as Dean in March 1988). Two IFS Officers of 
      Grade IV joined the FSTI Faculty against two newly created posts. The 
      FSTI staff position also improved following the joining of one 
      Accounts Officer (SAS), two Accounts- knowing Assistants and three 
      LDCs against newly created posts. Joint Secretary (FSTI) was delegated 
      the financial powers of a Head of Department in order to facilitate 
      the functioning of the FSTI as a training institution. <br><br>The 
      first-ever meeting of the FSTI Advisory Committee under the 
      Chairmanship of the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri K. 
      Natwar Singh, took place on Aug 16, 1988. Others who participated in 
      this meeting were Foreign Secretary, Special Envoy to Prime Minister, 
      Dean of FSTI, Special Secretary (Administration) and Additional 
      Secretary (Financial Adviser). The Committee reviewed the 
      functioning of the FSTI, and approved various measures to enhance 
      the efficacy of the FSTI as a training institution. <br><br>Several new 
      courses (Orientation Programme for Spouses, Course on Crisis 
      Management, Refresher Course for Commercial Representatives in 
      Missions abroad, Special Programme for RITES officials, Orientation 
      Course on Computers for Database Management, Orientation Programme 
      for State Government Protocol Officials, Course for Group D Officials, 
      Course on Telephone Techniques, etc.) were introduced this year. 
      Details of these course s are included in Appendix XVI. 
      <br>PG102<br>PG103<br>Under instructions from the Minister for 
      External Affairs the duration of the course for IFS Probationers (1987 
      batch) was extended by three months and new Modules on Intelligence, 
      Crisis Management, Conference handling, etc. were introduced apart 
      from lengthening the module on Indian Culture and Cultural Diplomacy. 
      Details of the courses of the IFS Probationers (both 1987 and 1988 
      batches) are given in Appendix XVI. <br><br>During 1988-89, the FSTI 
      conducted eight Basic Professional, Courses for about 400 Section 
      Officers, Assistants, Upper Division Clerks and Lower Division Clerks 
      who were/are proceeding on transfer to Indian Missions abroad. The 
      BPC covered modules on Computers, Administration, Accounts, Consular 
      and General Areas (Diplomacy/Information/Commerce). The Minister for 
      External Affairs presided over the Certificates-Presentation-Ceremony 
      to the successful participants of XIIIth BPC Course. In addition to 
      BPC, special workshops/seminars on Administration, Finance and 
      Accounts were also conducted (Appendix XVI). As a part of 
      mid-career training programme, the FSTI organised a course for 
      Commercial Representatives serving abroad in February 1989. In accordance 
      with the decision of the FSTI Advisory Committee, a proposal for a 
      high-level Refresher Course for Heads of Mission has been 
      formulated and submitted for the Committee's consideration. 
      The FSTI geared up its activities to meet requests for providing 
      appropria te orientation to officials from other Government of 
      India Departments/Ministries being posted abroad, and also for 
      training of officials from other countries. <br><br>During 1988, several 
      Military Attache-designates from Ministry of Defence and officials 
      from Ministries of Tourism/Information/Commerce attended selected 
      modules from the course for 1987 IFS Probationers. During 1989 
      (January-March), two Diplomatic Officers from Mauritius and officials 
      from Ministry of Defence/Ministry of Tourism will attend training 
      modules from the course meant for 1988 batch IFS Probationers. 
      Consequent on the above mentioned courses, the total number of 
      trainees who availed all FSTI courses in 1988-89 was 612 compared to 
      289 in 1987-88 and 122 in 1986-87. The FSTI enlarged its 
      cooperating contacts with other training institutes (LBSNAA, IIFT, 
      ASCI, MDI, IIPA and NDC) in India and initiated contacts with similar 
      organizations (ADDAIIR, EROPA) abroad. It also developed 
      <br>PG104<br>relations with multilateral training institutions like 
      UNITAR, UNDTCD and ITC (CATT/UNCTAD). As a result of this increasing 
      cooperation with other organizations, a number of visits took place in 
      1988-89; details of such visits are given in Appendix XVI. 
      FSTI is in the process of establishing a documentation centre. It 
      has commenced a publication programme and already brought out one 
      brochure and two booklets on work in Missions abroad. A written 
      symposium on the Role of the Junior Diplomat in Missions abroad, and 
      another on Commercial representation are under preparation.

      <br><br>CHAPTER XVIII <br><br>USE OF HINDI IN OFFICIAL WORK USE of 
      Hindi in this Ministry has two aspects-Implementation of the Offici al 
      Language Policy of the Government and Propagation of Hindi in foreign 
      countries. The Ministry has three Committees namely, Hindi 
      Advisory Committee, Official Language Implementation Committee and a 
      sub-committee of the Hindi Advisory Committee, working under 
      chairmanship of the Minister for External Affairs, Secretary (10) and 
      JS(AD) respectively. During the year under review meetings of 
      these committees were held and efforts were made to implement their 
      suggestions. <br><br>Several sections in the Ministry and Regional 
      Passport Offices at Hyderabad, Madras and Calcutta were inspected and 
      remedial instructions issued. Besides, an incentive scheme 
      carrying cash prizes for officials and staff who d o their entire 
      official work or a part thereof in Hindi, has been introduced. To 
      encourage Regional Passport Offices to do their work in Hindi, a 
      competitive scheme has been introduced with the winning office 
      receiving a shield. A kit o f Hindi aid material was distributed 
      in the sections and to the Regional Passport Offices. In addition 
      a Hindi Week was organised in the Ministry in December 1988. 
      The Ministry continued its efforts to propagate Hindi abroad. Sets 
      of Hindi books on various facets of India, Hindi Text Books, 
      Children's Literature , Devanagari Typing Machines, Hindi 
      Linguaphone Cassettes and Records, Hindi alphabet charts, standard 
      Hindi-English and English-Hindi Dictionaries were sent to the Indian 
      Missions abroad for helping them to build standard Hindi Libraries or 
      for donation/presentation to deserving Governmental or voluntary 
      institutions/organizations engaged in propagation of Hindi abroad. 
      The Hindi Teaching Scheme for children in Missions abroad 
      continued satisfactorily and some new classes were added. 
      <br>PG105<br>PG106<br>In order to encourage foreign students to 
      learn Hindi in their countries, our Mission in Jakarta instituted 
      an award for the best Hindi student in the Gandhi Memorial 
      International School, Jakarta and our Mission in Seoul organised a 
      Hindi Speech contest in Pusan University of Foreign Studies, Pusan. 
      As in previous years, this year also, the OSD (Hindi) was sent 
      to the PMI, New York to assist the Indian delegation to the United 
      Nations General Assembly wishing to speak in Hindi in UNGA. The 
      Minister for External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao addressed the 
      UN General Assembly in Hindi and one member of the Indian delegation 
      spoke in Hindi in one of the Committees of the United Nations.
