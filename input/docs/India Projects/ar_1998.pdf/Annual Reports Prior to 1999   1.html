Conclusion Africa is in a phase of transition, leaving behind the legacies of the past, and moving towards a many-splendoured future embracing democracy, economic reform and a constructive emergence of regional identities. India, with its unique developmental experience, and as the world's largest democracy undergoing significant economic reform, has a vital role to play in underpinning and moulding such an African future. The people of Indian origin who have made Africa their home in almost every corner of the continent are a natural bridge in re-enforcing our future ties with Africa. However, India's diplomatic vision extends beyond such natural ethnic affinities to embrace the interests of Africa as a whole, particularly in the priority area of economic progress and development. Such an economic congruence is facilitated by a broad agreement between India and the countries of Africa on their vision of a new world order characterised by peace, justice and equity, and fully responsive to the needs and interests of the developing world. uu<br><br>MAURITIUS NAMIBIA SOUTH AFRICA USA INDIA KENYA MALI UGANDA RWANDA ETHIOPIA SEYCHELLES CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MADAGASCAR TANZANIA CONGO ZIMBABWE ZAMBIA BOTSWANA NIGER NIGERIA SENEGAL BURKINA FASO COTE D'IVOIRE</p>undertakeeffective investment promotionlocated in London.

The Principal Secretary to PM visited UK on 4 &amp; 5 June, 1998, as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister and on 20 &amp; 21 January, 1991. The visit of Mr Derek Fatchett, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth to India in November 1998 was also beneficial. The External Affairs Minister visited UK from 2-7 February, 1999. During this visit, discussions were held on a wide range of issues, including, inter alia, bilateral cooperation, regional developments, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. These have proved to be useful in promoting greater mutual understanding.<br><br>Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth Secretary General (CSG), visited India from 13-18 February, 1999. The visit was part of the traditional round of consultations that the CSG undertakes with member countries before a Cornmonwealth Heads of Governments Meeting, the next one being held in South Africa in November 1999. During the visit, the CSG called on the President, the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. The CSG's visit to India coincided with the Asia Trade and Investment Forum organised by the Commonwealth Business Council and the Confederation of Indian Industry, from 14-16 February, 1999.<br><br>Developments with far reaching impact are presently taking place at the EU level. The finalisation of the Economic and Monetary Union with the adoption of a single currency Euro by 11 member states of the EU from January 1999 has significance for the international financial system as also implications for the attempts to forge a "European identity" in international affairs. The EU is working on plans for an eastward expansion and there is a serious discussion on the need for its internal financial reforms. There have been moves towards initiating a discussion on NATO's nuclear doctrine and the scope and mandate of its activities, even as it prepares to accept three new members from 1999, its 50th anniversary year. The forthcoming NATO Summit to be held in Washington in April 1999 is expected to consider a New Strategic Concept for the organization which may go beyond the defence of the territories of member countries. These developments impact on the evolving security architecture in Europe and have implications for the security around that region.<br><br>The EU, with its fifteen member countries is the largest economic entity in the world today. It is India's largest trade partner with an annual bilateral trade of over US $ 21 billion in 1997. It is also India's second largest source of approved foreign investment (over Rs 300 billion during 1991-August 1998) and an important partner in technology cooperation.<br><br>The 11th Round of annual India-EU Ministerial level talks was held in New Delhi on 13 November, 1998. MOS (EA) led the Indian delegation at the talks.

These were led by Dr (Mrs) Benita Ferrero-Waldner, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Austria, Mr Manuel Marin, Vice President of the EC, Mr Guenther Verheugen, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Germany and Mr Derek Fatchett, Minister of State, FCO, UK respectively. The discussion covered India- EU relations, new initiatives in this regard, regional developments, disarmament and non-proliferation, reform of the UN, international terrorism and other subjects of mutual interest. The first India-EU Senior Officials Meeting had earlier been held in London on 21 April, 1998. The first meeting of officials of the two sides dealing with Policy Planning was held in April 1998 in New Delhi. uu<br><br>RUSSIA INDIA USA PHILIPPINES UNITED KINGDOM ARMENIA GEORGIA UKRAINE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES(CIS) BELORUSSIA ESTONIA LATVIA BULGARIA CROATIA CZECH REPUBLIC HUNGARY POLAND OMAN ROMANIA SLOVAKIA SLOVENIA GERMANY PORTUGAL FRANCE SWITZERLAND BELGIUM THE NETHERLANDS DENMARK NORWAY SWEDEN AUSTRIA CYPRUS GREECE ITALY FINLAND IRELAND ICELAND SPAIN<br><br>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report<br><br>1998<br>8<br><br>The Americas<br>USA<br>Relations with the United States during the year can be seen broadly in two phases. In the early part of the year, there was continuation of a broad based dialogue which both countries had agreed upon. In that context, US Permanent Representative to UN, Bill Richardson headed a delegation to India from April 14-15, 1998. The Indian and the US side had useful exchanges of views on a number of important international, bilateral and regional issues.<br><br>Following India's nuclear tests, the US reaction was extremely critical and negative. The reaction was made up of several elements including what the United States saw as a challenge to the non-proliferation regime which the United States and other nuclear-weapon states have south to put in place to preserve their monopoly of nuclear weapons. It also contained elements of frustration at US inability to detect the tests in advance. India look every opportunity to respond to such statements wherever necessary.<br><br>The US also took the initiativein meetings of the P-5 and G-8 to orchestrate condemnation of the nuclear tests. Many of these countries, however, did not go along with attempts to multilateralise the imposition of restrictive economic measures against India.<br><br>Since then, the reaction has toned down and, to some extent, moderated, This has been reflected in more balanced coverage in the US media. There have been a number of articles and statements from eminent US political personalities and strategic analysts which reflect a better understanding of India's security concerns. There has also been considerable debate in the United States regarding the effectiveness of the coercive economic measures called "sanctions".<br><br>Despite development of the strains in the bilateral relationship, the visits of prominent US political representative continued. US Senators Sam Brownback and Charles Robb, visited India from June 26-30. On their return to the US, these Senators introduced an Amendment to provide authority to the President to waive for up to one year some of the economic measures under Glenn Amendment. In July 1998, US Congress passed an amendment which was called "Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998" which exempted finance and credit guarantees for agricultural commodities, medicine and fertilisers from the purview of 1994.<br><br>After the nuclear tests and the apprehensions expressed in several countries, it was decided to have a more intensive dialogue with the United States. Shri Jaswant Singh, then Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission and Mr Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State have been designated as Representatives to conduct this dialogue.<br><br>The talks are being conducted on the basis of the comprehensive proposals that India has put forward on disarmament and non-proliferation matters, our unilateral moratorium on explosive nuclear tests, willingness to discuss converting this moratorium into a de jure obligation, our offer to enter into constructive negotiations on the FMCT and reaffirming our policies on stringent control on export of sensitive technologies.<br><br>The talks have focussed on issues related to disarmament and non-proliferation. Both sides have agreed that these issues should be kept distinct from regional issues. After six rounds of discussions the talks have narrowed down four issues. These are the CTBT, the FMCT, Export Controls and Defence Posture. On Export Control Issues an expert level meeting was also held in New Delhi on 9-10 November, 1998. The meeting was deemed helpful by both India and the US to the prospects of continuing cooperation in this area. Both sides have agreed to meet in 2nd half of January 1999 in New Delhi to carry forward this dialogue.<br><br>The US has recently announced a partial lifting of the restrictive measures imposed against India. These relate to EXIM, OPIC, TDA Financing and Military Training. The US has stated that these measures are being lifted in recognition of the progress made in the bilateral dialogue. It is however noted that non- basic human needs financing from multilateral financial institutions is still subject to US restrictions. India regards these coercive and restrictive measures as unjustified and counter-productive which should be lifted.<br><br>The US has also issued a list of Indian Government Organisations, Research Institutions, PSUs and Private Companies, which will be subject to export restrictions. This step is with clearly punitive intent. India has made it clear to the US that such measures will be regarded as adverse developments in our relations and will not be conducive to the ongoing dialogue. These aspects were reiterated strongly at the last round of discussions held on 19-20 November, 1998. So far there has been no change in the US position. India will continue to take up this matter in bilateral discussions and is also examining the feasibility of multilateral options, such as consistency with WTO provisions. US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott visited India from January 29 to February 1, 1999 with an 8-member delegation including the Vice-Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Ralston for the 8th round of Indo-US talks. Discussions between the Indian and US delegations were held on January 29, 30 and 31. The Indian side was led by Shri Jaswant Singh, External Affairs Minister.<br><br>During the talks, the security perspectives of the two sides were further elaborated and clarified and proposals for harmonising these perspectives were explored. Both delegations were satisfied with the outcome of these talks and believed that progress was made in some of the subjects under discussions. Both sides are determined to create a positive atmosphere for advancing the bilateral relations. Indian and US expert level teams will meet in March for follow-up talks on export controls. The two sides have agreed to remain in close contact.<br><br>The next round of the dialogue is envisioned towards the middle of the year, the dates and the venue of the same would be determined in consultations between the two sides.<br><br>Canada The Governor General of Canada, Romeo LeBlanc and Mrs LeBlanc, accompanied by Canadian Revenue Minister, Herb Dhaliwal, paid a State visit to India from March 26 to April 1, 1998. It was the first ever visit by a Governor General of Canada to India specifically undertaken in the context of the 50th Anniversary celebrations of India's independence.<br><br>Canada reacted very adversely to India's nuclear tests in May 1998, and unilaterally restricted government contact. The Canadian position contained a number of elements which were totally unacceptable to India. Canada also placed restrictions on assistance under CIDA. Subsequently, Canada informed that all ongoing projects would continue to receive funding and that new projects of a basic needs nature could be taken up.<br><br>The Canadian Leader of the Opposition, Mr Preston Manning visited India in July- August, 1998. He observed that although Canada did not agree with India's nuclear tests, that was no reason for lack of dialogue, and that India and Canada should be able to talk over differences as friends. There is little change in the official Canadian position so far. Government of India will conduct its relations with Canada in a reciprocal basis. Finance Minister visited Canada in September 1998, for the Commonwealth Finance Minister's meeting.<br><br>Trade between India and Canada continued to flourish. Last year, Indian exports to Canada registered an increase of nearly 23% . This year, during the period January-July, the Indian exports have reached C$ 536.569 from 424.532 during the same period last year marking a growth of 26.38%. On the other hand, Indian imports from Canada during this period have declined to C$ 182.614 from 287.695 showing a decrease of 36.52%.<br><br>Mr Jonathan T Fried, Assistant Deputy Minister for Trade and Economic Policy of Canada visited India from January 25-27, 1999.

Presently India maintains 13 Resident Missions and 1 post in the region. India's interaction and collaboration with these countries is close both in the bilateral context and in multilateral fora. 11 countries from the region maintain Resident Diplomatic Missions in New Delhi, Uruguay being the latest to open their Mission in November 1998. Guyana is also considering opening of a Resident Mission in New Delhi.<br><br>Interaction with the countries of the region is conducted through bilateral consultative mechanisms. Presently we have such agreements with 9 countries. High level visits complemented by bilateral and official visits have further cemented our relations with the region. In the economic field, realising the potential of the region a concerted effort has been made to diversify and enhance bilateral cooperation. Similar economic reforms in most of the countries in the region have facilitated mutually beneficial cooperation. There have been an increased number of visits of official and private business delegations to and from the region. India has trade and economic agreements with 7 countries of the region and set up Joint Business Councils with some other countries. In continuation of the FOCUS LAC Programme, exclusive Indian exhibitions have helped the dissemination of information on the opportunities available for mutual beneficial economic interaction. Due to concerted efforts trade between India and the LAC region in 1997-98 has grown to over US $ 1.3 billion.<br><br>In the field of culture India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region. Some of the countries like Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad &amp; Tobago have a substantial percentage of people of Indian origin. The region also has also more than 500 institutions, schools, libraries and streets named after Indian leaders. At the institutional level there are cultural agreements and Cultural Exchange Programmes with governments that provide the framework for meaningful interactions between artistes, academicians and scholars. In addition, India gives technical assistance under the ITEC programme to several countries of the region.<br><br>India also has been able to establish institutional relations with the regional organisations like the Organisation of American States (OAS), Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and the Andean Community where we have Observer Status. India participated in the meetings of the regional organisations in our capacity as Observers. A mechanism for dialogue with the Rio Group and MERCOSUR has also been established.<br><br>After the nuclear tests on 11 &amp; 13 May, 1998, Brazil cancelled the Agreement with India on Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy.

Whereas the global economy had recorded a modest growth of 3% per annum during the period 1994-97, it became widely apparent in 1998 that world economy may be hurtling towards economic contraction and a phase of intense instability. The recent but persistent financial crisis, which first hit East and South East Asia in 1997 and later showed its contagion effect in Russia, Latin America and even US and Europe, had shaken the world out of complacency. Recessionary trends in Japan further compounded the depressing economic and business scenario prevailing in the world today. As the recession spread, the investors shied away from the emerging economies. Even relatively insulated economies such as India and China felt its adverse impact. These events only proved how the economies all over the globe had become inter-linked in an era of globalisation.<br><br>The direct impact of these developments on India had been somewhat limited last year. However, since the beginning of 1998, it became apparent that the crisis in these regions had been more deep-rooted than expected. Following four years of impressive performance, India's industrial and export growth started turning sluggish since 1997-98. Notwithstanding the increasing strains and dampening effect on India's external trade sector, macro-economic fundamentals of Indian economy remained strong. Against this setting, ensuring India's economic security and maintaining the momentum gained in Indian export expansion, FDI and FII inflows, technology transfers and that the confidence in the Indian economy was not eroded, was the major challenge confronting the economic diplomacy of India.<br><br>A key role that the Economic Division has been entrusted with and which it has been playing vigorously is the promotion of India's economic and commercial interests. The Economic Division interacted intensively with various Ministries, apex chambers of commerce and industry, business organisations, trade promotion councils &amp; agencies and the business community to evolve strategies and contribute to promotion of trade and investment. The Division was associated with a number of economic policy making bodies, both inter-ministerial and public sector undertaking and industry associations. In particular, Economic Division represented MEA on the boards of EXIM Bank, Indian Trade Promotion Organisation, Empowered Committee of Oil and Natural Gas Commission-Videsh Limited, Special Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on Indian Investments Abroad, RITES, WAPCOS, Overseas Construction Council of India, National Centre for Trade Information, etc. This enabled the Ministry to provide not only the political inputs and MEA's thinking on various subjects but also the regional and global perspectives on various policy issues which have a bearing on the economic interests of India. Having been closely associated with the policy making aspects of trade reforms and liberalisations, streamlining of procedures for promotion of Indian exports and Indian investments overseas, analytical inputs were provided to the nodal ministeries.<br><br>Another key role that the Economic Division undertook was to provide a standard backstopping arrangements and a nodal point for addressing the concerns of Indian exporters and industry by providing and seeking timely inputs to and from our Missions. Keeping in view the crucial importance of information dissemination and providing value added information, the Economic Division continued to provide a backup support and information wherewithal to our Missions abroad to enable them to carry out their economic and commercial functions effectively. The Economic Division continued to update its information base on the Indian economy, evolution of trade, economic and investment policies, database of Indian exporters, opportunities for Indian exporters abroad and technology-related aspects by liaising with concerned Government departments and trade information networks in India. Thus the Division could respond effectively and in a timely manner to various economic and commercial queries from the exporters and our Missions abroad. The Indian Missions were also advised from time to time to upgrade their databases and establish connectivity to online databases, develop promotional strategies and undertake large scale information dissemination campaigns regularly so that India's economic policies and concomitant opportunities reached out to the largest cross-section of the local investors and business community. Missions were continuously urged to improve upon their lead response time in addressing the concerns and interests of Indian business and exporting community. While impressing on the Missions to accord highest priority to economic and commercial work, greater emphasis was placed on effectively projecting India's image and building up a global India Brand Equity as a competitive economy as well as in a number of niche products, both traditional and non-traditional including financial services and Information Technology sectors so that a major export thrust could be achieved.<br><br>Being the export-promotion cell of the Ministry, the Economic Division interacted and rendered inputs and assistance in trade promotion efforts of Government agencies and industry associations in order to evolve a pragmatic approach towards our export promotion efforts and further improvements in our trade promotion strategies. The Division assisted in the efforts of various organisations in promoting the participation of foreign business organisations in Indian trade fairs and Indian business in foreign trade fairs, sector- specific seminars, road shows, buyer-seller meets etc. The Division also provided assistance in facilitating contacts between Indian businessmen and their counterparts in major target countries and where required in match making and joint ventures, penetrating new markets, marketing and trade promotion activities etc. Economic Division was actively associated with the "Made in India" show in South Africa and FICCI/CII exhibition in Oman, which were specifically aimed at showcasing India's achievements, strengths and potential and promoting Indian brand image abroad. The Division facilitated through contact with foreign Missions in India and Indian Missions abroad and in collaboration with apex chambers the visits of business delegations to and from India. The Indian industry and business community was increasingly associated in various events of G-15, IOR-ARC, BIMST-EC so that eventually there are trade and investment spin offs for India. The Division circulated wide range of useful information from time to time to apex business chambers and our missions abroad. The Division also received a number of trade complaints both from Indian and foreign companies which were promptly attended to in consultation with our Missions and concerned agencies including DGFT.<br><br>The Economic Division was involved in processing more than 150 proposals for setting up joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries relating to Indian investments overseas involving over US$ 250 million. Similarly the information on foreign investment regulation from various countries were procured and analysed in order to advise other concerned ministries on the viability of incorporating relevant and competitive aspects in our own policies. Another important work of the Economic Division was its increasing and active involvement in work relating WTO. The Division provided inputs on a large number of trade related subjects to influence and purse the issues of interest to India. The Economic Division was actively associated in providing inputs and international perspective as well as political economic assessments in deliberations of various joint business councils and joint commission/committees.<br><br>The Economic Division has been actively contributing to crisis management as well as damage containment and damage prevention on a number of market access and trade related problems and issues affecting India's exports and imports. Emerging patterns with regard to regional groupings, free trade areas, trade blocs, market access related issues and use of restrictive and protectionist policies by various countries which have an impact on the Indian exports were monitored closely and strategies devised to best cope with non-tariff and technical barriers of various kinds. For instance EU has emerged as the largest user of trade protection instruments during the last 2-3 years on imports from India. In particular Indian textiles, steel products, engineering goods and pharmaceuticals have been subjected to around 25 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. Some of the items like unbleached cotton fabric, bed-linen, synthetic fiber ropes had been repeatedly targeted. The defence of such actions called for elaborate steps and extensive lobbying efforts.<br><br>The Economic Division actively participated in coordinating efforts of the concerned Ministries, Export Promotion Councils, Trade Associations, Indian Missions abroad to take up the issues at appropriate fora to safeguard the interests of Indian industry. As a result of this coordinated action, EU's anti-dumping case on imports of unbleached cotton fabric from India ended satisfactorily without imposition of any definitive duties. Economic Division was also actively involved in monitoring and analysing the impact of economic sanctions imposed by certain countries after the nuclear tests by India. With regard to child labour issue which is increasingly being used for protectionist purposes, the Economic Division continued in its efforts to project the problem in its right perspective and to dispel the misconceptions and skewed impressions propagated by various vested interests in our major export markets. In another case involving grant of patent by US Patent and Trade Mark Office to an American company on basmati rice, the Economic Division actively participated in an inter-organisational exercise to prevent misappropriation of indigenous biogenetic resources of India by other countries.<br><br>Apart from the economic and trade-related activities, the Economic Division also processed the Government of India's nominations for various courses and training programmes offered by Singapore under the Colombo Plan and Thailand and Indonesia under the Technical and Cooperation among Developing Countries. Multilateral Economic Relations Introduction The world found itself in a difficult and uncertain economic environment during the year. What had started off as a liquidity crisis in Thailand in mid-1997 snowballed in 1998 into a loss of investor confidence in emerging markets as a whole, and more specifically in the ASEAN countries, South Korea and in Russia. One country after another experienced a sharp downturn in its stock market and a depreciation of its currency owing to a decline of confidence in the viability of its banks and financial institutions. The vast foreign capital that had made possible the Asian miracle of the 80's and early 90's, began to drain out rapidly.<br><br>Although largely protected from similar capital outflows, the Indian economy suffered on account of declining demand for its goods and services in South-East and East Asia, Russia and in recession-struck Japan. But despite the uncertain market conditions, Indian exports sustained their growth in the US and other select developed markets, and that in the face of increasingly competition. India's resilience gives us the confidence that Indian industry will be well- positioned to take advantage of the global recovery when it begins. Today, governments are being called upon to have a more active economic agenda. The World Development Report of 1997 says that development requires an effective State, one that plays a catalytic, facilitating role, encouraging and complementing the activities of private. Businesses and individuals. The reform agenda is hence not just one of liberalisation and a greater reliance on market forces. It is as importantly a redefinition of the government's economic role and responsibilities. Driven by globalisation, rapid diffusion of new technologies, and multilateral harmonisation of international economic activity, there are changes continuously taking place in global trade and investment, with both government and business having to respond.<br><br>The Ministry has accordingly made use of its vantage position by its outreach with economic agencies both within and outside the country, and thus has been a conduit for the flow of information. Our work with economic ministries and state governments as well with trade and industry associations helped our embassies abroad to project the range of opportunities for foreign investors in India. We have tried to play the role of an informed and committed intermediary helping to interpret the expectations that India and the outside world have of each other. Our effort has been to interpret change, identify opportunities and anticipate challenges for our industries and companies. Our objective has been to balance the country's self interest with obligations deriving from our participation in the larger international economic community. Our work, therefore, has been an integral part of India's collective endeavour for commercial and economic development and for a greater Indian presence in the world markets.<br><br>Multilateral Economic Relations Division In the light of these parameters, Multilateral Economic Relations (MER) Division has pursued promotion of India's relations with international multilateral economic organisations and regional, sub-regional and supra-regional economic and trade groupings. Given the emerging importance of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Ministry was actively involved in trade policy-making in GOI and in negotiations on various trade issues. WTO issues are an integral and intrinsic part of international relations and impact on our overall economic and political relations with other WTO member countries. Accordingly, important multilateral developments which have a bearing on global trade and commerce, are regularly analysed and monitored. Inputs on various trade policy issues like Investment, Competition Policy, Government Procurement, Intellectual Property Rights, etc. are duly conveyed to concerned GOI Ministries from time to time. Besides theoretical analysis, MEA was also represented at important events like the Second WTO Ministerial Conference at Geneva to ensure that it keeps abreast of the nuances involved in the WTO multilateral negotiations.<br><br>India's Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN saw many positive developments this year. The Second Meeting of the ASEAN-India Joint Cooperation Committee (AIJCC) was held at Singapore on April 28-29, 1998. India reaffirmed its solidarity with ASEAN in the wake of the financial crisis plaguing the region. Measures outlined by India in this context included Government-to-Government Credit, Exim Bank credit for trade finance, facilities for counter trade, EXIM Bank credit finance for outward and inward investment to and from South-East Asia, feasibility study and consultancy financing by EXIM Bank for infrastructure projects, guarantees and counter guarantees for trade finance, and enhancement of Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programmes for ASEAN countries.<br><br>As part of the on-going India-ASEAN Cooperation in academic and People-to-People Contacts, the India-ASEAN Lecture Series was initiated in December 1996. As many as five lectures by eminent persons from ASEAN countries were organised between May and August 1998. These included Dr Thaksin Shinawatra, former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Executive Editor of "The Nation" (Bangkok), Dr J Soedradjad Djiwandono, former Governor of Central Bank of Indonesia, and Prof Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore. From the Indian side, eminent Space scientist Prof U R Rao delivered lectures in Malaysia and Dr R A Mashelkar, Director General of CSIR in Thailand.<br><br>A large contingent of scientists was deputed to participate in the Fifth ASEAN Science and Technology Week (FASTW) and Exhibition held at Hanoi, Vietnam from October 12-15, 1998. Besides taking part in the deliberations, the scientists made focussed presentations on the scientific and technological strides made by India. India also put up a stall at the Exhibition where its strengths in Information Technology, Remote Sensing, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and India's vision 2020 were highlighted.<br><br>An India-ASEAN Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Partenariat was organised by FICCI from November 10-11, 1998. The Partenariat was designed to facilitate business linkages amongst Indian and ASEAN SMEs by providing them an opportunity to interact closely and to apprise themselves of mutual strengths and complementarities. In all, 27 SME companies from ASEAN and nearly 200 representatives from Indian companies, participated in this event.<br><br>The nascent regional grouping called Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIMST-EC), launched in June, 1997, registered commendable progress. India participated in the BIMST-EC Working Group meetings, to give shape to emerging initiatives for cooperation. The BIMST-EC Economic Ministers' Retreat held on 7 August 1998 at Bangkok. decided that lead countries would coordinate cooperation in the six priority sectors, viz., Trade and Investment (Bangladesh), Technology (India), Transport and Communications (Thailand), Energy (Myanmar), Tourism (Sri Lanka), and Fisheries (Sri Lanka).<br><br>With the Ministry's support and in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism, the Confederation of Indian Industry organised a BIMST-EC Tourism Summit at Calcutta from October 30-31, 1998 which was attended by the Tourism Ministers, senior Tourism Officials and travel trade representatives from BIMST-EC countries. It adopted an Action Plan identifying short, medium and long term measures and policies covering areas such as infrastructure corridors, facilitation and promotion measures, declaration of the Year 2001 as 'Visit BIMST-EC Year', Buddhist Circuit and technical training.<br><br>India also participated in the Second BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting held at Dhaka from December 17-19, 1998. The meeting emphasised the need to take practical initiatives to implement projects in agreed sectors of cooperation. It recommended establishment of multimodal transport linkages, regional cooperation in the energy sector, promotion of tourism and active participation by the private sector for intensifying existing linkages between members. The meeting approved admission of Nepal as an Observer besides evolving general guidelines for admission of new observers and guests. It also outlined future priorities including South-South cooperation, trade facilitation and development of a free trade arrangement enhancing regional complementarities and taking initiatives for making the international economic and trading system more favourable for developing countries.<br><br>As in the past, India adopted an active profile in the context of 'Group of 15'(G-15) activities during the year. It participated in the Eighth G-15 Summit held at Cairo from May 11-13, 1998. The high-level Indian delegation to the Summit was led by the Hon'ble Vice-President. The Summit focussed on two major themes, viz., developments in international financial markets; and developments in the Multilateral Trading System and enhancement of intra-G-15 Cooperation in trade and investment. The Summit examined different perspectives and called for comprehensive and urgent action on preventing the spread of the financial turmoil in East and South East Asia. On the issue of the multilateral trading system, the Summit focussed on evolving common (developing) country positions on various matters to be taken up at the Second WTO Ministerial Conference at Geneva in May 1998, as well as on facilitating a positive agenda for developing countries.<br><br>Apart from providing an Indian perspective to the two main themes of the Summit, the Indian delegation also played a major role in focussing Summit discussions on issues like terrorism and bio-diversity. On WTO issues, India emphasized that the pursuit of liberalisation which has become WTO's raison d'etre, was not an end in itself and should meet the core objectives of rapid development, welfare gains and best returns for the extant and potential resources of developing countries. Towards this end, India submitted proposals outlining developing countries' concerns and possible ways of ensuring special and differential treatment to developing countries in all aspects of the WTO agenda and its implementation.<br><br>An MOU on Small Scale Industries Cooperation was concluded between India and Egypt under the framework of the SSI Cooperation Project. The business cooperation pursued in parallel with the Summit included the setting up of a G- 15 Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. A composite Indian business delegation from the apex Chambers participated in the business workshop. India also exhibited a cross-section of its products under the theme "Modern India" at the G-15 Business Exhibition.<br><br>In pursuance of its commitment at the Cairo Summit, India hosted a G-15 Symposium on 'Special and Differential Provisions for Developing and Least Developed Countries in the Uruguay Round Agreements' in New Delhi from November 10-11, 1998. The Symposium reiterated that the commitments made in the Uruguay Round Agreements must be fulfilled. The deliberations revealed that there was a common approach with regard to strengthening of certain concessions inherent in the WTO Agreement in the areas of longer transition periods, larger threshold limits, reorientation of 'best endeavour' clauses, linking of S&amp;D treatment to development parameters, improvement of market access for developing countries through S&amp;D provisions, transfer of technology, technical assistance and cooperation.<br><br>India also participated in the Ninth G-15 Summit held at Montego Bay, Jamaica from 10-12 February 1999. Hon'ble Prime Minister led the Indian delegation to the Summit. The G-15 Summit Meetings deliberated extensively on issues of concern to developing countries. These included discussions on the current international economic situation including the need for an international consultative process in respect of capital flows, reaffirmation of the importance of a transparent, fair and equitable rules-based multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organisation, reform of the international financial architecture, South-South and intra G-15 cooperation and prospects of undertaking a G-15 - G-8 dialogue in these matters.<br><br>All such priorities were duly reflected in the Joint Communique issued at the end of the Ninth Summit. In order to be able to cope with challenges posed by globalisation and economic liberalisation and the ongoing financial crisis, members agreed to promote convergence of viewpoints on these issues. They also called for enhanced regional and international cooperation to combat the menace of terrorism. India's offer to host a G-15 meeting at an appropriate level in preparation for the Third WTO International Conference was welcomed by the participants at the Ninth G-15 Summit. They also endorsed India's proposal which suggested adoption of a strategic sectors approach towards South-South cooperation focussing on core areas like bio-technology, information technology and infrastructure development.<br><br>India also took active interest in the programmes of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). It participated in a major Indian Ocean Rim Trade Exhibition organised in Oman (Muscat) from October 10-14, 1998. India also participated in the First Meeting of Experts on Standards &amp; Accreditation from November 9-11, 1998 in Colombo. A high-level delegation was deputed to participate in the First IOR-ARC Senior Trade Policy Officials Meeting held at Perth ( Australia) from December 7-8, 1998. The Second Ministerial Meeting of IOR-ARC is scheduled to take place in Maputo (Mozambique) in March 1999. A high-level Indian delegation is expected to participate in the meeting. A Seminar on Trade and Investment in IOR-ARC countries, which will be coordinated by the IOR-ARC Chair in the University of Mauritius, is planned to be held alongside the meeting.<br><br>India is an active member of the 'Group of 77' and participated in the Annual Ministerial Meeting held at New York on 25 September, 1998 which was held against the backdrop of a global financial crisis and prospects of an economic recession. India has taken initiatives on (a) sensitisation and consciousness raising on the gravity of problems and on the systemic crises that need to be highlighted besides highlighting opportunities presented by the situation for developing countries (b) getting developing countries to focus on key issues that they need to stress and negotiate with the developed countries in the financial, monetary and trading system, (c) drawing attention of the North to the key concept of international public good rather than just market forces being an important determinant of international economic policy and order, (d) bringing back the focus on concessional financial flows, more favourable and relatively unhindered transfer of technology and special and differential treatment in trade to developing countries as part of development cooperation agenda, and (e) establishing synergy and connectivity between this agenda and the new liberalisation and globalisation agenda.<br><br>As a symbol of its solidarity with Africa, India participated in the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-II) which was held in Tokyo from October 19-21, 1998. About 80 countries and 40 international organisations and the UN Secretary General, participated in the event at which the developmental concerns and priorities of African countries received attention. The need to step up the level of developmental assistance and cooperation with African countries was duly recognised by developed countries.<br><br>India's intervention highlighted its special relationship with Africa and commitment to deeper economic cooperation as well as ongoing technical assistance projects in Africa. It recommended adoption of triangular cooperation involving developed countries or international organisations along with the technical expertise of a developing country for projects in Africa. In keeping with its commitment at the South-South Conference on Trade, Finance and Investment held in San Jose (Costa Rica) in January 1997, India hosted a "G- 77 Trade Fair and Trade Conference" in New Delhi in November 1998. The objective was to enhance South-South Cooperation by providing an opportunity for developing business contacts and networking amongst the G-77 countries, and also to create greater awareness for enhancing business opportunities by utilising the vast trade, economic and business potential existing in the South. A New Delhi Declaration setting the agenda for Trade and Investment cooperation for G- 77 was adopted.<br><br>With the developed world's think-tank and policy consultation body, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), India continued to develop a policy dialogue relationship. It participated in OECD's outreach programmes for Dynamic Non-Member Economies (DNMEs) by deputing experts to attend the OECD Seminars/Workshops on Steel Trade Issues, Benefits of Trade and Investment Liberalisation, Practical Application of Tax Treaties, Agricultural Policies, etc.<br><br>Technical Cooperation The Technical Cooperation Division administers bilateral assistance on a Government to Government basis to 130 developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. While most countries in the world either give or receive technical assistance, India is unique in both receiving and giving technical assistance in a major way, the latter through two programmes conducted by TC Division, the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan (SCAAP) programme. In this Report, reference to ITEC will also include SCAAP as the two programmes are different only in the budget heads under which accounts are maintained.<br><br>The ITEC Programme has four major components:<br><br>(1)Training (both Civil and Military)<br><br>(2)Projects, including feasibility studies and consultancy services<br><br>(3)Deputation of Experts and<br><br>(4)Study Tours for foreign decision-makers to India. In regard to Civilian Training, 1485 slots were provided under ITEC during this year in 39 prestigious Training Institutions and Establishments (Appendix - XIII) of which 1326 slots were utilised (lists at Appendices - XIV-XV). These slots were for training in various types of courses such as Audit and Accounts, Banking, Diplomacy, Manpower Planning, Parliamentary Studies, Poultry, Rural Development, Small Scale Industries, Computers and Software, Maintenance of Biomedical Equipment, Food Processing Technology etc. During the year, a new subject "English Language for Professional Purposes" was introduced into the Programme and courses in various S&amp;T fields were conducted for Vietnam and Cuba under special Agreements.<br><br>A special training course was conducted for 25 Zimbabwean Police Officers in computer software. The wife of the Prime Minister of Senegal Mrs Silvie Aicha Loum was trained at the Fragrance and Flavour Development Centre, Kannauj and KVIC, New Delhi on production of Agarbatti and Dhoop Batti to enable her to organize Dhoop production centres for unemployed women in Senegal, using locally grown raw materials. Training slot offers to Iraqi nationals under sanction-affected Iraq were increased from 35 to 50 in the current financial year. These offers cover many fields such as agriculture, water management, desert cropping, genetic engineering, tyre industry, telecommunications and several others.<br><br>The assistance offered under ITEC is a fully self-contained package inclusive of international air passages, boarding, lodging and training costs etc. Currently, India bears an average cost of Rs.1.25 lakhs on each foreign participant under the ITEC Programme which has benefited over 10,000 nominees of foreign Governments since its inception in 1964. Demands for our training programmes are growing as during 1998-99, 1326 nominees were trained which is the highest number as compared to 1995-96 (970 nominees), 1996-97 (1001 nominees) and 1997- 98 (1031 nominees).<br><br>Every year ITEC Day is celebrated by the Indian Missions abroad on 15th September. This year the event was also celebrated at Headquarters after a gap of 5 years. The event was attended by about 350 guests consisting of Heads of Diplomatic Missions/other Diplomats of more than 60 countries who are recipients of ITEC assistance, high-level Government officials, representatives of various Training Institutes, media personnel and about 100 trainees both civilian and military trainees who were at that time undergoing training at various Institutes located at New Delhi. The gathering was addressed by the Foreign Secretary who spoke about various activities being undertaken under ITEC Programme and its future orientation. This was followed by a cultural programme presented by candidates from Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Mauritius, Uganda.<br><br>On December 14-15, 1998, a Conference of the Training Institutes empanelled under ITEC was convened at New Delhi under the Chairmanship of Secretary (ER) Shri S T Devare and addressed by AS (FA) Shri B N Jha. The Conference was the first of its kind organized by the Ministry of External Affairs and was considered timely in view of the growing potential which training and capacity building activities for promoting India's bilateral relations with the developing countries. The Conference was also useful to discuss problems of coordination between our Diplomatic Missions, the Training Institutes and TC Division and many suggestions for procedural improvements emerged from it. There was a consensus that India can be more effectively projected through the ITEC programme as an important training destination for developing countries by streamlining the effectiveness of performance at these three levels. Training Institutes, appreciating the leverage which, having an international profile, can give them to generate important commercial spin-off benefits for themselves, and by extension for the country, were urged to improve their performance under ITEC accordingly.<br><br>Military Training is another important task undertaken under ITEC Programme. TC Division is a nodal point for organizing Military Training for nominees of friendly foreign Governments in some of the more prestigious Defence institutions of India such as Indian Military Academy, National Defence College, Defence Service Staff College etc. During this year approximately 198 slots for long and short term training courses were offered under ITEC and approximately 237 slots under Self-Financing Schemes. Some slots were also offered on a reciprocal basis. Appendices - XVI-XIX contain the lists of countries whose candidates were trained under ITEC Programme.<br><br>Another important aspect of the ITEC Programme is project cooperation with partner countries. Such cooperation, extended over many years since ITEC was established in 1964, has enhanced India's image as a country which is generous insharing her experience and expertise acquired in the past fifty years of her independent existence, with other developing countries. In 1998-99 plans to establish a Plastic Technology Demonstration and Common Facility Centre in a backward region of Namibia by NSIC at a cost Rs. 3.40 crores were finalised, soon after a visit to that country by the Indian Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee. A major project to set up an Entrepreneur and Technical Development Centre (ETDC) at a cost of Rs.13 crores in Dakar (Senegal) launched last year in fulfillment of a G-15 commitment, was executed in considerable measure by HMT (I) despite initial setbacks. The Mini Dairy Plant supplied last year to Kyrghyzstan at a cost of Rs.1.75 crores has gone into production of milk and butter. Plans to send six farmers from Punjab to Burkina Faso for three years to demonstrate Indian agricultural techniques especially for growing rice, were carried further.<br><br>In addition to project assistance, the TC Division supplied equipment for upgradation of the Upadhyay Training Centre in Mauritius, irrigation pumps to Uganda, Ambulances and Incubators to the Indira Gandhi Maternity Clinic in Namibia, diesel pumps and sewing machines to Ivory Coast and textile machinery to Vietnam in 1998-99. A list of projects and project-related assistance extended this year to different countries may be seen at Appendix - XX. As of now, there are 23 experts on long term deputation (from 2 to 3 years) to various countries as advisors in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine, marine engineering, water management, accountancy, fish toxicity, teaching, legislative drafting and in military fields (list is at Appendix - XXI). Seven short-term experts have also been sent to a few countries this year. Over the years, Indian experts have been acknowledged by many developing countries to have done commendable work in building institutional frameworks for self-reliant growth with limited means.<br><br>On the recommendations of Indian Heads of Missions, Study Visits by senior level officers and decision-makers are organized every year by the TC Division from various partner countries. Visits, generally in the areas of small scale industries, agriculture, health and education, trade and commerce etc. are an extremely popular method of introducing foreign visitors to different developmental sectors in the Indian economy and polity as they offer a first- hand exposure to Indian economic conditions. Nine study visits took place in the year under review. These include a visit by Prof Alberto Simao, Chairman, National Institute for Development of Local Industry, Mozambique to see the various industries and R&amp;D centres engaged in improving the quality of products of the small-scale units under the supervision of the DCSSI. A four-member delegation from Nairobi University led by Prof D N Kariuku, Chairman, Department of Chemistry visited various Institutions and chemical industries to learn from Indian experience of the interface between academic training and commercial activity in the field of chemistry.<br><br>Also invited was a three-member delegation from Vietnam headed by Director, Cuu Long Rice Research Institute, Dr Nguyen Van Luat to visit some Agricultural Universities and see some items of agricultural machinery which are manufactured in India. Two more agricultural delegations were invited in response to interest expressed by them in knowing about our Green Revolution - (i) a four-member delegation from Mongolia headed by Mr Y A Balgansuren, Director, Department of Policy Coordination, Ministry of Industry &amp; Agriculture, and (ii) a three-member delegation from Kyrghyzstan headed by Mr Tolobek E Omuraliev, Advisor to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Head of the Department of Local Self Government and Agricultural Policy under the Presidential Administration.<br><br>The visitors were taken to our Agricultural Research &amp; Development Centres in Pusa, Karnal, Shimla, Ludhiana and for discussions with our authorities there. Mr A W Searle, Warden of the Zimbabwe Zoo was invited to interact with the Wildlife Institute in Dehra Dun. Two senior officials from the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation visited India and were shown Doordarshan and AIR facilities with a view to long-term cooperation between India and Namibia in this important sector of information and communication technology. Mr Patrick Mandago, Namibian Chief of Protocol visited to study the functioning of the Protocol Division of the Ministry. Sometimes, a study visit is arranged to acquire expertise from the visitors as was the case when Mr J R Muller, General Manager of a South African Government- owned Company called Abakor came to India to advise the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on improvements in its abattoirs in Delhi and Aligarh, also during this year.<br><br>Under the Aid to Disaster Relief Programme (ADR), TC Division provides humanitarian aid for disaster relief to various countries, in the form of medicines, clothing, food etc. In the current financial year, medicines and foodgrain were sent to Bangladesh for victims of some of the worst floods that the country has known. Afghanistan's earthquake victims were assisted with medicine, blankets, tents and biscuits. Many other countries such as Comoros, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Sudan, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Peru, Tajikistan and Kyrghyzstan received quantities of medicines and other forms of assistance depending upon their expressed requirements. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean affected Hurricanes George and Mitch respectively were also assisted with small quantities of medicines and surgical instruments under the ADR programme. A complete list of the relief supplied by India under this programme in 1998-99 may be seen at Appendix - XXII.

Major thrust areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power, telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment Promotion and Publicity Division to actively undertake effective investment promotion and publicity efforts, particularly through the Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missions are the first point of contact for the foreign investor.<br><br>It is, therefore, essential that the Missions are given full back-up support in their efforts in the form of providing up-to-date information about the economy, the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and opportunities available in different sectors, the incentives offered by the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these and related matters the Investment Promotion and Publicity (IPP) Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments or other agencies, as the case may be.<br><br>Policy The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever required, based on investment trends world-wide and based on the need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and our economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the Missions on foreign investor perceptions about India's investment policies or about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving as inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national interest. The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), where it was represented by Secretary (Economic Relations). Investments from NRIs were given particular attention. FIPB was also empowered to give a firm 'Yes' or 'No' answer to every proposal involving FDI within a deadline of 60 days.<br><br>Promotional Efforts and Initiatives The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably projecting the various investment policies and announcements of the Government by co-ordinating with the Missions on the one hand and various economic Ministries of the Central Government and State Governments on the other. Economic news about India was regularly disseminated to all the Missions highlighting major policy decisions and new opportunities, thus keeping them abreast of developments. Missions were also encouraged to hold investment promotion seminars and workshops besides extending investment support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of our Missions in identified target countries. Ministry also undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures and opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.<br><br>The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations. The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by the Missions, visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having appropriate meetings with concerned Government Departments, the Apex Chambers of Commerce, the State Governments etc. The Ministry also participated in many bilateral or other meetings/conferences involving overseas investor groups. Among the many delegations was also a 30-member International Public Affairs's Centre (IPAC) delegation which visited India from 17-20 January, 1999. The IPAC is an association of Presidents of multinational corporations and currently has 150 leading business houses among its members.<br><br>The Ministry also actively assisted various organisations in the country such as the apex chambers, Exim Bank, Indian Investment Centre, in organising investment/trade promotion events in India including the Global Indian Entrepreneurs Conference (12-13 November, 1998), India Economic Summit (29 November-1 December, 1998), various joint business councils and other events. The Ministry actively participated in the efforts to mobilise good response for the Resurgent India Bond Scheme launched by the State Bank of India to which our Missions lent full support. Eventually, the scheme proved a success mobilising over US$ 4.16 billion.<br><br>Publicity The following publications were brought out this year by the IPP Division for the use of our Missions and Posts: a)The IPP Division brought out an illustrative brochure "India - Investment Related Websites" in August 1998. The brochure gives information regarding website location and home page of several of the economic ministries of Government of India, the State Governments and a number of other investment related agencies.<br><br>b)IPP Division in association with World Link, which is the magazine of the World Economic Forum and Investor Access, a CD-ROM publisher in UK, brought out a CD-ROM on "India - Priorities for the 21st Century" in August 1998. This is a unique multimedia guide to India for Investors conveying a comprehensive picture about the evolving scene in India as the country moves towards the 21st Century. Industrial and investment policies of all the State and Union Territories have been featured along with analysis of 20 different sectors, each highlighting the potential for growth and the vast opportunities opening up. The CD also has a complete guide for foreign investors on policies and procedures for foreign investment.

These covered issues of longer term relevance to broad foreign policy objectives. The Division prepared analytical position papers for Ministry's interaction with other agencies. The Division continued to serve as a nodal point for interaction with Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the University Grants Commission (UGC) and its affiliates and the Area Study Centres (ASC) located in various universities and specialising in research on various regions of the world.<br><br>The Division extended financial assistance to various academic institutions/think tanks located in different parts of the country for holding conferences, seminars, preparation of research papers, exchange of scholars and support for Track-II programmes on issues related to India's external relations and security.<br><br>The subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects covered Nationalism in Russia and Central Asian Republics, Indo-China Workshop on Nation Building, Air Transport and Tourism, Indo-Japan Relations, Japan-South Asia Cooperation in the post Cold War Years, Vietnam Today and Indo-Vietnam Relations, 50 Years of Republic of Korea: Indo-Korea Relations.

The Centre for Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, USA is also given an annual; recurring grant by the Division. As part of its interactive functions, the Division took the initiative in promoting exchanges with official and non-official visiting experts and projected India's views and perceptions on important issues.<br><br>The Division continued to edit and publish the Annual Report of the Ministry. The Report served as a compendium of India's interaction with the rest of the world in the political, economic and cultural fields, including the views of the government on various facets of international relations. The Division rendered all possible assistance to the territorial divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific information or document on international relations was required. The Research Wing examined the depiction of India's international boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through Indian Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The Division also scrutinised foreign publications containing maps depicting India's external boundaries before these were imported into the county and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such matters. It coordinated the supply of map- sheets to various Government and semi-Government agencies for use in their official work with the Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The Research Wing dealt with requests from research scholars for access to the records of the Ministry.<br><br>In support of research, the Ministry's Library has modern information technology equipment and rich resource materials, with over one hundred thousand books and a large collection of maps, microfilms and official documents. The Library receives and maintains 600 periodical titles. It has in-house computer systems with fifteen terminals, two of which support data entry and retrieval in Hindi.

It involves the dissemination of news about developments pertaining to India and India's views and concerns on national and international issues. Opinion makers are kept informed about developments in India in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres with particular reference to issues having a bearing on India's external relations and foreign policy. Following the nuclear tests by India in May 1998, this function became dominant and was effectively handled.<br><br>The External Publicity Division and Missions/Posts abroad worked in unison to enlarge areas of positive perception about the country while attempting to build greater awareness and understanding of its policies and values. Some focus areas included: India's millennial history and its civilisation; its diverse and profound religious and philosophical traditions; its democratic and secular political culture and institutions, its pluralistic, tolerant and accommodative social ethos; its wide experience in nation building; its impressive economic, scientific and technological achievements, its colossal market potential and, its strategic perceptions including its evolving nuclear policy. Audio visual and print material was used to achieve these objectives.<br><br>In its key function as the office of the Official Spokesman of the Government of India on all matters pertaining to India's external affairs, the External Publicity Division strove to orient the domestic and international media on a day to day basis on India's foreign policy perspectives and on topical issues, particularly the nuclear policy through regular briefings and public relations efforts. Over 200 Press Releases and Statements were issued by the Division the year, upto November 1998, and distributed amongst Indian and foreign media, Indian missions abroad, foreign missions in India and also made available on the MEA internet website. The 'Foreign Affairs Record', a compilation of all press releases, visits, agreements and significant diplomatic developments, was brought out on a monthly basis. The Division's news dissemination function also included news bulletins sent out to India's Missions/Posts abroad on a twice - daily basis; a newspaper clipping service on external affairs coverage from the national media for Indian Missions and for senior officials of the Ministry; and, news on the Ministry's internet website.<br><br>Eight documentaries were aquired from Surabhi on Education, Art, Music, Dance, Handicrafts, Development and Culture for non-commercial publicity through our Missions/ Posts abroad. Copies of these films were sent to our Missions/ Posts abroad as part of our publicity exercise. Further, documentaries on Progressive Indian Women; India in Space; The North-East; The Changing Face of Indian Countryside; Flute; Confluences in North Indian Music; New Frontiers of Information Era; The Indian Experience; A Nation Celebrates; The Empire Writes Back; The Rooted Imagination; Dreaming Young Dreaming Global; Transition Times; Indian Achievements in Agricultural Sciences and Technology; Buddhist Heritage of Ladakh; The Nuclear Issue; Saarc- 10th Summit in Colombo; Fragrance of Love; Traditional Heritage of India; and, The Victoria Memorial were commissioned and are at various stages of completion. Many documentaries were telecast on local TV networks abroad including The Making of a Nation, A Nation Celebrates, India- Trysts with Destiny, Theatre of India, Magic in the Making, Nauka Caritramu, and 100 Years of Cinema through 40 Missions on the occasion of Independence Day and were well received. This was in addition to other documentaries aired from time to time by the local TV networks abroad. The Star TV and Asianet networks also aired our documentaries.<br><br>CD-ROMs on Desi Khana, Multimedia Journey, India Beckons, Hindi Guru, Mahabharta, India Mystica, India Festiva, Krishna were sent to each Mission/Post abroad. Copies of MEA's CD-ROM "India Timeless Civilisation-Vibrant Democracy" were also sent to all Missions/Posts abroad. 2400 gift sets of two video cassettes of film "Making of a Nation" a ten part series and VHS cassettes in gift packs were sent to all Missions/Posts abroad for presentation purposes. XP Division extended its support and cooperation for festivals organised abroad. These included, inter-alia, Film Festivals in Houston, Tokyo, St.Denis, Copenhagen, Tripoli, Malta, Damascus, and the Eager University Film Festival in Budapest. Indian Film Festivals in 23 other Missions were organised during the golden jubilee celebrations of India's Independence. Further, XP division contributed to 35 other film festivals organised by various missions/posts abroad. Apart from this, the division assisted the Directorate of Film Festivals in organising Film Festivals abroad under its aegis.<br><br>54 prints of eight feature films based on the Freedom Struggle namely: Gandhi, Sardar, Nehru, Garam Hawa, Tamas, 22nd June 1897, Making of the Mahatma and Train to Pakistan were acquired, sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic and sent to missions abroad for film festivals. 175 prints of various feature films in 16/35mm format were sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic languages through NFDC, Mumbai.<br><br>Activity on the Photo Publicity side also increased substantially. Collections of large size photographs were sent to Missions abroad for special photo exhibitions in connection with the 50th anniversary of Indians Independence. On the occasion of the Independence Day, 1500 prints were sent to various missions and posts abroad for special supplements in local newspapers. Cataloging, computerisation and inventor formation of the entire stock of feature films, documentary films, U-Matic/Betacam cassettes, video programmes, photographs and transparencies was completed during the year. Active assistance was provided to our Missions/Posts abroad in promoting their publicity effort by providing them with tourist literature, photographs and pamphlets.<br><br>The foreign media continued to show a keen interest in India through visits by media delegations and TV teams. The entry of India into the 'Nuclear Club' in May 1998, further stimulated incoming media visits. The XP Division provided assistance to them, including briefing them, as well as seeking appointments with senior Ministers, senior officials, academicians, representatives of business houses and chambers of commerce. This Division also invited foreign media persons to facilitate foreign journalists in gaining a first hand experience of India. In 1998, 120 journalists, individually or as part of media and TV delegations, visited India from the Phillipines, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Nepal, Malaysia, Turkey, Pakistan , China, Kenya, Mexico, UAE, USA, Sri Lanka, Senegal, Cyprus, South Africa, Czechlovakia, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco, Kyrgyztan, Uzbekistan, Croatia, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. These visits generated extensive coverage on India in the foreign media and in creating a better understanding of our country.<br><br>Another important job handled by this Division was making media arrangements for delegations accompanying the Heads of State or Government on visits to India. This assistance entailed facilitating media coverage, arranging press briefings and providing other logistical arrangements. During the year, VVIP visits were received from France, Canada, Maldives, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Belarus, Belgium, Chile and Switzerland. Visits from South Africa, Russia, Thailand and Sri Lanka are expected by the end of the year. The XP Division also handled all logistical arrangements for Indian media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and the Prime Minister on their state visits abroad to Peru, Brazil, USA, Nepal, Germany, Luxembourg Portugal, Turkey, Cairo (G-15 Summit), Colombo (SAARC Summit), Durban (NAM Summit), Namibia, Oman, Mauritius, Jamaica (G-15), Trinidad and Tobago and Morocco. The division effectively contributed during these visits by setting up and operating media centres and looking after all logistical arrangements for the Indian media - locally based and travelling with the VVIPs.<br><br>One of the important jobs entrusted to this Division is the clearance of documentary proposals received from documentary makers all over the world. Out of over 360 proposals received, 85 per cent were cleared, while others were awaiting approvals from central and state governments.<br><br>There are more than 300 foreign journalists of various foreign news agencies and organisations based in India. An important aspect of this Division's work has been to provide accreditation facilities and give clearances for renewal of visas to these journalists. With more and more news agencies setting up bureau offices in India, work related to this aspect increased this year, especially following the nuclear tests. A number of new Bureau were opened during the year.<br><br>The supply of books, magazines, journals and other periodicals on a wide range of issues for use in the Missions' libraries and for distribution to local dignitaries abroad, opinion makers and academic institutions continued during the year. Based on the feedback received from various targetted groups, the Division supplied material suitable to their requirements. More than fifty different books were purchased for distribution to our Missions/Posts, including the Booker Prize Winner, "God of Small Things", a highly valued photographic book by Lindsay Hebberd on the Cultural and Socio-economic spectrum of India- "Cultural Portraits", "Indian Experience" on the diverse aspects of India, a foreign publication on India, "India Unveiled", "India 2020: A Vision for new Millennium" by eminent scientist APJ Abdul Kalam, a collection of writings on India by a team of accomplished journalists of international news agencies titled 'Assignment India', and others including some specifically meant for children.<br><br>The two important publications of External Publicity Division in Coffee table book format, viz. "India Continuity in Change" and "India: A Dynamic Democracy", were distributed to our missions abroad. The reprinting of the revised publicaiton "India A Dynamic Democracy" in English was completed and 6000 copies were distributed to our Missions/Posts abroad for publicity purposes. In view of the rising demand, their publication was commissioned in other languages like French, German, Russian, Arabic and Spanish. The Division continued to assist ICCR and UN/ITEC Divisions in the production of their publications.<br><br>Over Fifty five thousand copies of India Perspectives, a prestigious monthly magazine published by the XP Division in ten different languages, were distributed through Indian Missions and Posts abroad. The magazine was also made available on the MEA website to cover a wider audience. Besides highlighting India's historical and cultural heritage, the journal has been focussing on the impressive progress made by India in all facets of life, achievements in the area of Science and Technology and the steps taken to globalise the country's economy. A special issue of this magazine on Nuclear India was brought out in the month of September 1998 to supplement the efforts of projecting India's viewpoint on the nuclear issue.<br><br>The international media was monitored using inputs from Missions abroad. Negative and adverse reports in the international media on India' s nuclear tests were rebutted by the Indian missions through interviews/letters in influential papers and appearances on TV channels as well as other engagements. Compilations of reportage in the international media, on the nuclear and other relevant issues were circulated in the Ministry; to the Indian media; and to Indian Missions abroad. The comments by foreign journalists, political leaders and intellectuals of international repute highlighting India's point of view were circulated widely and also put up on the MEA's internet website.<br><br>Special supplements were brought out in 'The New York Times' and 'The Washington Post' containing commissioned articles on India's nuclear policy by eminent personalities. Missions abroad also brought out supplements in the local papers throughout the world on Independence Day and Republic Day. India's nuclear policy, foreign policy issues, India's economy, culture, science and technology achievements were some of the focus areas. A section on India's nuclear policy was opened on MEA's website after the nuclear tests and this was appreciated by many international agencies and commended by 'The Los Angeles Times', BBC and many others. The fact that information on the Ministry's website at www.indiagov.org and www.meadev.gov.in was well received could be gauged from the 2.2 million hits received by the site per month. Action has been initiated to enhance the role of the website through its technical enhancement as well as substantive enrichment and updating.</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>1999</th></tr><tr><td>Protocol<br><br>State Visits by Heads of State / Government/ Vice Presidents/ Crown Prince to India<br><br>1.H.

Oman uu</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>1999</th></tr><tr><td>Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas<br><br>The Passports and Consular services represent the principal domain of activity in which the Ministry of External Affairs has a direct interface with the general public. Apart from constituting a public service, the issue of a passport also has a bearing on a vital component of India's foreign policy viz., the export of Indian manpower, expertise and technology abroad. The large Indian community resident abroad constitutes a dynamic link between India and the rest of the world. In an era in which the international scene has witnessed momentous changes, the people of Indian origin abroad have played a significant role in promoting India's interests and in contributing towards the strengthening of India's political and economic relations with their respective countries of adoption.<br><br>Passport Services Efforts to fulfil the Government's commitments under the Citizens' Charter were taken forward in 1998 through various measures aimed at providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport Offices. A new Passport Office at Pune and three new Passport Collection Centres at Surat, Gangtok and Aurangabad were opened during the year. The Passport Rules were amended to allow for sixty page (Jumbo) passport booklets which is very convenient to frequent travellers in this increasingly globalising world. For less frequent travellers a passport with validity upto 20 years has been introduced.<br><br>Separate passports for minors were also introduced to bring the practice in India in line with that prevalent internationally. This has been done to eliminate the chances of inconvenience to the passport holder when they approach some foreign Missions for visas. Some of the countries which insist on a separate passport for children before giving them visa are USA, UK, Canada, Japan and almost all European countries.<br><br>Special efforts were made to reduce the pendency of applications in various Passport Offices for which standard monitoring procedures were devised and regular inspections of the Passport Offices institutionalised. The Annual Passport Officers Conference was held on 8 October, 1998 at which emphasis was placed on the need to effectively redress public grievances. A review of the Passports Act and Rules was initiated and Passport Officers asked to consider introducing the practice of periodical 'Passport Adalats'.<br><br>Extensive measures have been initiated to simplify and streamline various procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous services promptly and efficiently in keeping with our commitment under the Citizens' Charter. Comprehensive instructions liberalizing grant of duplicate passports were issued to various Passport Issuing Authorities.<br><br>From the mid 80s when the Ministry had first launched a project to computerise a few passport offices in a phased manner, already 15 passport offices including those in the metropolitan cities have been comprehensively computerised. Other passport offices are also in the process of being computerised. A proposal for a comprehensive satellite based computer programming and connectivity as well as the creation of a central Processing Cell is being fromulated. MEA also went through a process of open tendering and bids for completely overhauling the existing system and to take advantage of the latest available technology.<br><br>However, due to certain technicalities the bids had to be returned in September 1998. It was decided thereafter to appoint Department of Electronics as a consultant for preparing a fresh tender document especially with regard to the technical specifications for the project. The report has been received and the tender documents are expected to be finalised and issued shortly. It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house the Passport Offices in Government owned properties. MEA has acquired plots of land/built-up properties in various cities in India to this effect. We have 28 Passport Offices in India of which five Passport Offices at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Cochin and Kozhikode are already operating from Government buildings.<br><br>Construction work is in progress at 6 places viz. Ahmedabad for office and residential complex; Cochin (residential complex), Hyderabad (Office complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji and Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been initiated at another nine places i.e. Banagalore, Chennai, Lucknow, Jaipur, Trivandram, Chandigarh, Trichy, Jammu and Calcutta.<br><br>The number of applications received during the year for grant of passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. continued to rise in keeping with the overall climate of liberalisation and increased travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 22,22,786 fresh passports were issued and 3,08,214 miscellaneous services rendered. Detailed figures of receipts of passports issued/various services rendered including the revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices are at Appendix IV.<br><br>PIO Card The six million Indian citizens and over twenty million People of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have collectively evolved into a major instrument for the furtherance of India's foreign policy. Recognising their significant role in the shaping of the country's destiny, Government announced the introduction of a PIO Card for Persons of Indian Origin settled in countries to be specified by Government which would, besides introducing a visa free regime, also confer some special economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits. A user-friendly software has also been developed which will enable the Indian Missions abroad to compile and maintain a uniform database on the NRIs/PIOs.<br><br>Consular Services As part of the drive towards modernisation of consular services, new secure visa stickers were introduced at all the Indian diplomatic Missions and Posts abroad from 1 August, 1998. In keeping with ICAO recommendations, efforts are continuing to introduce more secure and machine readable passports and visas. There was renewed emphasis on the need to cater to the consular needs of Overseas Indians and to render them efficient and timely assistance through the Indian diplomatic Missions abroad. Problems encountered by Non-Resident Indians/workers especially in the Gulf countries, including disputes with their employers/sponsors were sought to be promptly redressed. Government maintained regular contact with the Governments of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism of the Joint Commission, with the objective of resolving consular problems and ameliorating the condition of Indian workers in those countries.<br><br>In cases of deaths of Indians abroad immediate assistance was arranged by our Missions and Posts for completing the formalities for early despatch of the mortal remains while maintaining liaison with the local and Indian authorities as well as the relatives of the deceased. In several countries various amnesty schemes were announced for regularising the stay of illegal immigrants in those countries. Special drives were launched to cater to the specific requirements of affected Indian nationals by way of expeditious issue of Emergency Certificates/travel documents and other requisite assistance. During the year, 9383 Indians were arrested abroad and 4783 deaths of Indian abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary of the consular data for the year 1998 is at Annexure 'B'.<br><br>Visas India's more than 150 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to over 1.64 million foreigners during 1998. The procedure for grant of visa by our Missions and Posts is user friendly, quick and efficient. Many Missions and Posts give visas either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas within 48 hours. To keep pace with increasing automation, the Consular Wing in HCI London has been computerised which has reduced the time spent by applicants in the queues as well as at the counter. Computerisation has also speeded up the processing of application for visas. The Ministry is actively considering computerisation of some other Consular Wings in North America where the volume of services rendered is high.<br><br>Bilateral Agreements As part of the global endeavour to counter terrorism, and acknowledging the growing international dimensions of crime, consular agreements and institutional mechanisms were negotiated with several countries. These negotiations included over two dozen Extradition Treaties, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties in Criminal and Civil Matters as well as Consular Conventions. During the visit of Russian Prime Minister to India in December, 1998 an Extradition Treaty, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters and Consular Convention were signed. Official and technical level consultations were held with Bulgaria and Tunisia for finalising bilateral Extradition Treaties. While certain issues still remained to be sorted out with Bulgaria, an Extradition Treaty draft has been finalised and initialled with Tunisia on February 9, 1999.<br><br>With France and UAE the Extradition Treaties were initialled. However, as subsequently some changes have been suggested by both sides the two treaties are being further negotiated. The Ministry is currently addressing several requests for extradition and other legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal and civil and commercial charges. The request for extradition emanates from our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or extradition arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year six fresh requests were processed in addition to the ongoing cases.<br><br>During the year, 2,36,120 documents were accorded consular attestation in CPV Division of which 1,47,069 were commercial documents.

The work is expected to be completed by the end of March 1999.<br><br>Central Passport Organisation The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) man the 28 passport offices and 12 existing Passport Collection Centres. The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1595 with 145 officers and 1450 non-gazetted staff. During the year the All India Passport Employees Association was recognised by the Government. One of the major demands of the employees is for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review has been formulated during the year and is being processed.<br><br>As the volume of work as well as the network of Passport Offices and Passport Collection Centres has been growing over the years, the Ministry is considering a proposal to create a Central Passport Authority with a view to grant greater autonomy to the Passport Offices to achieve greater efficiency and higher productivity.<br><br>Vision Our goal is to set up a clean, transparent and efficient passport issuing service which the MEA can be justifiably proud of and which the general public can be genuinely satisfied about. The system should also be sensitive and responsive to the special needs of the public. uu<br><br>INDIA USA CANADA UNITED KINGDOM JAPAN PERU CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MALI RUSSIA BULGARIA TUNISIA FRANCE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES<br><br>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report<br><br>1998<br>16<br><br>Administration and Organisation<br>Following the general elections in February/March 1998, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee assumed charge of the office of Prime Minister on March 18, 1998, with the additional charge of the Ministry of External Affairs.

It was decided to further expand and intesify bilateral ties in these fields and institute a mechanism for regular consultations between the Foreign Offices of the two countries. Pakistan Overview Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee took a historic initiative to visit Lahore on February 20-21, 1999 on the inaugural run of the Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service.<br><br>His visit was part of India's consistent efforts to build peaceful, friendly and cooperative ties with Pakistan and establish a relationship based on mutual respect and a regard for each other's concerns. Earlier, the resumption of the official dialogue between the two countries in October 1998 marked a success in India's endeavours to engage Pakistan in a composite and comprehensive dialogue process that would build trust and confidence, explore avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation and address outstanding issues. A crucial element in Pakistan's attitude and approach towards India, however, was its engaging in terrorism, firing across the international border and Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and hostile propaganda.<br><br>Prime Minister's Visit India's basic policy approach towards Pakistan was underlined by Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee's declaration that a stable, prosperous and secure Pakistan was in India's interest. This sentiment was reaffirmed by him from the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore on February 21, 1999. Prime Minister's visit was the most significant engagement between India and Pakistan in over a quarter of a century. It was also the first visit undertaken by the Prime Minister of India to Pakistan in a decade. During his visit, the Prime Minister conveyed to the Government and people of Pakistan India's deep desire for peace and friendship with them and for developing a comprehensive structure of cooperation for the benefit of the two peoples.<br><br>The Prime Minister and the Pakistan Prime Minister signed the Lahore Declaration which is a landmark for peace and security of the two countries. A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed by the Foreign Secretaries under which India and Pakistan will work to enter into agreements to put into place far-reaching Confidence Building Measures. In a Joint Statement issued on the occasion, the two countries also identified new and significant areas of cooperation such as Information Technology and decided to address humanitarian issues at a ministerial level on an urgent basis. India expects that the Prime Minister's historic initiative for the welfare of the peoples of the two countries will mark a new chapter in our bilateral ties. Resumption of Official Dialogue Prime Minister had met Pakistan Prime Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the Tenth SAARC Summit at Colombo (29 July, 1998) and in New York (23 September, 1998).<br><br>During these meetings, Prime Minister urged Pakistan to work with India to develop trust and confidence, avail of the many opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation and address outstanding issues. Prime Minister also emphasised that Pakistan's instigation of and support to terrorism against India were incompatible with the development of peaceful and friendly relations and that these activities must cease immediately. During Prime Minister's meeting with Prime Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif in New York on 23 September, 1998, the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan reported to the two Prime Ministers that they had reached an agreement on the modalities of the dialogue process.<br><br>(The subjects for the dialogue were agreed upon in June 1997 and are: Peace &amp; Security including CBMs, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Siachen, Tulbul Navigation Project, Sir Creek, Economic and Commercial Cooperation, Terrorism and Drug Trafficking and Promotion of Friendly Exchanges in various fields). The Prime Ministers welcomed this development and issued directions for the resumption of the dialogue. The first round of the composite dialogue process was held in October and November 1998. The subjects of Peace &amp; Security including CBMs and Jammu &amp; Kashmir were discussed by the Foreign Secretaries in Islamabad in October 1998. The subjects of Tulbul Navigation Project, Siachen, Sir Creek, Economic and Commercial Cooperation, Terrorism and Drug Trafficking and Promotion of Friendly Exchanges in various fields were discussed, respectively, by the Secretary, Water Resources of India and Secretary, Water and Power of Pakistan; the Defence Secretaries; the Surveyor General of India and Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence, of Pakistan; the Commerce Secretaries; the Home Secretary of India and the Interior Secretary of Pakistan; and the Culture Secretaries, in New Delhi in November 1998.<br><br>During talks on Peace &amp; Security including CBMs, India drew Pakistan's attention to India's security needs which were a function of its size and assets. India emphasised that its security concerns were not one-country specific and that its defence profile was non-aggressive. In this context, India proposed the upgradation of existing CBMs and the need to put in place new CBMs, ranging from information exchange and improved communication links to exchanging views on security concepts and nuclear doctrines. India also emphasised the need to build mutual confidence in the nuclear and conventional fields. During discussions on Jammu &amp; Kashmir, India made it clear that the legal status of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, i.e. that the entire State is an integral part of India, is clear and does not admit of any change. India also demanded that Pakistan cease forthwith its futile instigation and sponsorship of terrorism in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, which constituted a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Simla Agreement.<br><br>During talks on the Tulbul Navigation Project, India drew Pakistan's attention to understandings that had been reached during earlier discussions on this subject and that can be the basis for a resolution of the issue. During discussions on Siachen, India stressed the need for a cease fire in the area as a first step. On the subject of Sir Creek, India proposed that, pending agreement on the land boundary, the maritime boundary could be demarcated by starting at sea and proceeding landwards. At the discussions on Terrorism and Drug Trafficking, India gave Pakistan detailed evidence regarding its role in sponsoring terrorism against India and demanded that Pakistan close down training camps for terrorists and hand over terrorists and fugitives from the law who have been given sanctuary in Pakistan.<br><br>During discussions on Economic and Commercial Cooperation, India emphasised that there were many avenues for mutually beneficial cooperation including in areas such as electric power and transportation. Detailed discussions on the technical, legal and financial aspects at the expert-level have taken place in Islamabad and New Delhi on the subject of purchase of power by India from Pakistan. These discussions are continuing. On the subject of Promotion of Friendly Exchanges, India proposed a cultural exchange programme which would build on the commonalities between the two countries. India also emphasised the need of regular contacts to address humanitarian issue relating to fishermen and civilian prisoners and people-to- people contacts.<br><br>India released a total of 149 Pakistani fishermen in its custody. It also proposed to Pakistan that the fishermen of the two countries who stray innocently into the territorial waters of the other country should not be kept in custody but should be released on completion of formalities. Acting on this principle, India conveyed to Pakistan on 2 November 1998 its decision to release 40 Pakistani fishermen who were captured on 24 October, 1998. Pakistan also released 190 Indian fishermen who were held in its custody. India took the initiative to start a Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service. An agreement and a protocol for the regulation of this service were signed in Islamabad on 17 February, 1999. Trial runs of an Indian bus to Pakistan and a Pakistani bus to India had been held in January 1999.<br><br>Pakistan's Support to Terrorism Pakistan's support to and involvement in terrorist activities in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and other parts of India continues unabated. This was strongly taken up by Prime Minister during his visit to Pakistan, and also by Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary during the dialogue process. It was pointed out that the atmosphere generated by the open exhortation of terrorist actions in India by fundamentalist organisations in Pakistan, many of which enjoyed official patronage, was not conducive to a normalisation of bilateral relations. India urged that Pakistan take urgent steps to demonstrate its commitment to tackling the issue of terrorism.<br><br>Pakistan's Nuclear and Missile Programmes India has carefully been following Pakistan's pursuit of clandestine weapons oriented nuclear and missile programmes, which have been developed with assistance from abroad. On 6 April, 1998, Pakistan announced the successful test of a ballistic missile, the Hatf V (Ghauri). Pakistan also announced that it had conducted tests of six nuclear devices on 28-30 May, 1998. It said that the tests were in reaction to India's nuclear tests carried out earlier in May 1998. In response to these tests, Government of India's official spokesman said that this event vindicated India's assessment regarding the nature of Pakistani programme and policy as well as the measures India had taken. He also said that Government of India had taken all steps necessary for safeguarding the nation's security.<br><br>Conclusion India seeks a relationship of trust, friendship and cooperation with Pakistan. Our approaches to Pakistan are rooted in our national consensus, which favours moving relations ahead with Pakistan over a broad front through the composite dialogue process. These approaches derive their strength from our confidence as a mature nation dedicated to peace, democracy and freedom. It is our earnest hope to build-on the opportunities that are now available on account of the Prime Minister's initiative and his commitment to put behind past connections and think of the welfare of coming generations. The Lahore Declaration and the Memorandum of Understanding on Confidence Building Measures and the Joint Statement are significant developments in our bilateral relations. We trust Pakistan will fully reciprocate our initiatives and abandon the path of confrontation and promotion of terrorism in India.<br><br>Section 2<br><br>India's relations with its eastern and southern neighbours- Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives and Sri Lanka - reflected a continuity of policy and approach in the development of close understanding and active collaboration in mutually beneficial development efforts. There was focus on sectors of specific interest to each of the countries concerned covering a wide range of areas. Equally important was the sustained dialogue covering ongoing matters of operational importance such as border management. The economic and social dimensions however provided the thrust for progress in increased engagement. Bangladesh There was mutual keenness on the part of both India and Bangladesh to promote understanding and to strengthen bilateral relations during the year.<br><br>everal high level visits contributed to this process. The foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Mr Abdus Samad Azad, visited India in April 1998 as the Special Envoy of the Bangladesh Prime Minister, to greet the new Government. The Bangladesh Prime Minister, Mrs Sheikh Hasina visited India on June 16, 1998; at the talks held during the visit, both sides agreed on the need to intensify the existing warm and cordial relations between the two countries and to increase interaction at various levels through economic and cultural exchanges, parliamentary delegations, students, and cultural groups.<br><br>The two Prime Ministers met again on the sidelines of the 10th SAARC Summit at Colombo in July 1998.

The Government of India rushed over 7.5 tonnes of medicines worth Rs. 40 lakhs to Bangladesh by air. India also gifted 20,000 tonnes of par-boiled rice worth Rs. 22 crores and over 800 tonnes of wheat and maize seeds worth Rs. 2.2 crores. India's relations with Bangladesh are thus close, friendly and extensive. There is widespread people-to-people contact as established by the fact that the High Commission of India in Dhaka issues an average of 1000 visas daily. Thousands of students from Bangladesh pursue higher studies in India.

The Sri Lankan leader of the Opposition, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, visited India in April 1998. The Prime Minister's visit to Colombo from 28-31 July, 1998 to attend the Tenth SAARC Summit helped to further cement the multifaceted ties between the two countries. The President of Sri Lanka, H.E. Mrs Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, paid a state visit to India from December 27-30, 1998.

The two countries also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to set up the India-Sri Lanka Foundation. The Foundation would promote bilateral exchanges in various spheres and would be governed by an independent board.<br><br>The deliberations during the visit reflected the priority attached by both countries to sustaining the warmth and understanding that mark the India-Sri Lanka relationship. Earlier, the fourth Session of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Commissions met at New Delhi on December 18, 1998. The Indian delegation was led by the Minister of External Affairs, while the Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Lakshman Kadirgamar led the Sri Lankan delegation.

SAARC Overview Regional cooperation in South Asia under the framework of SAARC gained further momentum during the year 1998.<br><br>The Tenth SAARC Summit in Colombo in July 1998 reaffirmed the desire of all SAARC leaders to strengthen cooperation in the region, particularly in the economic field. India took some bold initiatives to speed up trade liberalisation in the region with the lifting of Quantitative Restrictions for SAARC countries with effect from 1 August, 1998. Cooperation in the core economic areas was further consolidated with the conclusion of the Third Round of SAPTA negotiations in November 1998. SAARC leaders also agreed that there should be a separate Treaty for a South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and negotiations on this Treaty are to commence in early 1999.<br><br>New initiatives were taken to develop cooperation in the field of Information and the Media and in Telecommunications with the first meetings of the Ministers of Information and Telecommunications. The gains of the past were assessed and a perspective plan for SAARC for the next two decades was provided by the Group of Eminent Persons constituted by SAARC leaders in 1997. Their Report presented at the Colombo Summit in July 1998 sets out a substantial agenda for economic integration in three phases and for cooperation in the social sectors upto the year 2020. The range of SAARC cooperation is evident from the sixty meetings and activities that took place at various levels during the year starting from the Summit down to the Ministerial, official and technical levels. Highlights of the activities are as follows: Ministerial and Other Meetings The First SAARC Information Ministers Meeting, Dhaka, Bangladesh (24-25 April, 1998)<br><br>The Meeting adopted the Dhaka Communiqu� containing a SAARC Plan of Action for developing cooperation in the field of Media and Information.

The Summit took some significant decisions to advance cooperation in the core economic areas of trade and investment. A Group of Experts from all seven SAARC Countries will be set up to commence negotiations on an Agreement or Treaty for a South Asian Free Trade Area. This Agreement will spell out binding schedules for freeing trade and is expected to be finalised and put in place by 2001.<br><br>This would provide a predictable and transparent blue- print for achieving a Free Trade Area in South Asia. The Agreement will also include special facilitative measures for the Least Developed Countries. Negotiations for deepening and widening trade preferences under the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement will continue in parallel. SAARC leaders at their meeting in Colombo directed that the Third Round of SAPTA negotiations should be concluded quickly and also directed that the Fourth Round of SAPTA negotiations should commence immediately thereafter, with the mandate of extending deeper tariff concessions to products which are being actively traded or are likely to be traded. Discriminatory trade practices and non-tariff barriers are to be simultaneously removed on items in respect of which tariff concessions are granted. This would ensure that we continue to liberalise trade, even as the negotiations for a SAFTA Agreement are underway.<br><br>India took some bold initiatives to enhance access to its market. The Prime Minister announced that India would lift Quantitative Restrictions for SAARC countries with effect from August 1, 1998. This involves putting over 2000 products on Open General License for SAARC countries and has been widely welcomed.

This was appreciated as an indication of India's commitment to encourage a greater flow of Indian investment in its immediate neighbourhood.<br><br>India also offered to consider bilateral free trade arrangements with those countries who are interested in moving faster. This is expected to reinforce regional trade liberalisation and impart added momentum to the process. Sri Lanka has taken up this offer. Significant decisions were also taken to strengthen cooperation in the social sectors. SAARC leaders agreed in Colombo to draw up a Social Charter for SAARC setting out regional goals in the important areas of population stabilisation, education, health, nutrition, child welfare and women's development. Particular focus has been placed on the persistent problem of poverty in the region and the leaders of SAARC countries have committed themselves to the eradication of poverty in South Asia preferably by the year 2002. A three-tier institutional structure to evolve cooperation in this field has been set up. These three tiers comprise: A Group of Secretaries to Governments dealing with Poverty Eradication and Social Development; the Group of Finance/Planning Secretaries; and SAARC Finance/Planning Ministers.<br><br>This mechanism is a forum for exchange of information on poverty eradication programmes, strategies and technologies. The impact of structural adjustment programmes and economic liberalisation on weaker sections of society has been kept in focus through the involvement of Finance/Planning Ministers at the highest level. The text of the Regional Convention to Combat Illegal Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution was finalised. SAARC leaders agreed that the scope of the Convention could be expanded in time to cover trafficking for other purposes. The Convention is expected to be signed at the next SAARC Summit in Kathmandu. A separate Convention on Child Welfare is also under discussion. A new initiative has been taken to develop cooperation in the field of Distance Education. A SAARC Forum of Vice Chancellors of Open Universities will be established to develop cooperation in areas such as the sharing and joint development of programmes, credit transfers for specific programmes and the translation of existing programmes.<br><br>The Summit stressed the importance of developing a regional self-reliant capability for South Asia in scientific research and development. India will host a special meeting of SAARC Science &amp; Technology Ministers to consider a SAARC Technology Initiative to identify and implement specific regional projects in rural areas which would have a direct impact in improving the day-to-day life of people. SAARC leaders also emphasised the need to institutionalise SAARC cooperation in the field of bio-technology and have directed that cost-effective arrangements for such cooperation should be evolved.<br><br>The Summit has also taken the initiative to develop cooperation in the field of traditional systems of medicine in which the SAARC region has a rich heritage. India will host the First Health Ministers' Conference in 1999 which would help in evolving proposals for cooperation in this field. The Report of the Group of Eminent Persons (GEP) was presented at the Tenth SAARC Summit.

Subregional Cooperation Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Growth Quadrangle (BBIN- GQ) Initiative The Second meeting of Foreign Secretaries of the four countries met in Kathmandu on 17 July, 1998 and finalised Working Modalities for Sub Regional Cooperation. The Growth Quadrangle is to follow a project led approach to cooperation in the core economic sectors of Multimodal Transportation and Communication, Energy, Trade and Investment Facilitation and Promotion, Tourism, Optimal Utilization of Natural Resource Endowments and Environment. These projects would result in tangible benefits to the people in the sub-region in the form of poverty eradication, employment and income generation, social welfare and improvement in the quality of life.<br><br>These projects will be supportive of and complimentary to national plans of the countries in the Growth Quadrangle, to fully utilize their talent and resources as well as mobilize the participation of the private sector in the implementation of projects and activities identified collectively. The projects will develop and make best use of neighborhood synergies and would be such that they can most productively be dealt with on a sub-regional basis. The resources and expertise within the sub-region will be given priority and used to the maximum extent possible with resort to international resources and agencies depending on the requirements of specific projects and availability of internal resources. A prioritized, practical, action-oriented, time-bound and incremental approach will be followed in selection, development and implementation of projects having immediate impact as well as large infrastructure projects with long gestation.<br><br>A three-phase plan of action involving conceptualization of specific projects in the first phase, preparation of feasibility studies and financial estimates in the second phase and implementation of projects and schemes as and when they are ready in the third phase has been agreed upon.

The closeness of relationship was reflected in the exchange of visits with these countries, including visit of H.R.H. Crown Prince of Thailand to India and holding of Joint Commission Meetings with Laos and Vietnam. Total bilateral trade with ASEAN countries in 1997-98 was US$ 5.98 billion compared to US$ 5.99 billion in 1996-97. The marginal decline in bilateral trade can be largely attributed to the fall in the value of the currencies of ASEAN countries and contraction in imports from India. The economic difficulties facing these countries have posed new challenges and we offered to cooperate with these countries in finding ways and means to ensure that the crisis does not adversely impact on our economic &amp; commercial relations.<br><br>Our ties with ASEAN have been developing satisfactorily since India became a Full Dialogue Partner of the ASEAN in 1996. The ASEAN India Joint Cooperation Committee Meeting held in New Delhi in April 1998 provided important mechanisms for implementing various decisions. India has a fundamental interest in the regional security issues as we share maritime boundaries with several ASEAN countries and land and maritime boundary with Myanmar. India sought to promote wider and deeper contact with ASEAN countries in the ASEAN and ARF framework to promote peace development and security in the region. Shri Jaswant Singh, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission and a special envoy of PM led the Indian delegation to the 31st ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) and the 5th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meetings held in Manila in July 1998. The ARF Meeting was significant for India as it was the first time after our nuclear tests that all nuclear weapons States were interacting in a security related forum. The meetings provided opportunities for important bilateral interactions with ASEAN and ARF members.<br><br>Following our nuclear tests in May last year, Australia had taken several measures including ban on visits to India of Ministers and senior officials and suspension of defence cooperation and non-humanitarian aid. In response to the Australian measures Indian Government took reciprocal actions. The Australian government in December, 1998 decided to relax the suspension on Ministerial and senior officials' visits, but the other restrictions remained in place. The Australian Government has recently been trying to start official contacts at high level. Australian deputy PM and Minister of Trade Tim Fisher is scheduled to visit India from February 25-27, 1999 to co-chair the Joint Ministerial Commission Meeting with Commerce Minister.<br><br>Cambodia After months of infighting and violent incidents, general elections were held in Cambodia on July 26 to elect a 122 member National Assembly. These elections were the first since a UN-organised vote in 1993 which followed years of war and political upheaval. In the five years since that poll, Cambodia witnessed further violence and bloodshed. The National Election Committee of Cambodia declared the poll results on 1 September showing that the Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP) led by Hun Sen had won 64 seats, followed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC with 43 seats and the SAM RAINSY's party with 15 seats. At a summit held on 12 &amp;13 November, under the auspices of King Norodom Sihanouk, the CPP and the Funcinpec reached an agreement, to form Cambodia's next coalition government ending a deadlock of almost three months since the declaration of the results. In accordance with the deal, Mr Hun Sen was appointed as the sole Prime Minister; Prince Ranariddh as the President of the National Assembly and Mr Chea Sim, President of CPP becoming the Chairman of a newly created Senate.<br><br>India maintained friendly and close relations with Cambodia. On Cambodian Government's request, a team of five officials led by Shri Sayan Chatterjee, Deputy Election Commissioner from the Election Commission was deputed to Cambodia from 19-29 July as Observers to observe the elections. Bilateral trade during 1997-98 amounted to Rs. 10.3 crores. India donated medicines worth Rs. Five lakhs for humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced persons in Cambodia. As part of the Celebrations of the 50th Anniversary of India's Independence a Photo Exhibition was organised in July 1998 and Leela Samson's Group gave two dance performances. General Ke Kim Yan, Chief of General Staff, Ministry of Defence of Cambodia led a 3-member delegation for participation in the AeroIndia '98 at Bangalore from 6-14 December, 1998.<br><br>The UN General Assembly, on the recommendations of the Credentials Committee decided (December 7) to give Cambodia's seat in the UN to the new coalition government after keeping it vacant for fifteen months. At the 6th ASEAN Summit held in Hanoi on 15-16 December, 1998, it was decided to admit Cambodia as the ASEAN's tenth member at a special admission ceremony to be organised in Hanoi on a subsequent date.<br><br>Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) India's relations with Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) continued to be close and cordial with Laos showing considerable understanding on matters of importance to India.

Conclusion Africa is in a phase of transition, leaving behind the legacies of the past, and moving towards a many-splendoured future embracing democracy, economic reform and a constructive emergence of regional identities. India, with its unique developmental experience, and as the world's largest democracy undergoing significant economic reform, has a vital role to play in underpinning and moulding such an African future. The people of Indian origin who have made Africa their home in almost every corner of the continent are a natural bridge in re-enforcing our future ties with Africa. However, India's diplomatic vision extends beyond such natural ethnic affinities to embrace the interests of Africa as a whole, particularly in the priority area of economic progress and development. Such an economic congruence is facilitated by a broad agreement between India and the countries of Africa on their vision of a new world order characterised by peace, justice and equity, and fully responsive to the needs and interests of the developing world. uu<br><br>MAURITIUS NAMIBIA SOUTH AFRICA USA INDIA KENYA MALI UGANDA RWANDA ETHIOPIA SEYCHELLES CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MADAGASCAR TANZANIA CONGO ZIMBABWE ZAMBIA BOTSWANA NIGER NIGERIA SENEGAL BURKINA FASO COTE D'IVOIRE GHANA ERITREA DJIBOUTI LESOTHO ANGOLAGUINEA GUINEA-BISSAU SIERRA LEONE GABON THE GAMBIA</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>1999</th></tr><tr><td>Europe<br><br>Eastern Europe Section 1 India's traditionally warm, friendly and cooperative relations with the Russian Federation and the countries of East and Central Europe continued to develop steadily during the year.

The Netherlands is our sixth largest trading partner in Europe. The Netherlands ranks 8th in terms of overall approved investment in India since 1991.

The UK is also the largest cumulative investor in India with a figure of Pounds Stg 3 billion. The presence of a large community of Indian origin, which has done well economically, strengthens the traditional links between the two countries.<br><br>The UK in its individual capacity and as the then EU Presidency had been initially critical of the nuclear tests conducted by India. Since then bilateral consultations at a high level have helped to place relations on a firmer footing. The Principal Secretary to PM visited UK on 4 &amp; 5 June, 1998, as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister and on 20 &amp; 21 January, 1991.

The finalisation of the Economic and Monetary Union with the adoption of a single currency Euro by 11 member states of the EU from January 1999 has significance for the international financial system as also implications for the attempts to forge a "European identity" in international affairs. The EU is working on plans for an eastward expansion and there is a serious discussion on the need for its internal financial reforms. There have been moves towards initiating a discussion on NATO's nuclear doctrine and the scope and mandate of its activities, even as it prepares to accept three new members from 1999, its 50th anniversary year. The forthcoming NATO Summit to be held in Washington in April 1999 is expected to consider a New Strategic Concept for the organization which may go beyond the defence of the territories of member countries. These developments impact on the evolving security architecture in Europe and have implications for the security around that region.<br><br>The EU, with its fifteen member countries is the largest economic entity in the world today. It is India's largest trade partner with an annual bilateral trade of over US $ 21 billion in 1997. It is also India's second largest source of approved foreign investment (over Rs 300 billion during 1991-August 1998) and an important partner in technology cooperation.<br><br>The 11th Round of annual India-EU Ministerial level talks was held in New Delhi on 13 November, 1998.

In the early part of the year, there was continuation of a broad based dialogue which both countries had agreed upon. In that context, US Permanent Representative to UN, Bill Richardson headed a delegation to India from April 14-15, 1998. The Indian and the US side had useful exchanges of views on a number of important international, bilateral and regional issues.<br><br>Following India's nuclear tests, the US reaction was extremely critical and negative. The reaction was made up of several elements including what the United States saw as a challenge to the non-proliferation regime which the United States and other nuclear-weapon states have south to put in place to preserve their monopoly of nuclear weapons. It also contained elements of frustration at US inability to detect the tests in advance. India look every opportunity to respond to such statements wherever necessary.<br><br>The US also took the initiative in meetings of the P-5 and G-8 to orchestrate condemnation of the nuclear tests. Many of these countries, however, did not go along with attempts to multilateralise the imposition of restrictive economic measures against India.<br><br>Since then, the reaction has toned down and, to some extent, moderated, This has been reflected in more balanced coverage in the US media. There have been a number of articles and statements from eminent US political personalities and strategic analysts which reflect a better understanding of India's security concerns. There has also been considerable debate in the United States regarding the effectiveness of the coercive economic measures called "sanctions".<br><br>Despite development of the strains in the bilateral relationship, the visits of prominent US political representative continued. US Senators Sam Brownback and Charles Robb, visited India from June 26-30. On their return to the US, these Senators introduced an Amendment to provide authority to the President to waive for up to one year some of the economic measures under Glenn Amendment. In July 1998, US Congress passed an amendment which was called "Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998" which exempted finance and credit guarantees for agricultural commodities, medicine and fertilisers from the purview of 1994.<br><br>After the nuclear tests and the apprehensions expressed in several countries, it was decided to have a more intensive dialogue with the United States. Shri Jaswant Singh, then Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission and Mr Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State have been designated as Representatives to conduct this dialogue.<br><br>The talks are being conducted on the basis of the comprehensive proposals that India has put forward on disarmament and non-proliferation matters, our unilateral moratorium on explosive nuclear tests, willingness to discuss converting this moratorium into a de jure obligation, our offer to enter into constructive negotiations on the FMCT and reaffirming our policies on stringent control on export of sensitive technologies.<br><br>The talks have focussed on issues related to disarmament and non-proliferation. Both sides have agreed that these issues should be kept distinct from regional issues. After six rounds of discussions the talks have narrowed down four issues. These are the CTBT, the FMCT, Export Controls and Defence Posture. On Export Control Issues an expert level meeting was also held in New Delhi on 9-10 November, 1998. The meeting was deemed helpful by both India and the US to the prospects of continuing cooperation in this area. Both sides have agreed to meet in 2nd half of January 1999 in New Delhi to carry forward this dialogue.<br><br>The US has recently announced a partial lifting of the restrictive measures imposed against India. These relate to EXIM, OPIC, TDA Financing and Military Training. The US has stated that these measures are being lifted in recognition of the progress made in the bilateral dialogue. It is however noted that non- basic human needs financing from multilateral financial institutions is still subject to US restrictions. India regards these coercive and restrictive measures as unjustified and counter-productive which should be lifted.<br><br>The US has also issued a list of Indian Government Organisations, Research Institutions, PSUs and Private Companies, which will be subject to export restrictions. This step is with clearly punitive intent. India has made it clear to the US that such measures will be regarded as adverse developments in our relations and will not be conducive to the ongoing dialogue. These aspects were reiterated strongly at the last round of discussions held on 19-20 November, 1998. So far there has been no change in the US position. India will continue to take up this matter in bilateral discussions and is also examining the feasibility of multilateral options, such as consistency with WTO provisions. US Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott visited India from January 29 to February 1, 1999 with an 8-member delegation including the Vice-Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Ralston for the 8th round of Indo-US talks. Discussions between the Indian and US delegations were held on January 29, 30 and 31. The Indian side was led by Shri Jaswant Singh, External Affairs Minister.<br><br>During the talks, the security perspectives of the two sides were further elaborated and clarified and proposals for harmonising these perspectives were explored. Both delegations were satisfied with the outcome of these talks and believed that progress was made in some of the subjects under discussions. Both sides are determined to create a positive atmosphere for advancing the bilateral relations. Indian and US expert level teams will meet in March for follow-up talks on export controls. The two sides have agreed to remain in close contact.<br><br>The next round of the dialogue is envisioned towards the middle of the year, the dates and the venue of the same would be determined in consultations between the two sides.<br><br>Canada The Governor General of Canada, Romeo LeBlanc and Mrs LeBlanc, accompanied by Canadian Revenue Minister, Herb Dhaliwal, paid a State visit to India from March 26 to April 1, 1998. It was the first ever visit by a Governor General of Canada to India specifically undertaken in the context of the 50th Anniversary celebrations of India's independence.<br><br>Canada reacted very adversely to India's nuclear tests in May 1998, and unilaterally restricted government contact. The Canadian position contained a number of elements which were totally unacceptable to India. Canada also placed restrictions on assistance under CIDA. Subsequently, Canada informed that all ongoing projects would continue to receive funding and that new projects of a basic needs nature could be taken up.<br><br>The Canadian Leader of the Opposition, Mr Preston Manning visited India in July- August, 1998. He observed that although Canada did not agree with India's nuclear tests, that was no reason for lack of dialogue, and that India and Canada should be able to talk over differences as friends. There is little change in the official Canadian position so far. Government of India will conduct its relations with Canada in a reciprocal basis. Finance Minister visited Canada in September 1998, for the Commonwealth Finance Minister's meeting.<br><br>Trade between India and Canada continued to flourish. Last year, Indian exports to Canada registered an increase of nearly 23% .

Presently India maintains 13 Resident Missions and 1 post in the region. India's interaction and collaboration with these countries is close both in the bilateral context and in multilateral fora. 11 countries from the region maintain Resident Diplomatic Missions in New Delhi, Uruguay being the latest to open their Mission in November 1998. Guyana is also considering opening of a Resident Mission in New Delhi.<br><br>Interaction with the countries of the region is conducted through bilateral consultative mechanisms. Presently we have such agreements with 9 countries. High level visits complemented by bilateral and official visits have further cemented our relations with the region. In the economic field, realising the potential of the region a concerted effort has been made to diversify and enhance bilateral cooperation. Similar economic reforms in most of the countries in the region have facilitated mutually beneficial cooperation. There have been an increased number of visits of official and private business delegations to and from the region. India has trade and economic agreements with 7 countries of the region and set up Joint Business Councils with some other countries. In continuation of the FOCUS LAC Programme, exclusive Indian exhibitions have helped the dissemination of information on the opportunities available for mutual beneficial economic interaction. Due to concerted efforts trade between India and the LAC region in 1997-98 has grown to over US $ 1.3 billion.<br><br>In the field of culture India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region. Some of the countries like Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad &amp; Tobago have a substantial percentage of people of Indian origin. The region also has also more than 500 institutions, schools, libraries and streets named after Indian leaders. At the institutional level there are cultural agreements and Cultural Exchange Programmes with governments that provide the framework for meaningful interactions between artistes, academicians and scholars.

Whereas the global economy had recorded a modest growth of 3% per annum during the period 1994-97, it became widely apparent in 1998 that world economy may be hurtling towards economic contraction and a phase of intense instability. The recent but persistent financial crisis, which first hit East and South East Asia in 1997 and later showed its contagion effect in Russia, Latin America and even US and Europe, had shaken the world out of complacency. Recessionary trends in Japan further compounded the depressing economic and business scenario prevailing in the world today. As the recession spread, the investors shied away from the emerging economies. Even relatively insulated economies such as India and China felt its adverse impact. These events only proved how the economies all over the globe had become inter-linked in an era of globalisation.<br><br>The direct impact of these developments on India had been somewhat limited last year. However, since the beginning of 1998, it became apparent that the crisis in these regions had been more deep-rooted than expected. Following four years of impressive performance, India's industrial and export growth started turning sluggish since 1997-98. Notwithstanding the increasing strains and dampening effect on India's external trade sector, macro-economic fundamentals of Indian economy remained strong. Against this setting, ensuring India's economic security and maintaining the momentum gained in Indian export expansion, FDI and FII inflows, technology transfers and that the confidence in the Indian economy was not eroded, was the major challenge confronting the economic diplomacy of India.<br><br>A key role that the Economic Division has been entrusted with and which it has been playing vigorously is the promotion of India's economic and commercial interests. The Economic Division interacted intensively with various Ministries, apex chambers of commerce and industry, business organisations, trade promotion councils &amp; agencies and the business community to evolve strategies and contribute to promotion of trade and investment. The Division was associated with a number of economic policy making bodies, both inter-ministerial and public sector undertaking and industry associations. In particular, Economic Division represented MEA on the boards of EXIM Bank, Indian Trade Promotion Organisation, Empowered Committee of Oil and Natural Gas Commission-Videsh Limited, Special Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on Indian Investments Abroad, RITES, WAPCOS, Overseas Construction Council of India, National Centre for Trade Information, etc. This enabled the Ministry to provide not only the political inputs and MEA's thinking on various subjects but also the regional and global perspectives on various policy issues which have a bearing on the economic interests of India. Having been closely associated with the policy making aspects of trade reforms and liberalisations, streamlining of procedures for promotion of Indian exports and Indian investments overseas, analytical inputs were provided to the nodal ministeries.<br><br>Another key role that the Economic Division undertook was to provide a standard backstopping arrangements and a nodal point for addressing the concerns of Indian exporters and industry by providing and seeking timely inputs to and from our Missions. Keeping in view the crucial importance of information dissemination and providing value added information, the Economic Division continued to provide a backup support and information wherewithal to our Missions abroad to enable them to carry out their economic and commercial functions effectively. The Economic Division continued to update its information base on the Indian economy, evolution of trade, economic and investment policies, database of Indian exporters, opportunities for Indian exporters abroad and technology-related aspects by liaising with concerned Government departments and trade information networks in India. Thus the Division could respond effectively and in a timely manner to various economic and commercial queries from the exporters and our Missions abroad. The Indian Missions were also advised from time to time to upgrade their databases and establish connectivity to online databases, develop promotional strategies and undertake large scale information dissemination campaigns regularly so that India's economic policies and concomitant opportunities reached out to the largest cross-section of the local investors and business community. Missions were continuously urged to improve upon their lead response time in addressing the concerns and interests of Indian business and exporting community. While impressing on the Missions to accord highest priority to economic and commercial work, greater emphasis was placed on effectively projecting India's image and building up a global India Brand Equity as a competitive economy as well as in a number of niche products, both traditional and non-traditional including financial services and Information Technology sectors so that a major export thrust could be achieved.<br><br>Being the export-promotion cell of the Ministry, the Economic Division interacted and rendered inputs and assistance in trade promotion efforts of Government agencies and industry associations in order to evolve a pragmatic approach towards our export promotion efforts and further improvements in our trade promotion strategies. The Division assisted in the efforts of various organisations in promoting the participation of foreign business organisations in Indian trade fairs and Indian business in foreign trade fairs, sector- specific seminars, road shows, buyer-seller meets etc. The Division also provided assistance in facilitating contacts between Indian businessmen and their counterparts in major target countries and where required in match making and joint ventures, penetrating new markets, marketing and trade promotion activities etc. Economic Division was actively associated with the "Made in India" show in South Africa and FICCI/CII exhibition in Oman, which were specifically aimed at showcasing India's achievements, strengths and potential and promoting Indian brand image abroad. The Division facilitated through contact with foreign Missions in India and Indian Missions abroad and in collaboration with apex chambers the visits of business delegations to and from India. The Indian industry and business community was increasingly associated in various events of G-15, IOR-ARC, BIMST-EC so that eventually there are trade and investment spin offs for India. The Division circulated wide range of useful information from time to time to apex business chambers and our missions abroad. The Division also received a number of trade complaints both from Indian and foreign companies which were promptly attended to in consultation with our Missions and concerned agencies including DGFT.<br><br>The Economic Division was involved in processing more than 150 proposals for setting up joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries relating to Indian investments overseas involving over US$ 250 million. Similarly the information on foreign investment regulation from various countries were procured and analysed in order to advise other concerned ministries on the viability of incorporating relevant and competitive aspects in our own policies. Another important work of the Economic Division was its increasing and active involvement in work relating WTO. The Division provided inputs on a large number of trade related subjects to influence and purse the issues of interest to India. The Economic Division was actively associated in providing inputs and international perspective as well as political economic assessments in deliberations of various joint business councils and joint commission/committees.<br><br>The Economic Division has been actively contributing to crisis management as well as damage containment and damage prevention on a number of market access and trade related problems and issues affecting India's exports and imports. Emerging patterns with regard to regional groupings, free trade areas, trade blocs, market access related issues and use of restrictive and protectionist policies by various countries which have an impact on the Indian exports were monitored closely and strategies devised to best cope with non-tariff and technical barriers of various kinds. For instance EU has emerged as the largest user of trade protection instruments during the last 2-3 years on imports from India. In particular Indian textiles, steel products, engineering goods and pharmaceuticals have been subjected to around 25 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. Some of the items like unbleached cotton fabric, bed-linen, synthetic fiber ropes had been repeatedly targeted. The defence of such actions called for elaborate steps and extensive lobbying efforts.<br><br>The Economic Division actively participated in coordinating efforts of the concerned Ministries, Export Promotion Councils, Trade Associations, Indian Missions abroad to take up the issues at appropriate fora to safeguard the interests of Indian industry. As a result of this coordinated action, EU's anti-dumping case on imports of unbleached cotton fabric from India ended satisfactorily without imposition of any definitive duties. Economic Division was also actively involved in monitoring and analysing the impact of economic sanctions imposed by certain countries after the nuclear tests by India. With regard to child labour issue which is increasingly being used for protectionist purposes, the Economic Division continued in its efforts to project the problem in its right perspective and to dispel the misconceptions and skewed impressions propagated by various vested interests in our major export markets. In another case involving grant of patent by US Patent and Trade Mark Office to an American company on basmati rice, the Economic Division actively participated in an inter-organisational exercise to prevent misappropriation of indigenous biogenetic resources of India by other countries.<br><br>Apart from the economic and trade-related activities, the Economic Division also processed the Government of India's nominations for various courses and training programmes offered by Singapore under the Colombo Plan and Thailand and Indonesia under the Technical and Cooperation among Developing Countries. Multilateral Economic Relations Introduction The world found itself in a difficult and uncertain economic environment during the year. What had started off as a liquidity crisis in Thailand in mid-1997 snowballed in 1998 into a loss of investor confidence in emerging markets as a whole, and more specifically in the ASEAN countries, South Korea and in Russia. One country after another experienced a sharp downturn in its stock market and a depreciation of its currency owing to a decline of confidence in the viability of its banks and financial institutions. The vast foreign capital that had made possible the Asian miracle of the 80's and early 90's, began to drain out rapidly.<br><br>Although largely protected from similar capital outflows, the Indian economy suffered on account of declining demand for its goods and services in South-East and East Asia, Russia and in recession-struck Japan. But despite the uncertain market conditions, Indian exports sustained their growth in the US and other select developed markets, and that in the face of increasingly competition. India's resilience gives us the confidence that Indian industry will be well- positioned to take advantage of the global recovery when it begins. Today, governments are being called upon to have a more active economic agenda. The World Development Report of 1997 says that development requires an effective State, one that plays a catalytic, facilitating role, encouraging and complementing the activities of private. Businesses and individuals. The reform agenda is hence not just one of liberalisation and a greater reliance on market forces. It is as importantly a redefinition of the government's economic role and responsibilities. Driven by globalisation, rapid diffusion of new technologies, and multilateral harmonisation of international economic activity, there are changes continuously taking place in global trade and investment, with both government and business having to respond.<br><br>The Ministry has accordingly made use of its vantage position by its outreach with economic agencies both within and outside the country, and thus has been a conduit for the flow of information. Our work with economic ministries and state governments as well with trade and industry associations helped our embassies abroad to project the range of opportunities for foreign investors in India. We have tried to play the role of an informed and committed intermediary helping to interpret the expectations that India and the outside world have of each other. Our effort has been to interpret change, identify opportunities and anticipate challenges for our industries and companies. Our objective has been to balance the country's self interest with obligations deriving from our participation in the larger international economic community. Our work, therefore, has been an integral part of India's collective endeavour for commercial and economic development and for a greater Indian presence in the world markets.<br><br>Multilateral Economic Relations Division In the light of these parameters, Multilateral Economic Relations (MER) Division has pursued promotion of India's relations with international multilateral economic organisations and regional, sub-regional and supra-regional economic and trade groupings. Given the emerging importance of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Ministry was actively involved in trade policy-making in GOI and in negotiations on various trade issues. WTO issues are an integral and intrinsic part of international relations and impact on our overall economic and political relations with other WTO member countries. Accordingly, important multilateral developments which have a bearing on global trade and commerce, are regularly analysed and monitored. Inputs on various trade policy issues like Investment, Competition Policy, Government Procurement, Intellectual Property Rights, etc. are duly conveyed to concerned GOI Ministries from time to time. Besides theoretical analysis, MEA was also represented at important events like the Second WTO Ministerial Conference at Geneva to ensure that it keeps abreast of the nuances involved in the WTO multilateral negotiations.<br><br>India's Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN saw many positive developments this year. The Second Meeting of the ASEAN-India Joint Cooperation Committee (AIJCC) was held at Singapore on April 28-29, 1998. India reaffirmed its solidarity with ASEAN in the wake of the financial crisis plaguing the region. Measures outlined by India in this context included Government-to-Government Credit, Exim Bank credit for trade finance, facilities for counter trade, EXIM Bank credit finance for outward and inward investment to and from South-East Asia, feasibility study and consultancy financing by EXIM Bank for infrastructure projects, guarantees and counter guarantees for trade finance, and enhancement of Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programmes for ASEAN countries.<br><br>As part of the on-going India-ASEAN Cooperation in academic and People-to-People Contacts, the India-ASEAN Lecture Series was initiated in December 1996. As many as five lectures by eminent persons from ASEAN countries were organised between May and August 1998. These included Dr Thaksin Shinawatra, former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr Kavi Chongkittavorn, Executive Editor of "The Nation" (Bangkok), Dr J Soedradjad Djiwandono, former Governor of Central Bank of Indonesia, and Prof Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore. From the Indian side, eminent Space scientist Prof U R Rao delivered lectures in Malaysia and Dr R A Mashelkar, Director General of CSIR in Thailand.<br><br>A large contingent of scientists was deputed to participate in the Fifth ASEAN Science and Technology Week (FASTW) and Exhibition held at Hanoi, Vietnam from October 12-15, 1998. Besides taking part in the deliberations, the scientists made focussed presentations on the scientific and technological strides made by India. India also put up a stall at the Exhibition where its strengths in Information Technology, Remote Sensing, Advanced Materials, Biotechnology and India's vision 2020 were highlighted.<br><br>An India-ASEAN Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Partenariat was organised by FICCI from November 10-11, 1998. The Partenariat was designed to facilitate business linkages amongst Indian and ASEAN SMEs by providing them an opportunity to interact closely and to apprise themselves of mutual strengths and complementarities. In all, 27 SME companies from ASEAN and nearly 200 representatives from Indian companies, participated in this event.<br><br>The nascent regional grouping called Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (BIMST-EC), launched in June, 1997, registered commendable progress. India participated in the BIMST-EC Working Group meetings, to give shape to emerging initiatives for cooperation. The BIMST-EC Economic Ministers' Retreat held on 7 August 1998 at Bangkok. decided that lead countries would coordinate cooperation in the six priority sectors, viz., Trade and Investment (Bangladesh), Technology (India), Transport and Communications (Thailand), Energy (Myanmar), Tourism (Sri Lanka), and Fisheries (Sri Lanka).<br><br>With the Ministry's support and in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism, the Confederation of Indian Industry organised a BIMST-EC Tourism Summit at Calcutta from October 30-31, 1998 which was attended by the Tourism Ministers, senior Tourism Officials and travel trade representatives from BIMST-EC countries. It adopted an Action Plan identifying short, medium and long term measures and policies covering areas such as infrastructure corridors, facilitation and promotion measures, declaration of the Year 2001 as 'Visit BIMST-EC Year', Buddhist Circuit and technical training.<br><br>India also participated in the Second BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting held at Dhaka from December 17-19, 1998. The meeting emphasised the need to take practical initiatives to implement projects in agreed sectors of cooperation. It recommended establishment of multimodal transport linkages, regional cooperation in the energy sector, promotion of tourism and active participation by the private sector for intensifying existing linkages between members. The meeting approved admission of Nepal as an Observer besides evolving general guidelines for admission of new observers and guests. It also outlined future priorities including South-South cooperation, trade facilitation and development of a free trade arrangement enhancing regional complementarities and taking initiatives for making the international economic and trading system more favourable for developing countries.<br><br>As in the past, India adopted an active profile in the context of 'Group of 15'(G-15) activities during the year. It participated in the Eighth G-15 Summit held at Cairo from May 11-13, 1998. The high-level Indian delegation to the Summit was led by the Hon'ble Vice-President. The Summit focussed on two major themes, viz., developments in international financial markets; and developments in the Multilateral Trading System and enhancement of intra-G-15 Cooperation in trade and investment. The Summit examined different perspectives and called for comprehensive and urgent action on preventing the spread of the financial turmoil in East and South East Asia. On the issue of the multilateral trading system, the Summit focussed on evolving common (developing) country positions on various matters to be taken up at the Second WTO Ministerial Conference at Geneva in May 1998, as well as on facilitating a positive agenda for developing countries.<br><br>Apart from providing an Indian perspective to the two main themes of the Summit, the Indian delegation also played a major role in focussing Summit discussions on issues like terrorism and bio-diversity. On WTO issues, India emphasized that the pursuit of liberalisation which has become WTO's raison d'etre, was not an end in itself and should meet the core objectives of rapid development, welfare gains and best returns for the extant and potential resources of developing countries. Towards this end, India submitted proposals outlining developing countries' concerns and possible ways of ensuring special and differential treatment to developing countries in all aspects of the WTO agenda and its implementation.<br><br>An MOU on Small Scale Industries Cooperation was concluded between India and Egypt under the framework of the SSI Cooperation Project. The business cooperation pursued in parallel with the Summit included the setting up of a G- 15 Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. A composite Indian business delegation from the apex Chambers participated in the business workshop. India also exhibited a cross-section of its products under the theme "Modern India" at the G-15 Business Exhibition.<br><br>In pursuance of its commitment at the Cairo Summit, India hosted a G-15 Symposium on 'Specialand Differential Provisions for Developing and Least Developed Countries in the Uruguay Round Agreements' in New Delhi from November 10-11, 1998. The Symposium reiterated that the commitments made in the Uruguay Round Agreements must be fulfilled. The deliberations revealed that there was a common approach with regard to strengthening of certain concessions inherent in the WTO Agreement in the areas of longer transition periods, larger threshold limits, reorientation of 'best endeavour' clauses, linking of S&amp;D treatment to development parameters, improvement of market access for developing countries through S&amp;D provisions, transfer of technology, technical assistance and cooperation.<br><br>India also participated in the Ninth G-15 Summit held at Montego Bay, Jamaica from 10-12 February 1999. Hon'ble Prime Minister led the Indian delegation to the Summit. The G-15 Summit Meetings deliberated extensively on issues of concern to developing countries. These included discussions on the current international economic situation including the need for an international consultative process in respect of capital flows, reaffirmation of the importance of a transparent, fair and equitable rules-based multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organisation, reform of the international financial architecture, South-South and intra G-15 cooperation and prospects of undertaking a G-15 - G-8 dialogue in these matters.<br><br>All such priorities were duly reflected in the Joint Communique issued at the end of the Ninth Summit. In order to be able to cope with challenges posed by globalisation and economic liberalisation and the ongoing financial crisis, members agreed to promote convergence of viewpoints on these issues. They also called for enhanced regional and international cooperation to combat the menace of terrorism. India's offer to host a G-15 meeting at an appropriate level in preparation for the Third WTO International Conference was welcomed by the participants at the Ninth G-15 Summit. They also endorsed India's proposal which suggested adoption of a strategic sectors approach towards South-South cooperation focussing on core areas like bio-technology, information technology and infrastructure development.<br><br>India also took active interest in the programmes of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). It participated in a major Indian Ocean Rim Trade Exhibition organised in Oman (Muscat) from October 10-14, 1998. India also participated in the First Meeting of Experts on Standards &amp; Accreditation from November 9-11, 1998 in Colombo. A high-level delegation was deputed to participate in the First IOR-ARC Senior Trade Policy Officials Meeting held at Perth ( Australia) from December 7-8, 1998. The Second Ministerial Meeting of IOR-ARC is scheduled to take place in Maputo (Mozambique) in March 1999. A high-level Indian delegation is expected to participate in the meeting. A Seminar on Trade and Investment in IOR-ARC countries, which will be coordinated by the IOR-ARC Chair in the University of Mauritius, is planned to be held alongside the meeting.<br><br>India is an active member of the 'Group of 77' and participated in the Annual Ministerial Meeting held at New York on 25 September, 1998 which was held against the backdrop of a global financial crisis and prospects of an economic recession. India has taken initiatives on (a) sensitisation and consciousness raising on the gravity of problems and on the systemic crises that need to be highlighted besides highlighting opportunities presented by the situation for developing countries (b) getting developing countries to focus on key issues that they need to stress and negotiate with the developed countries in the financial, monetary and trading system, (c) drawing attention of the North to the key concept of international public good rather than just market forces being an important determinant of international economic policy and order, (d) bringing back the focus on concessional financial flows, more favourable and relatively unhindered transfer of technology and special and differential treatment in trade to developing countries as part of development cooperation agenda, and (e) establishing synergy and connectivity between this agenda and the new liberalisation and globalisation agenda.<br><br>As a symbol of its solidarity with Africa, India participated in the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-II) which was held in Tokyo from October 19-21, 1998. About 80 countries and 40 international organisations and the UN Secretary General, participated in the event at which the developmental concerns and priorities of African countries received attention. The need to step up the level of developmental assistance and cooperation with African countries was duly recognised by developed countries.<br><br>India's intervention highlighted its special relationship with Africa and commitment to deeper economic cooperation as well as ongoing technical assistance projects in Africa. It recommended adoption of triangular cooperation involving developed countries or international organisations along with the technical expertise of a developing country for projects in Africa. In keeping with its commitment at the South-South Conference on Trade, Finance and Investment held in San Jose (Costa Rica) in January 1997, India hosted a "G- 77 Trade Fair and Trade Conference" in New Delhi in November 1998. The objective was to enhance South-South Cooperation by providing an opportunity for developing business contacts and networking amongst the G-77 countries, and also to create greater awareness for enhancing business opportunities by utilising the vast trade, economic and business potential existing in the South. A New Delhi Declaration setting the agenda for Trade and Investment cooperation for G- 77 was adopted.<br><br>With the developed world's think-tank and policy consultation body, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), India continued to develop a policy dialogue relationship. It participated in OECD's outreach programmes for Dynamic Non-Member Economies (DNMEs) by deputing experts to attend the OECD Seminars/Workshops on Steel Trade Issues, Benefits of Trade and Investment Liberalisation, Practical Application of Tax Treaties, Agricultural Policies, etc.<br><br>Technical Cooperation The Technical Cooperation Division administers bilateral assistance on a Government to Government basis to 130 developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. While most countries in the world either give or receive technical assistance, India is unique in both receiving and giving technical assistance in a major way, the latter through two programmes conducted by TC Division, the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan (SCAAP) programme. In this Report, reference to ITEC will also include SCAAP as the two programmes are different only in the budget heads under which accounts are maintained.<br><br>The ITEC Programme has four major components:<br><br>(1)Training (both Civil and Military)<br><br>(2)Projects, including feasibility studies and consultancy services<br><br>(3)Deputation of Experts and<br><br>(4)Study Tours for foreign decision-makers to India. In regard to Civilian Training, 1485 slots were provided under ITEC during this year in 39 prestigious Training Institutions and Establishments (Appendix - XIII) of which 1326 slots were utilised (lists at Appendices - XIV-XV). These slots were for training in various types of courses such as Audit and Accounts, Banking, Diplomacy, Manpower Planning, Parliamentary Studies, Poultry, Rural Development, Small Scale Industries, Computers and Software, Maintenance of Biomedical Equipment, Food Processing Technology etc. During the year, a new subject "English Language for Professional Purposes" was introduced into the Programme and courses in various S&amp;T fields were conducted for Vietnam and Cuba under special Agreements.<br><br>A special training course was conducted for 25 Zimbabwean Police Officers in computer software. The wife of the Prime Minister of Senegal Mrs Silvie Aicha Loum was trained at the Fragrance and Flavour Development Centre, Kannauj and KVIC, New Delhi on production of Agarbatti and Dhoop Batti to enable her to organize Dhoop production centres for unemployed women in Senegal, using locally grown raw materials. Training slot offers to Iraqi nationals under sanction-affected Iraq were increased from 35 to 50 in the current financial year. These offers cover many fields such as agriculture, water management, desert cropping, genetic engineering, tyre industry, telecommunications and several others.<br><br>The assistance offered under ITEC is a fully self-contained package inclusive of international air passages, boarding, lodging and training costs etc. Currently, India bears an average cost of Rs.1.25 lakhs on each foreign participant under the ITEC Programme which has benefited over 10,000 nominees of foreign Governments since its inception in 1964. Demands for our training programmes are growing as during 1998-99, 1326 nominees were trained which is the highest number as compared to 1995-96 (970 nominees), 1996-97 (1001 nominees) and 1997- 98 (1031 nominees).<br><br>Every year ITEC Day is celebrated by the Indian Missions abroad on 15th September. This year the event was also celebrated at Headquarters after a gap of 5 years. The event was attended by about 350 guests consisting of Heads of Diplomatic Missions/other Diplomats of more than 60 countries who are recipients of ITEC assistance, high-level Government officials, representatives of various Training Institutes, media personnel and about 100 trainees both civilian and military trainees who were at that time undergoing training at various Institutes located at New Delhi. The gathering was addressed by the Foreign Secretary who spoke about various activities being undertaken under ITEC Programme and its future orientation. This was followed by a cultural programme presented by candidates from Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Mauritius, Uganda.<br><br>On December 14-15, 1998, a Conference of the Training Institutes empanelled under ITEC was convened at New Delhi under the Chairmanship of Secretary (ER) Shri S T Devare and addressed by AS (FA) Shri B N Jha. The Conference was the first of its kind organized by the Ministry of External Affairs and was considered timely in view of the growing potential which training and capacity building activities for promoting India's bilateral relations with the developing countries. The Conference was also useful to discuss problems of coordination between our Diplomatic Missions, the Training Institutes and TC Division and many suggestions for procedural improvements emerged from it. There was a consensus that India can be more effectively projected through the ITEC programme as an important training destination for developing countries by streamlining the effectiveness of performance at these three levels. Training Institutes, appreciating the leverage which, having an international profile, can give them to generate important commercial spin-off benefits for themselves, and by extension for the country, were urged to improve their performance under ITEC accordingly.<br><br>Military Training is another important task undertaken under ITEC Programme. TC Division is a nodal point for organizing Military Training for nominees of friendly foreign Governments in some of the more prestigious Defence institutions of India such as Indian Military Academy, National Defence College, Defence Service Staff College etc. During this year approximately 198 slots for long and short term training courses were offered under ITEC and approximately 237 slots under Self-Financing Schemes. Some slots were also offered on a reciprocal basis. Appendices - XVI-XIX contain the lists of countries whose candidates were trained under ITEC Programme.<br><br>Another important aspect of the ITEC Programme is project cooperation with partner countries. Such cooperation, extended over many years since ITEC was established in 1964, has enhanced India's image as a country which is generous in sharing her experience and expertise acquired in the past fifty years of her independent existence, with other developing countries. In 1998-99 plans to establish a Plastic Technology Demonstration and Common Facility Centre in a backward region of Namibia by NSIC at a cost Rs. 3.40 crores were finalised, soon after a visit to that country by the Indian Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee. A major project to set up an Entrepreneur and Technical Development Centre (ETDC) at a cost of Rs.13 crores in Dakar (Senegal) launched last year in fulfillment of a G-15 commitment, was executed in considerable measure by HMT (I) despite initial setbacks. The Mini Dairy Plant supplied last year to Kyrghyzstan at a cost of Rs.1.75 crores has gone into production of milk and butter. Plans to send six farmers from Punjab to Burkina Faso for three years to demonstrate Indian agricultural techniques especially for growing rice, were carried further.<br><br>In addition to project assistance, the TC Division supplied equipment for upgradation of the Upadhyay Training Centre in Mauritius, irrigation pumps to Uganda, Ambulances and Incubators to the Indira Gandhi Maternity Clinic in Namibia, diesel pumps and sewing machines to Ivory Coast and textile machinery to Vietnam in 1998-99. A list of projects and project-related assistance extended this year to different countries may be seen at Appendix - XX. As of now, there are 23 experts on long term deputation (from 2 to 3 years) to various countries as advisors in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine, marine engineering, water management, accountancy, fish toxicity, teaching, legislative drafting and in military fields (list is at Appendix - XXI). Seven short-term experts have also been sent to a few countries this year. Over the years, Indian experts have been acknowledged by many developing countries to have done commendable work in building institutional frameworks for self-reliant growth with limited means.<br><br>On the recommendations of Indian Heads of Missions, Study Visits by senior level officers and decision-makers are organized every year by the TC Division from various partner countries. Visits, generally in the areas of small scale industries, agriculture, health and education, trade and commerce etc. are an extremely popular method of introducing foreign visitors to different developmental sectors in the Indian economy and polity as they offer a first- hand exposure to Indian economic conditions. Nine study visits took place in the year under review. These include a visit by Prof Alberto Simao, Chairman, National Institute for Development of Local Industry, Mozambique to see the various industries and R&amp;D centres engaged in improving the quality of products of the small-scale units under the supervision of the DCSSI. A four-member delegation from Nairobi University led by Prof D N Kariuku, Chairman, Department of Chemistry visited various Institutions and chemical industries to learn from Indian experience of the interface between academic training and commercial activity in the field of chemistry.<br><br>Also invited was a three-member delegation from Vietnam headed by Director, Cuu Long Rice Research Institute, Dr Nguyen Van Luat to visit some Agricultural Universities and see some items of agricultural machinery which are manufactured in India. Two more agricultural delegations were invited in response to interest expressed by them in knowing about our Green Revolution - (i) a four-member delegation from Mongolia headed by Mr Y A Balgansuren, Director, Department of Policy Coordination, Ministry of Industry &amp; Agriculture, and (ii) a three-member delegation from Kyrghyzstan headed by Mr Tolobek E Omuraliev, Advisor to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Head of the Department of Local Self Government and Agricultural Policy under the Presidential Administration.<br><br>The visitors were taken to our Agricultural Research &amp; Development Centres in Pusa, Karnal, Shimla, Ludhiana and for discussions with our authorities there. Mr A W Searle, Warden of the Zimbabwe Zoo was invited to interact with the Wildlife Institute in Dehra Dun. Two senior officials from the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation visited India and were shown Doordarshan and AIR facilities with a view to long-term cooperation between India and Namibia in this important sector of information and communication technology. Mr Patrick Mandago, Namibian Chief of Protocol visited to study the functioning of the Protocol Division of the Ministry. Sometimes, a study visit is arranged to acquire expertise from the visitors as was the case when Mr J R Muller, General Manager of a South African Government- owned Company called Abakor came to India to advise the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on improvements in its abattoirs in Delhi and Aligarh, also during this year.<br><br>Under the Aid to Disaster Relief Programme (ADR), TC Division provides humanitarian aid for disaster relief to various countries, in the form of medicines, clothing, food etc. In the current financial year, medicines and foodgrain were sent to Bangladesh for victims of some of the worst floods that the country has known. Afghanistan's earthquake victims were assisted with medicine, blankets, tents and biscuits. Many other countries such as Comoros, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Sudan, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Peru, Tajikistan and Kyrghyzstan received quantities of medicines and other forms of assistance depending upon their expressed requirements. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean affected Hurricanes George and Mitch respectively were also assisted with small quantities of medicines and surgical instruments under the ADR programme. A complete list of the relief supplied by India under this programme in 1998-99 may be seen at Appendix - XXII.

Major thrust areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power, telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment Promotion and Publicity Division to activelyand publicity efforts, particularly throughthe Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missionsare the first point of contact for the foreign investor.<br><br>It is, therefore, essential that the Missions are given full back-up support in their efforts in the form of providing up-to-date information about the economy, the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and opportunitiesavailable in different sectors, the incentives offered by the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these and related matters the Investment Promotion and Publicity (IPP) Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments or other agencies, as the case may be.<br><br>Policy The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever required, based on investment trends world-wide and based on the need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and our economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the Missions on foreign investor perceptions about India's investment policies or about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving as inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national interest.

Economic news about India was regularly disseminated to all the Missions highlighting major policy decisions and new opportunities, thus keeping them abreast of developments. Missions were also encouraged to hold investment promotion seminars and workshops besides extending investment support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of our Missions in identified target countries. Ministry also undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures and opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.<br><br>The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations.

As part of its interactive functions, the Division took the initiative in promoting exchanges with official and non-official visiting experts and projected India's views and perceptions on important issues.<br><br>The Division continued to edit and publish the Annual Report of the Ministry. The Report served as a compendium of India's interaction with the rest of the world in the political, economic and cultural fields, including the views of the government on various facets of international relations. The Division rendered all possible assistance to the territorial divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific information or document on international relations was required. The Research Wing examined the depiction of India's international boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through Indian Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The Division also scrutinised foreign publications containing maps depicting India's external boundaries before these were imported into the county and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such matters. It coordinated the supply of map- sheets to various Government and semi-Government agencies for use in their official work with the Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The Research Wing dealt with requests from research scholars for access to the records of the Ministry.<br><br>In support of research, the Ministry's Library has modern information technology equipment and rich resource materials, with over one hundred thousand books and a large collection of maps, microfilms and official documents. The Library receives and maintains 600 periodical titles. It has in-house computer systems with fifteen terminals, two of which support data entry and retrieval in Hindi.

The Library is also equipped with a Colour Scanner (with OCR capability as well as facility for storage and retrieval of images), a microfilm/fiche reader printer, a plain paper photocopier, as well as a VTR and colour monitor and a laser printer with Desk Top Publishing (DTP) software. This has enabled better presentation of publications and documents of the Division. The Library has internet and E-mail facilities. These are being gradually made availableto visiting users who include former Foreign Service officers.<br><br>Documentation/bibliographic services as well as other library operations and services have been computerised, using an integrated library software package.

It involves the dissemination of news about developments pertaining to India and India's views and concerns on national and international issues. Opinion makers are kept informed about developments in India in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres with particular reference to issues having a bearing on India's external relations and foreign policy. Following the nuclear tests by India in May 1998, this function became dominant and was effectively handled.<br><br>The External Publicity Division and Missions/Posts abroad worked in unison to enlarge areas of positive perception about the country while attempting to build greater awareness and understanding of its policies and values. Some focus areas included: India's millennial history and its civilisation; its diverse and profound religious and philosophical traditions; its democratic and secular political culture and institutions, its pluralistic, tolerant and accommodative social ethos; its wide experience in nation building; its impressive economic, scientific and technological achievements, its colossal market potential and, its strategic perceptions including its evolving nuclear policy. Audio visual and print material was used to achieve these objectives.<br><br>In its key function as the office of the Official Spokesman of the Government of India on all matters pertaining to India's external affairs, the External Publicity Division strove to orient the domestic and international media on a day to day basis on India's foreign policy perspectives and on topical issues, particularly the nuclear policy through regular briefings and public relations efforts. Over 200 Press Releases and Statements were issued by the Division the year, upto November 1998, and distributed amongst Indian and foreign media, Indian missions abroad, foreign missions in India and also made available on the MEA internet website. The 'Foreign Affairs Record', a compilation of all press releases, visits, agreements and significant diplomatic developments, was brought out on a monthly basis. The Division's news dissemination function also included news bulletins sent out to India's Missions/Posts abroad on a twice - daily basis; a newspaper clipping service on external affairs coverage from the national media for Indian Missions and for senior officials of the Ministry; and, news on the Ministry's internet website.<br><br>Eight documentaries were aquired from Surabhi on Education, Art, Music, Dance, Handicrafts, Development and Culture for non-commercial publicity through our Missions/ Posts abroad. Copies of these films were sent to our Missions/ Posts abroad as part of our publicity exercise. Further, documentaries on Progressive Indian Women; India in Space; The North-East; The Changing Face of Indian Countryside; Flute; Confluences in North Indian Music; New Frontiers of Information Era; The Indian Experience; A Nation Celebrates; The Empire Writes Back; The Rooted Imagination; Dreaming Young Dreaming Global; Transition Times; Indian Achievements in Agricultural Sciences and Technology; Buddhist Heritage of Ladakh; The Nuclear Issue; Saarc- 10th Summit in Colombo; Fragrance of Love; Traditional Heritage of India; and, The Victoria Memorial were commissioned and are at various stages of completion. Many documentaries were telecast on local TV networks abroad including The Making of a Nation, A Nation Celebrates, India- Trysts with Destiny, Theatre of India, Magic in the Making, Nauka Caritramu, and 100 Years of Cinema through 40 Missions on the occasion of Independence Day and were well received.

The Star TV and Asianet networks also aired our documentaries.<br><br>CD-ROMs on Desi Khana, Multimedia Journey, India Beckons, Hindi Guru, Mahabharta, India Mystica, India Festiva, Krishna were sent to each Mission/Post abroad. Copies of MEA's CD-ROM "India Timeless Civilisation-Vibrant Democracy" were also sent to all Missions/Posts abroad. 2400 gift sets of two video cassettes of film "Making of a Nation" a ten part series and VHS cassettes in gift packs were sent to all Missions/Posts abroad for presentation purposes. XP Division extended its support and cooperation for festivals organised abroad. These included, inter-alia, Film Festivals in Houston, Tokyo, St.Denis, Copenhagen, Tripoli, Malta, Damascus, and the Eager University Film Festival in Budapest. Indian Film Festivals in 23 other Missions were organised during the golden jubilee celebrations of India's Independence. Further, XP division contributed to 35 other film festivals organised by various missions/posts abroad. Apart from this, the division assisted the Directorate of Film Festivals in organising Film Festivals abroad under its aegis.<br><br>54 prints of eight feature films based on the Freedom Struggle namely: Gandhi, Sardar, Nehru, Garam Hawa, Tamas, 22nd June 1897, Making of the Mahatma and Train to Pakistan were acquired, sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic and sent to missions abroad for film festivals. 175 prints of various feature films in 16/35mm format were sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic languages through NFDC, Mumbai.<br><br>Activity on the Photo Publicity side also increased substantially. Collections of large size photographs were sent to Missions abroad for special photo exhibitions in connection with the 50th anniversary of Indians Independence. On the occasion of the Independence Day, 1500 prints were sent to various missions and posts abroad for special supplements in local newspapers. Cataloging, computerisation and inventor formation of the entire stock of feature films, documentary films, U-Matic/Betacam cassettes, video programmes, photographs and transparencies was completed during the year. Active assistance was provided to our Missions/Posts abroad in promoting their publicity effort by providing them with tourist literature, photographs and pamphlets.<br><br>The foreign media continued to show a keen interest in India through visits by media delegations and TV teams. The entry of India into the 'Nuclear Club' in May 1998, further stimulated incoming media visits. The XP Division provided assistance to them, including briefing them, as well as seeking appointments with senior Ministers, senior officials, academicians, representatives of business houses and chambers of commerce. This Division also invited foreign media persons to facilitate foreign journalists in gaining a first hand experience of India. In 1998, 120 journalists, individually or as part of media and TV delegations, visited India from the Phillipines, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Nepal, Malaysia, Turkey, Pakistan , China, Kenya, Mexico, UAE, USA, Sri Lanka, Senegal, Cyprus, South Africa, Czechlovakia, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco, Kyrgyztan, Uzbekistan, Croatia, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. These visits generated extensive coverage on India in the foreign media and in creating a better understanding of our country.<br><br>Another important job handled by this Division was making media arrangements for delegations accompanying the Heads of State or Government on visits to India. This assistance entailed facilitating media coverage, arranging press briefings and providing other logistical arrangements. During the year, VVIP visits were received from France, Canada, Maldives, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Belarus, Belgium, Chile and Switzerland. Visits from South Africa, Russia, Thailand and Sri Lanka are expected by the end of the year. The XP Division also handled all logistical arrangements for Indian media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and the Prime Minister on their state visits abroad to Peru, Brazil, USA, Nepal, Germany, Luxembourg Portugal, Turkey, Cairo (G-15 Summit), Colombo (SAARC Summit), Durban (NAM Summit), Namibia, Oman, Mauritius, Jamaica (G-15), Trinidad and Tobago and Morocco. The division effectively contributed during these visits by setting up and operating media centres and looking after all logistical arrangements for the Indian media - locally based and travelling with the VVIPs.<br><br>One of the important jobs entrusted to this Division is the clearance of documentary proposals received from documentary makers all over the world. Out of over 360 proposals received, 85 per cent were cleared, while others were awaiting approvals from central and state governments.<br><br>There are more than 300 foreign journalists of various foreign news agencies and organisations based in India. An important aspect of this Division's work has been to provide accreditation facilities and give clearances for renewal of visas to these journalists. With more and more news agencies setting up bureau offices in India, work related to this aspect increased this year, especially following the nuclear tests. A number of new Bureau were opened during the year.<br><br>The supply of books, magazines, journals and other periodicals on a wide range of issues for use in the Missions' libraries and for distribution to local dignitaries abroad, opinion makers and academic institutions continued during the year. Based on the feedback received from various targetted groups, the Division supplied material suitable to their requirements. More than fifty different books were purchased for distribution to our Missions/Posts, including the Booker Prize Winner, "God of Small Things", a highly valued photographic book by Lindsay Hebberd on the Cultural and Socio-economic spectrum of India- "Cultural Portraits", "Indian Experience" on the diverse aspects of India, a foreign publication on India, "India Unveiled", "India 2020: A Vision for new Millennium" by eminent scientist APJ Abdul Kalam, a collection of writings on India by a team of accomplished journalists of international news agencies titled 'Assignment India', and others including some specifically meant for children.<br><br>The two important publications of External Publicity Division in Coffee table book format, viz. "India Continuity in Change" and "India: A Dynamic Democracy", were distributed to our missions abroad. The reprinting of the revised publicaiton "India A Dynamic Democracy" in English was completed and 6000 copies were distributed to our Missions/Posts abroad for publicity purposes. In view of the rising demand, their publication was commissioned in other languages like French, German, Russian, Arabic and Spanish. The Division continued to assist ICCR and UN/ITEC Divisions in the production of their publications.<br><br>Over Fifty five thousand copies of India Perspectives, a prestigious monthly magazine published by the XP Division in ten different languages, were distributed through Indian Missions and Posts abroad. The magazine was also made available on the MEA website to cover a wider audience. Besides highlighting India's historical and cultural heritage, the journal has been focussing on the impressive progress made by India in all facets of life, achievements in the area of Science and Technology and the steps taken to globalise the country's economy. A special issue of this magazine on Nuclear India was brought out in the month of September 1998 to supplement the efforts of projecting India's viewpoint on the nuclear issue.<br><br>The international media was monitored using inputs from Missions abroad. Negative and adverse reports in the international media on India' s nuclear tests were rebutted by the Indian missions through interviews/letters in influential papers and appearances on TV channels as well as other engagements. Compilations of reportage in the international media, on the nuclear and other relevant issues were circulated in the Ministry; to the Indian media; and to Indian Missions abroad. The comments by foreign journalists, political leaders and intellectuals of international repute highlighting India's point of view were circulated widely and also put up on the MEA's internet website.<br><br>Special supplements were brought out in 'The New York Times' and 'The Washington Post' containing commissioned articles on India's nuclear policy by eminent personalities. Missions abroad also brought out supplements in the local papers throughout the world on Independence Day and Republic Day. India's nuclear policy, foreign policy issues, India's economy, culture, science and technology achievements were some of the focus areas. A section on India's nuclear policy was opened on MEA's website after the nuclear tests and this was appreciated by many international agencies and commended by 'The Los Angeles Times', BBC and many others. The fact that information on the Ministry's website at www.indiagov.org and www.meadev.gov.in was well received could be gauged from the 2.2 million hits received by the site per month. Action has been initiated to enhance the role of the website through its technical enhancement as well as substantive enrichment and updating.</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><th>1999</th></tr><tr><td>Protocol<br><br>State Visits by Heads of State / Government/ Vice Presidents/ Crown Prince to India<br><br>1.H.

Apart from constituting a public service, the issue of a passport also has a bearing on a vital component of India's foreign policy viz., the export of Indian manpower, expertise and technology abroad. The large Indian community resident abroad constitutes a dynamic link between India and the rest of the world. In an era in which the international scene has witnessed momentous changes, the people of Indian origin abroad have played a significant role in promoting India's interests and in contributing towards the strengthening of India's political and economic relations with their respective countries of adoption.<br><br>Passport Services Efforts to fulfil the Government's commitments under the Citizens' Charter were taken forward in 1998 through various measures aimed at providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport Offices. A new Passport Office at Pune and three new Passport Collection Centres at Surat, Gangtok and Aurangabad were opened during the year. The Passport Rules were amended to allow for sixty page (Jumbo) passport booklets which is very convenient to frequent travellers in this increasingly globalising world. For less frequent travellers a passport with validity upto 20 years has been introduced.<br><br>Separate passports for minors were also introduced to bring the practice in India in line with that prevalent internationally. This has been done to eliminate the chances of inconvenience to the passport holder when they approach some foreign Missions for visas. Some of the countries which insist on a separate passport for children before giving them visa are USA, UK, Canada, Japan and almost all European countries.<br><br>Special efforts were made to reduce the pendency of applications in various Passport Offices for which standard monitoring procedures were devised and regular inspections of the Passport Offices institutionalised. The Annual Passport Officers Conference was held on 8 October, 1998 at which emphasis was placed on the need to effectively redress public grievances. A review of the Passports Act and Rules was initiated and Passport Officers asked to consider introducing the practice of periodical 'Passport Adalats'.<br><br>Extensive measures have been initiated to simplify and streamline various procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous services promptly and efficiently in keeping with our commitment under the Citizens' Charter. Comprehensive instructions liberalizing grant of duplicate passports were issued to various Passport Issuing Authorities.<br><br>From the mid 80s when the Ministry had first launched a project to computerise a few passport offices in a phased manner, already 15 passport offices including those in the metropolitan cities have been comprehensively computerised. Other passport offices are also in the process of being computerised. A proposal for a comprehensive satellite based computer programming and connectivity as well as the creation of a central Processing Cell is being fromulated. MEA also went through a process of open tendering and bids for completely overhauling the existing system and to take advantage of the latest available technology.<br><br>However, due to certain technicalities the bids had to be returned in September 1998. It was decided thereafter to appoint Department of Electronics as a consultant for preparing a fresh tender document especially with regard to the technical specifications for the project. The report has been received and the tender documents are expected to be finalised and issued shortly. It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house the Passport Offices in Government owned properties. MEA has acquired plots of land/built-up properties in various cities in India to this effect. We have 28 Passport Offices in India of which five Passport Offices at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Cochin and Kozhikode are already operating from Government buildings.<br><br>Construction work is in progress at 6 places viz. Ahmedabad for office and residential complex; Cochin (residential complex), Hyderabad (Office complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji and Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been initiated at another nine places i.e. Banagalore, Chennai, Lucknow, Jaipur, Trivandram, Chandigarh, Trichy, Jammu and Calcutta.<br><br>The number of applications received during the year for grant of passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. continued to rise in keeping with the overall climate of liberalisation and increased travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 22,22,786 fresh passports were issued and 3,08,214 miscellaneous services rendered. Detailed figures of receipts of passports issued/various services rendered including the revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices are at Appendix IV.<br><br>PIO Card The six million Indian citizens and over twenty million People of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have collectively evolved into a major instrument for the furtherance of India's foreign policy. Recognising their significant role in the shaping of the country's destiny, Government announced the introduction of a PIO Card for Persons of Indian Origin settled in countries to be specified by Government which would, besides introducing a visa free regime, also confer some special economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits. A user-friendly software has also been developed which will enable the Indian Missions abroad to compile and maintain a uniform database on the NRIs/PIOs.<br><br>Consular Services As part of the drive towards modernisation of consular services, new secure visa stickers were introduced at all the Indian diplomatic Missions and Posts abroad from 1 August, 1998. In keeping with ICAO recommendations, efforts are continuing to introduce more secure and machine readable passports and visas. There was renewed emphasis on the need to cater to the consular needs of Overseas Indians and to render them efficient and timely assistance through the Indian diplomatic Missions abroad. Problems encountered by Non-Resident Indians/workers especially in the Gulf countries, including disputes with their employers/sponsors were sought to be promptly redressed. Government maintained regular contact with the Governments of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism of the Joint Commission, with the objective of resolving consular problems and ameliorating the condition of Indian workers in those countries.<br><br>In cases of deaths of Indians abroad immediate assistance was arranged by our Missions and Posts for completing the formalities for early despatch of the mortal remains while maintaining liaison with the local and Indian authorities as well as the relatives of the deceased. In several countries various amnesty schemes were announced for regularising the stay of illegal immigrants in those countries. Special drives were launched to cater to the specific requirements of affected Indian nationals by way of expeditious issue of Emergency Certificates/travel documents and other requisite assistance. During the year, 9383 Indians were arrested abroad and 4783 deaths of Indian abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary of the consular data for the year 1998 is at Annexure 'B'.<br><br>Visas India's more than 150 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to over 1.64 million foreigners during 1998. The procedure for grant of visa by our Missions and Posts is user friendly, quick and efficient. Many Missions and Posts give visas either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas within 48 hours. To keep pace with increasing automation, the Consular Wing in HCI London has been computerised which has reduced the time spent by applicants in the queues as well as at the counter. Computerisation has also speeded up the processing of application for visas. The Ministry is actively considering computerisation of some other Consular Wings in North America where the volume of services rendered is high.<br><br>Bilateral Agreements As part of the global endeavour to counter terrorism, and acknowledging the growing international dimensions of crime, consular agreements and institutional mechanisms were negotiated with several countries. These negotiations included over two dozen Extradition Treaties, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties in Criminal and Civil Matters as well as Consular Conventions. During the visit of Russian Prime Minister to India in December, 1998 an Extradition Treaty, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters and Consular Convention were signed. Official and technical level consultations were held with Bulgaria and Tunisia for finalising bilateral Extradition Treaties. While certain issues still remained to be sorted out with Bulgaria, an Extradition Treaty draft has been finalised and initialled with Tunisia on February 9, 1999.<br><br>With France and UAE the Extradition Treaties were initialled. However, as subsequently some changes have been suggested by both sides the two treaties are being further negotiated. The Ministry is currently addressing several requests for extradition and other legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal and civil and commercial charges. The request for extradition emanates from our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or extradition arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year six fresh requests were processed in addition to the ongoing cases.<br><br>During the year, 2,36,120 documents were accorded consular attestation in CPV Division of which 1,47,069 were commercial documents. The same day service rendered is efficient and courteous and without any charge. Renovation of Patiala House CPV Division is located in the Patiala House which is visited by a large number of applicants who come for attestation of documents as well as by diplomats and staff of foreign Missions in New Delhi. Over the years the building had become dilapidated and shabby in appearance. A project for comprehensive renovation of the exterior as well as interior of the building has been undertaken during the year. The work is expected to be completed by the end of March 1999.<br><br>Central Passport Organisation The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) man the 28 passport offices and 12 existing Passport Collection Centres. The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1595 with 145 officers and 1450 non-gazetted staff. During the year the All India Passport Employees Association was recognised by the Government. One of the major demands of the employees is for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review has been formulated during the year and is being processed.<br><br>As the volume of work as well as the network of Passport Offices and Passport Collection Centres has been growing over the years, the Ministry is considering a proposal to create a Central Passport Authority with a view to grant greater autonomy to the Passport Offices to achieve greater efficiency and higher productivity.<br><br>Vision Our goal is to set up a clean, transparent and efficient passport issuing service which the MEA can be justifiably proud of and which the general public can be genuinely satisfied about. The system should also be sensitive and responsive to the special needs of the public. uu<br><br>INDIA USA CANADA UNITED KINGDOM JAPAN PERU CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MALI RUSSIA BULGARIA TUNISIA FRANCE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES<br><br>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report<br><br>1998<br>16<br><br>Administration and Organisation<br>Following the general elections in February/March 1998, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee assumed charge of the office of Prime Minister on March 18, 1998, with the additional charge of the Ministry of External Affairs.

The harshly critical reaction of the US government to India's nuclear tests in May 1998 vitiated the atmosphere of relations. Following India's clarification of the unassailable rationale for our tests, and our well-considered proposals on disarmament and non- proliferation related issues, our actions have begun to be perceived in a better light. The media and the strategic community in US has also indicated a somewhat better appreciation of India's security concerns. In June 1998, the two Governments decided to initiate intensive dialogue to address mutual concerns and create better understanding of each other's positions. Shri Jaswant Singh, EAM, and Mr. Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State, have been designated as the principal interlocutors. Eight rounds of discussions have been held so far. The talks currently focus on four issues :</p><p style="text-align:justify">(i) CTBT (ii) FMCT (iii) Export Controls (iv) Defence Posture. It has been agreed that regional issues will not feature in these discussions.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The talks are being conducted on the basis of comprehensive proposals made by India, underlying which there is recognition of India's requirement for maintaining a minimal credible nuclear deterrent. We have made it clear that for a successful conclusion of the process, it is essential that our interlocutors help create a positive environment. There has been progress in finding common ground. Both sides have reaffirmed that the basic purpose of the exercise is to lay the foundations of a normal, stable, broad-based relationship. Developments in the regional and global security environment continued to engage our serious consideration. A balanced assessment of the trend over recent years led the Government to undertake a limited series of nuclear test explosions and announce that India is a nuclear-weapon possessing state. In the aftermath, India elaborated its nuclear doctrine based on maintaining a minimum credible deterrent and, a commitment to no-first-use of nuclear weapons. This has been set out clearly in Prime Minister's statement at the UNGA in September 1998 and subsequently in Parliament in December 1998. Diplomatic efforts were undertaken to project India's rationale for our decision to the international community.</p><p style="text-align:justify">High-level dialogues in this regard have been undertaken with the USA, France, UK and Russian Federation. We have also shared our perceptions regularly with the non-nuclear weapon states, in the non-aligned community and elsewhere. We have made clear that India's nuclear capability is purely defensive, does not in any way reflect a threatening, aggressive posture, and will contribute to strengthening stability both in Asia and in the global context. We have also taken initiatives for proposing confidence building measures with countries in our neighbourhood, with a view to enhancing trust and expanding the scope for mutually beneficial bilateral relations, and creating a peaceful and stable regional environment. Our initiatives have yielded positive results.</p><p style="text-align:justify">India's stand in multilateral disarmament fora reflects the continuity of our long-standing commitment to global nuclear disarmament. India's unilateral declaration of a moratorium on nuclear explosive testing was welcomed as were our subsequent statements relating to CTBT. Currently, we are actively engaged in multilateral negotiations in the CD at Geneva for the conclusion of a Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty. This treaty will prohibit future production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. We have also drawn attention to our exemplary record of nonproliferation and the rigour of our export control system, indicating our readiness to make it even more stringent. There has been appreciation of these clarifications and steps by our interlocutors.</p><p style="text-align:justify">India also continued our efforts to generate support in the international community for making use of the opportunity created by the end of the Cold War, for reducing the salience of nuclear weapons and moving towards a nuclear weapon free world. A new initiative taken by India in this regard in the UN General Assembly generated wide support. In keeping with our commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and to strengthening the role of the UN in a multi-polar world, India participated constructively in all areas of UN activity during the year.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Of particular significance was India's contribution to the debate on UN reform, expansion of the UN Security Council, development-related issues, terrorism, and disarmament. We also took active part in the deliberations of the UN on human rights and the environment, which have acquired increasing prominence in the global agenda. The UN continued to grapple in 1998 with critical choices for its reform and revitalisation. The withholding of assessed financial contributions by some countries and unilateral selective actions, including use of military force, to seek to resolve global problems requiring cooperation and consultation for their effective resolution, constituted a major impediment to the strengthening of the multilateral system based on the UN. All this underlined the importance of a purposeful effort for an equitable expansion and restructuring of the UN Security Council, to make it more reflective of the realities of today's world, in particular through the inclusion of developing countries as new permanent members.</p><p style="text-align:justify">There is broad recognition, that under any objective criteria, India is well qualified for permanent membership of such a restructured and expanded Council. India continued to make its traditional contribution to international peace and security through UN Peace Keeping. An Indian battalion was deployed in Lebanon during the year under the UN flag. India also took the initiative to organise a major international seminar on UN peace keeping in Delhi, to strengthen the concepts, doctrine and training methodology for UN peace keeping. The current international economic and financial crisis has provided the impetus for cooperative efforts centred in the UN, for reform of the international financial system.</p><p style="text-align:justify">An international conference on Finance for Development, which has been a long standing demand of the developing countries, has now been endorsed by the UNGA. India is playing an active role in the preparatory work for this conference as a co-Chairman of the Working Group established by the UNGA for this purpose. There was progress at the 53rd session of the UNGA in securing appreciation in the correct perspective of the rationale behind India's nuclear tests. An Indian initiative on "Reducing Nuclear Danger" proposed towards the end of session was endorsed by the broad majority of the UN membership.</p><p style="text-align:justify">India participated actively in the Xllth Summit of the Movement of Non- Alignment countries in Durban in September 1998. As a founder member of NAM, India urged the continued commitment of NAM to its basic principles. The Durban Summit endorsed NAM's traditional emphasis on nuclear disarmament, peace and development. It also reinforced the international community's determination to combat terrorism in all its forms with suggestions for concrete action.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Contributing to the national effort of strengthening our economic security and well being to the citizens of India is the primary objective of the Ministry's conduct of foreign economic relations. The past year saw a greater engagement than ever before in our economic interaction with the outside world, not only bilateral, but also in the regional and multilateral dimension. The Ministry's input was an integral part of the national effort for developing our foreign trade, industrial cooperation, investment, technology transfer relations.</p><p style="text-align:justify">In 1998, we faced a challenging international economic scenario. The global economy which recorded a modest growth of 3% per annum during 1994-97, contracted in 1998 and entered a very difficult and uncertain phase. Though the impact of the East Asian Crisis on India was relatively limited, the Indian economy suffered on account of declining demand for its goods and services in South-East and East Asia, Russia and in recession-struck Japan. India's resilience gives us the confidence that Indian industry will be well positioned to take advantage of the global recovery. The Ministry also, played an active role in the intensified initiatives and measures taken at the national level for encouraging foreign investment inflows, particularly of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India. Major thrust areas included infrastructure development, especially energy, power, telecom and information technology. Investment from NRIs were given particular attention.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably projecting our investment policies, in co-ordination with Indian Missions and Posts abroad, as well as the various economic Ministries and agencies of the Central and State Governments. Negotiations were held with a number of countries for concluding of bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements. The Ministry continued its systematic endeavour to engage the advanced industrialised countries, to develop them as markets for our exports, as source of investment and as partners for technology transfers. Our Missions and Posts abroad centred their efforts to intensify dialogue with them at bilateral and multilateral levels, to project a correct image of India as a substantial partner for trade and investment and industrial/technical cooperation.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Simultaneously, we have sought to safeguard the interests of the developing world by articulating our shared concern over international regimes, crafted largely from the perspectives of the industrially advanced countries. An increased involvement in WTO matters, has led us to study the various disputes to which India was a party to in the WTO, and to examine and comment on the built-in agenda of several WTO agreements. Unilateral trade restrictions that are inconsistent with WTO obligations, technical barriers to trade, pressures for liberalisation in sectors of market interest to the industrialised countries; trade and environment linkages are other issues on which the Ministry has provided inputs. The Ministry's activities in the area of South-South cooperation, to which India attaches great importance were stepped up during the year. In various fora, such as the UN General Assembly, G-77, G-15 or regional and sub-regional associations, such as the Indian Ocean Rim - Association for Regional Cooperation, Indo-ASEAN Dialogue Partnership and BIMSTEC, India reaffirmed its commitment to work for the success of South-South cooperation. This was reiterated by us at the last G-77 Conference. We have substantially increased our contribution to the South Centre in Geneva, which is engaged in projects dealing with South-South Cooperation. India values its participation in G-15, a trans-continental Summit level grouping of developing countries and emerging economies.</p><p style="text-align:justify">At the Cairo Summit last year and the Jamaica Summit in February this year, India joined other G-15 countries in calling for collective efforts to address international economic issues of concern to developing countries, as also to focus on social safety nets to meet the requirements of poor &amp; economically vulnerable people.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry is pursuing several projects in G-15 countries related to vocational training, solar energy, bio-technology, etc. The newly created Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation with 14 member countries, is another significant effort in developing regional cooperation in which India took active part last year. A number of intra-IOR-ARC projects are currently under progress. A Ministerial Confere nce of the IOR-ARC is scheduled to be held in the end of March this year in Mozambique.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Started in 1964, the Indian Technical Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme provides a means of reaching out to other developing countries in the sharing of our developmental experience with them. This programme, which is a concrete manifestation of South-South Cooperation, grew substantially last year with 1326 officials from more than 65 countries having been trained in approximately 40 of our best known-national training institutes, in a range of subjects. 23 Indian experts are currently on deputation abroad and work on several projects was also pursued.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The programme has been generally well received. New ideas to involve more institutions and emerging disciplines in training programmes have met with a good response from the recipients of training. ITEC is a valuable means of bringing officials, trainees, youth of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America in close touch with their counterparts in India and has served to create an important platform for assisting developing countries with regard to their needs.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Regional cooperation in our immediate neighbourhood and beyond is vital part of our global economic strategy. Our active association with transcontinental organisations such as G-15 and in regional organisations such as SAARC, BIMSTEC, IOR-ARC and with ASEAN, EU, SADEC, etc., along with, Indian industry should help our companies to gain access to markets, technology and capital. Expanding our business relations with neighbours and with other regions will help our business to build competitive strengths and prepare themselves to adopt a regional, and eventually, a global approach to product and service delivery.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This accelerated learning through regional programmes will benefit both our industry and government institutions. Interaction with industry representatives has greatly supplemented our effectiveness to mediate on their behalf on market- access, investment, technology transfer, and other commercial issues. These have been, prominent for example, in the export promotion of products such as textiles and software, and in opportunities for Indian investment abroad in sectors such as petroleum, chemicals, software, pharmaceuticals. A leading item on our agenda has been the tackling of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy trade actions against Indian products in Europe and the USA. We also have had intensive dialogues with trade and industry associations on managing the impact of economic restrictions imposed on us in the aftermath of our nuclear tests in May 1998.</p><p style="text-align:justify">For the effective conduct of our foreign economic relations, the Ministry maintains a strong Economic Relations set-up covering multilateral economic relations, technical cooperation and investment promotion and publicity. The work has been carried out in close coordination with the other concerned Ministries, Departments and agencies of the Government of India and the business sector. Special attention was paid to ensuring the effective functioning of our Ministry's establishment both at Headquarters and abroad. The former comprises 32 Divisions including 14 Territorial, 3 Multilateral and 9 Service Divisions, as well as attached offices such as the Foreign Service Institute, ICCR and the Central Passport Organisation.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The establishment abroad is made up of 160 Missions/Posts, including new Missions in Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the recently re-opened Mission in Fiji. Heads of Mission in 41 countries are concurrently accredited to 28 other countries/regions. The Administration/Establishment/Finance set-up of the Ministry provides the logistical, financial and other support for the conduct of our foreign relations. The functioning of our establishments has accordingly been kept under close and regular monitoring and review. For their continued improvement and streamlining, special emphasis has been placed on optimal use of technology especially in information, communication, computerisation, including E.mail, website, as well as human resource development through upgrading of skills and training, in accordance with the growing demands of specialisation, for example, in economic and commercial work, especially areas such as WTO, and in the areas of security, environment, human rights, etc. Yet another important focus of the Administration's work was the rationalisation, both at Headquarters and abroad, of living and working conditions, safeguarding morale and welfare, as well as strengthening discipline and vigilance.</p><p style="text-align:justify">As a result of concerted efforts, Govt. of India now owns 73 Chancery premises, 77 Embassy residences and 600 other residences for officials in our Missions/ Posts abroad. During the year, the Ministry continued its systematic programme for enhancing the stock of GOI owned property abroad for our Missions and Posts, by acquiring built up property or plots for construction through exchange and purchase. A number of projects have been taken up for construction and some are nearing completion. The Ministry has also actively undertaken construction projects for its establishments within India, - including Videsh Bhavan, a composite structure to accommodate the MEA's offices, the Foreign Service Institute, residential complexes, the ICCR building in Calcutta, as well as buildings for Regional Passport Offices. We have paid particular attention to maintenance and upkeep of our premises - at HQ and abroad. The Ministry of External Affairs Budget Allocation for BE 1998-99 is Rs. 2120.72 crores which was enhanced from BE 1997-98 by Rs. 607.30 crores, i.e. about 40%. The RE for 1998-99 is Rs. 2236.17 crores. The Ministry consistently stressed prudent and cost-effective expenditure and economy.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The Ministry and the Central Passport Organization worked vigorously to ensure provision of efficient and transparent services in the passport offices in India, as well as in the Consular wings of the Missions and Posts abroad expanding network of 28 Passport offices and 12 collection centres issued 22 lakh fresh passports in 1998. One new passport office and two new collection centres were opened during the year. Several measures were taken to further streamline. and improve the passport and consular system and make it more responsive to the demands of the public. Three more passport offices were computerised and a project for comprehensive computerisation with satellite link up of all passport offices has been formulated and is expected to be taken up shortly for implementation. An overall plan for construction and renting of more rationally configured and user friendly buildings for passport offices is already under implementation. Measures for ensuring issue of passports within the stipulated period of five weeks through computerisation, dispatch of passports by speed-post in select cities, automatic re-issue in the case of expired passports without prior police verification and augmentation of staff strength in several passport offices have produced results. About 90% of total passports were issued within five weeks of acceptance of applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The public grievances redressal mechanism in the Central Passport Organization was considerably strengthened and a Central Public Grievance Redressal Cell has been opened at the CPO headquarters. Steps were also taken to improve morale and discipline. A Central Passport Advisory Committee is ready to be set up soon. The work relating to the development of international law and conclusion of international agreements and treaties is an integral part of the formulation and implementation of foreign policy. Through the Legal and Treaties Division, the Ministry continued to play an active role in this regard. This included sensitive legal and policy issues arising from the negotiations on environmental law regimes, regulating the conduct of armed conflicts, terrorism and human rights and the International Criminal Court, conclusion of land and maritime boundaries and agreements on international watercourses, extradition and mutual judicial assistance arrangements, as well as trade and transit agreements.</p><p style="text-align:justify">he handling of matters concerning privileges and immunities of diplomatic personnel, consular services, cases involving India in foreign jurisdictions, also formed part of the Ministry's work. The Ministry played a central role in the work relating to the welfare NRIs and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) abroad. This is a multidimensional task encompassing :</p><p style="text-align:justify">(i) Efficient provision of Consular services, and protection of the rights of Indians working abroad, in the context of local laws. This aspect was particularly prominent in the Gulf countries, and in other regions where large Indian communities exists;</p><p style="text-align:justify">(ii) Investment promotion and economic cooperation- this was attended to in coordination with other agencies; (iii) Nurturing of cultural ties - through the ICCR and other channels. The Ministry also took part in the preparations for the PIO-related schemes e.g. 10 years visa and ID cards. In its totality, the work outlined above can be expected to create better links with NRIs/PIO communities abroad, which is a vitally important element of national policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify">The year witnessed an enhanced external publicity effort, in the first place for correctly projecting India's foreign policy and rationale. The aftermath of our nuclear tests provided a major challenge. Through regular statements by the Spokesman, briefings of Indian and foreign media, press releases, audio visual and print material, opinion and policy makers abroad were kept fully informed of our position. This publicity effort has contributed to created a better understanding of our concerns and the rationale of our actions. The Ministry's external publicity effort covered a wider canvas i.e. of projecting India in its larger totality both traditional and modern through publications, films, direct communication with media, electronic means The Ministry's Website has been continuously expanded and gained international recognition for its content and credibility. Our publicity effort included a substantial programme of exchanges of visits and meetings involving leading media personnel, both Indian and foreign. As part of its on-going work, the External Publicity Division also made regular media arrangements for covering incoming and outgoing high level visits.</p><p style="text-align:justify">A major operation in this regard was the organisation of travel to Pakistan of over 200 journalists, both Indian and foreign, to cover our Prime Minister's bus journey to Lahore in February 1999, which was one of the biggest media events ever. During the year, the Ministry handled a full agenda of Protocol work relating to the continued, active exchange of high-level visits and the large diplomatic/consular corps in India. Keeping in mind the Golden Jubilee Year of our independence, the Ministry made a special effort for the propagation of Hindi. Indian Cultural Centres abroad were active in this regard. Books on learning Hindi, our freedom struggle, achievements since independence and other related subjects, and Indian literature, as well as CD Roms on this subjects were made available for gifting in countries with large Hindi speaking resident population. Apart from its function of policy overview and coordinating the preparation of background and research papers, the Policy Planning Division of the Ministry was also actively involved in networking with academic and research institutions concerned with foreign relations, both in Delhi and outside, facilitating the holding of seminars and conferences on foreign policy issues.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This was part of the Ministry's working relationship with the strategic community in the universities, research centres, media etc. This is reflected, for example, in institutionalised regular briefings and discussions between the Ministry and foreign policy experts outside government. The Foreign Service Institute further expanded its activities during the year. While all the regular programmes were continued, there was a signification expansion of the scope and content of each course. The following courses were held in the year under report:</p><p style="text-align:justify">(i)Professional Course in Diplomacy and International Relations for Indian Foreign Service Probationers (1997 batch),</p><p style="text-align:justify">(ii) Basic Professional Course for IFS (B) personnel posted abroad,</p><p style="text-align:justify">(iii) Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats,</p><p style="text-align:justify">(iv) Familiarization Programme for Resident Foreign Diplomats,</p><p style="text-align:justify">(v) Language Courses and</p><p style="text-align:justify">(vi) Orientation Course for Non-MEA officers. Curricular continued to be streamlined and updated. Action was also initiated to optimise functioning of the computer and language training facilities. The year 1998-99, witnessing the climax of the celebrations of the Fiftieth Anniversary of our independence was an extremely active one for the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), an autonomous body attached to the Ministry of External Affairs. 1700 cultural performances were held in India and in 110 countries abroad, by 155 Indian and 50 foreign troupes under the auspices of the Council during the anniversary year (almost a four fold increase over previous year).</p><p style="text-align:justify">Other mandated activities of the Council, including the exchange of distinguished scholars and visitors, holding of seminars and lectures, exhibitions, installations of statues, and publications, have all shown remarkable increase. Noteworthy among these are the special anniversary activities, such as the Exhibition on Treasures of Indian Art - Germany's Tribute to India's Cultural Heritage, organised in collaboration with the Department of Culture and a compendium of Essays on Society, Polity, Economy and Culture, by some of the country's best minds, entitled 'Independent India : The First Fifty Years".</p><p style="text-align:justify">The 14 Indian Cultural Centres (including Colombo opened in 1998), and the 20 Chairs of Indian studies (including Moscow set up in 1998) also functioned satisfactorily. The scholarship programme-catering to some 1800 foreign students, mostly from developing countries - is a critically important international cooperation scheme and continued to receive the fullest attention of Council. Apart from ICCR organised programmes, the Ministry administered the self- financing scheme for foreign students for certain professional courses in India.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This was done through the Coordination Division which is also the Ministry's nodal point for Parliament work, examining proposals for foreign tours of Ministers and for conferences in India.</p><p style="text-align:justify">1999</p><p style="text-align:justify">India's Neighbours</p><p style="text-align:justify">Section 1<br>Afghanistan India closely monitored the continuing fratricidal conflict in Afghanistan, a country with which it has historical ties of friendship and cooperation. India maintained close contacts with various parties and groups within Afghanistan. India believes that there can be no military solution to the internecine war which is being fueled by foreign involvement, principally from across Afghanistan's southern borders. The military situation remained influx.

Pakistan Overview Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee took a historic initiative to visit Lahore on February 20-21, 1999 on the inaugural run of the Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service.<p></p><p>His visit was part of India's consistent efforts to build peaceful, friendly and cooperative ties with Pakistan and establish a relationship based on mutual respect and a regard for each other's concerns. Earlier, the resumption of the official dialogue between the two countries in October 1998 marked a success in India's endeavours to engage Pakistan in a composite and comprehensive dialogue process that would build trust and confidence, explore avenues of mutually beneficial cooperation and address outstanding issues. A crucial element in Pakistan's attitude and approach towards India, however, was its engaging in terrorism, firing across the international border and Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and hostile propaganda.</p><p>Prime Minister's Visit India's basic policy approach towards Pakistan was underlined by Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee's declaration that a stable, prosperous and secure Pakistan was in India's interest. This sentiment was reaffirmed by him from the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore on February 21, 1999. Prime Minister's visit was the most significant engagement between India and Pakistan in over a quarter of a century. It was also the first visit undertaken by the Prime Minister of India to Pakistan in a decade. During his visit, the Prime Minister conveyed to the Government and people of Pakistan India's deep desire for peace and friendship with them and for developing a comprehensive structure of cooperation for the benefit of the two peoples.</p><p>The Prime Minister and the Pakistan Prime Minister signed the Lahore Declaration which is a landmark for peace and security of the two countries. A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed by the Foreign Secretaries under which India and Pakistan will work to enter into agreements to put into place far-reaching Confidence Building Measures. In a Joint Statement issued on the occasion, the two countries also identified new and significant areas of cooperation such as Information Technology and decided to address humanitarian issues at a ministerial level on an urgent basis.

Prime Minister also emphasised that Pakistan's instigation of and support to terrorism against India were incompatible with the development of peaceful and friendly relations and that these activitiesmust cease immediately. During Prime Minister's meeting with Prime Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif in New York on 23 September, 1998, the Foreign Secretaries of India and Pakistan reported to the two Prime Ministers that they had reached an agreement on the modalities of the dialogue process.</p><p>(The subjects for the dialogue were agreed upon in June 1997 and are: Peace &amp; Security including CBMs, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Siachen, Tulbul Navigation Project, Sir Creek, Economic and Commercial Cooperation, Terrorism and Drug Trafficking and Promotion of Friendly Exchanges in various fields). The Prime Ministers welcomed this development and issued directions for the resumption of the dialogue. The first round of the composite dialogue process was held in October and November 1998. The subjects of Peace &amp; Security including CBMs and Jammu &amp; Kashmir were discussed by the Foreign Secretaries in Islamabad in October 1998. The subjects of Tulbul Navigation Project, Siachen, Sir Creek, Economic and Commercial Cooperation, Terrorism and Drug Trafficking and Promotion of Friendly Exchanges in various fields were discussed, respectively, by the Secretary, Water Resources of India and Secretary, Water and Power of Pakistan; the Defence Secretaries; the Surveyor General of India and Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence, of Pakistan; the Commerce Secretaries; the Home Secretary of India and the Interior Secretary of Pakistan; and the Culture Secretaries, in New Delhi in November 1998.</p><p>During talks on Peace &amp; Security including CBMs, India drew Pakistan's attention to India's security needs which were a function of its size and assets. India emphasised that its security concerns were not one-country specific and that its defence profile was non-aggressive. In this context, India proposed the upgradation of existing CBMs and the need to put in place new CBMs, ranging from information exchange and improved communication links to exchanging views on security concepts and nuclear doctrines. India also emphasised the need to build mutual confidence in the nuclear and conventional fields. During discussions on Jammu &amp; Kashmir, India made it clear that the legal status of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, i.e. that the entire State is an integral part of India, is clear and does not admit of any change. India also demanded that Pakistan cease forthwith its futile instigation and sponsorship of terrorism in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, which constituted a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Simla Agreement.</p><p>During talks on the Tulbul Navigation Project, India drew Pakistan's attention to understandings that had been reached during earlier discussions on this subject and that can be the basis for a resolution of the issue. During discussions on Siachen, India stressed the need for a cease fire in the area as a first step. On the subject of Sir Creek, India proposed that, pending agreement on the land boundary, the maritime boundary could be demarcated by starting at sea and proceeding landwards. At the discussions on Terrorism and Drug Trafficking, India gave Pakistan detailed evidence regarding its role in sponsoring terrorism against India and demanded that Pakistan close down training camps for terrorists and hand over terrorists and fugitives from the law who have been given sanctuary in Pakistan.</p><p>During discussions on Economic and Commercial Cooperation, India emphasised that there were many avenues for mutually beneficial cooperation including in areas such as electric power and transportation. Detailed discussions on the technical, legal and financial aspects at the expert-level have taken place in Islamabad and New Delhi on the subject of purchase of power by India from Pakistan. These discussions are continuing. On the subject of Promotion of Friendly Exchanges, India proposed a cultural exchange programme which would build on the commonalities between the two countries. India also emphasised the need of regular contacts to address humanitarian issue relating to fishermen and civilian prisoners and people-to- people contacts.</p><p>India released a total of 149 Pakistani fishermen in its custody. It also proposed to Pakistan that the fishermen of the two countries who stray innocently into the territorial waters of the other country should not be kept in custody but should be released on completion of formalities. Acting on this principle, India conveyed to Pakistan on 2 November 1998 its decision to release 40 Pakistani fishermen who were captured on 24 October, 1998. Pakistan also released 190 Indian fishermen who were held in its custody. India took the initiative to start a Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service. An agreement and a protocol for the regulation of this service were signed in Islamabad on 17 February, 1999. Trial runs of an Indian bus to Pakistan and a Pakistani bus to India had been held in January 1999.</p><p>Pakistan's Support to Terrorism Pakistan's support to and involvement in terrorist activities in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and other parts of India continues unabated. This was strongly taken up by Prime Minister during his visit to Pakistan, and also by Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary during the dialogue process. It was pointed out that the atmosphere generated by the open exhortation of terrorist actions in India by fundamentalist organisations in Pakistan, many of which enjoyed official patronage, was not conducive to a normalisation of bilateral relations. India urged that Pakistan take urgent steps to demonstrate its commitment to tackling the issue of terrorism.</p><p>Pakistan's Nuclear and Missile Programmes India has carefully been following Pakistan's pursuit of clandestine weapons oriented nuclear and missile programmes, which have been developed with assistance from abroad. On 6 April, 1998, Pakistan announced the successful test of a ballistic missile, the Hatf V (Ghauri). Pakistan also announced that it had conducted tests of six nuclear devices on 28-30 May, 1998. It said that the tests were in reaction to India's nuclear tests carried out earlier in May 1998. In response to these tests, Government of India's official spokesman said that this event vindicated India's assessment regarding the nature of Pakistani programme and policy as well as the measures India had taken. He also said that Government of India had taken all steps necessary for safeguarding the nation's security.</p><p>Conclusion India seeks a relationship of trust, friendship and cooperation with Pakistan. Our approaches to Pakistan are rooted in our national consensus, which favours moving relations ahead with Pakistan over a broad front through the composite dialogue process. These approaches derive their strength from our confidence as a mature nation dedicated to peace, democracy and freedom. It is our earnest hope to build-on the opportunities that are now available on account of the Prime Minister's initiative and his commitment to put behind past connections and think of the welfare of coming generations. The Lahore Declaration and the Memorandum of Understanding on Confidence Building Measures and the Joint Statement are significant developments in our bilateral relations. We trust Pakistan will fully reciprocate our initiatives and abandon the path of confrontation and promotion of terrorism in India.</p><p>Section 2</p><p>India's relations with its eastern and southern neighbours- Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives and Sri Lanka - reflected a continuity of policy and approach in the development of close understanding and active collaboration in mutually beneficial development efforts. There was focus on sectors of specific interest to each of the countries concerned covering a wide range of areas. Equally important was the sustained dialogue covering ongoing matters of operational importance such as border management. The economic and social dimensions however provided the thrust for progress in increased engagement.

The Summit took some significant decisions to advance cooperation in the core economic areas of trade and investment. A Group of Experts from all seven SAARC Countries will be set up to commence negotiations on an Agreement or Treaty for a South Asian Free Trade Area. This Agreement will spell out binding schedules for freeing trade and is expected to be finalised and put in place by 2001.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This would provide a predictable and transparent blue- print for achieving a Free Trade Area in South Asia. The Agreement will also include special facilitative measures for the Least Developed Countries. Negotiations for deepening and widening trade preferences under the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement will continue in parallel. SAARC leaders at their meeting in Colombo directed that the Third Round of SAPTA negotiations should be concluded quickly and also directed that the Fourth Round of SAPTA negotiations should commence immediately thereafter, with the mandate of extending deeper tariff concessions to products which are being actively traded or are likely to be traded. Discriminatory trade practices and non-tariff barriers are to be simultaneously removed on items in respect of which tariff concessions are granted. This would ensure that we continue to liberalise trade, even as the negotiations for a SAFTA Agreement are underway.</p><p style="text-align:justify">India took some bold initiatives to enhance access to its market. The Prime Minister announced that India would lift Quantitative Restrictions for SAARC countries with effect from August 1, 1998.

This was appreciated as an indication of India's commitment to encourage a greater flow of Indian investment in its immediate neighbourhood.</p><p style="text-align:justify">India also offered to consider bilateral free trade arrangements with those countries who are interested in moving faster.

Significant decisions were also taken to strengthen cooperation in the social sectors. SAARC leaders agreed in Colombo to draw up a Social Charter for SAARC setting out regional goals in the important areas of population stabilisation, education, health, nutrition, child welfare and women's development. Particular focus has been placed on the persistent problem of poverty in the region and the leaders of SAARC countries have committed themselves to the eradication of poverty in South Asia preferably by the year 2002. A three-tier institutional structure to evolve cooperation in this field has been set up. These three tiers comprise: A Group of Secretaries to Governments dealing with Poverty Eradication and Social Development; the Group of Finance/Planning Secretaries; and SAARC Finance/Planning Ministers.</p><p style="text-align:justify">This mechanism is a forum for exchange of information on poverty eradication programmes, strategies and technologies. The impact of structural adjustment programmes and economic liberalisation on weaker sections of society has been kept in focus through the involvement of Finance/Planning Ministers at the highest level. The text of the Regional Convention to Combat Illegal Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution was finalised. SAARC leaders agreed that the scope of the Convention could be expanded in time to cover trafficking for other purposes. The Convention is expected to be signed at the next SAARC Summit in Kathmandu. A separate Convention on Child Welfare is also under discussion. A new initiative has been taken to develop cooperation in the field of Distance Education.

The closeness of relationship was reflected in the exchange of visits with these countries, including visit of H.R.H. Crown Prince of Thailand to India and holding of Joint Commission Meetings with Laos and Vietnam. Total bilateral trade with ASEAN countries in 1997-98 was US$ 5.98 billion compared to US$ 5.99 billion in 1996-97. The marginal decline in bilateral trade can be largely attributed to the fall in the value of the currencies of ASEAN countries and contraction in imports from India. The economic difficulties facing these countries have posed new challenges and we offered to cooperate with these countries in finding ways and means to ensure that the crisis does not adversely impact on our economic &amp; commercial relations.<br><br>Our ties with ASEAN have been developing satisfactorily since India became a Full Dialogue Partner of the ASEAN in 1996.

In response to the Australian measures Indian Government took reciprocal actions. The Australian government in December, 1998 decided to relax the suspension on Ministerial and senior officials' visits, but the other restrictions remained in place.

After a considerable time, funds are now being transferred by the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC), Geneva. Transfer of funds is taking place roughly once every six months for partial settlement of category A &amp; C claims  $ 2500 per claim. Disbursement of the compensation money to successful claimants is being done by four designated nationalised Banks. The four Banks, with the active cooperation and guidance of the Special Kuwait Cell, are carrying out the task of locating the successful claimants (many of whom have shifted residences or gone abroad), and paying their claim amounts.</p><p>In September 1998, UNCC transferred $ 93,542,500 for partial settlement of 37,417 claims approved in the 4th instalment of category A. UNCC has also transferred $ 14,255,510.61 for partial settlement of 5,869 claims in the 4th instalment of category C.</p><p>UNCC has also finalized the list of approved claims for the 6th instalment of category C.

They have also started sending lists of approved claims in category D, i.e., claims exceeding $100,000. In the 29th UNCC Governing Council Meeting (Geneva, 28-30 September, 1998), 23 Indian claims in category D have been approved for a total value of $ 522574.</p><p>In April 1998, a UNCC team of loss-adjustors and legal experts visited India for an on-site appraisal of documents pertaining to the Government of India claim in category F. Special Kuwait Cell made effective arrangements for a successful appraisal operation. As a result, the India's Govt. claim was processed expeditiously, although it was initially classified as "unusually large and complex". It has been approved for $ 92,621,397 in the 29th UNCC Governing Council Meeting. The actual transfer of the amount may, however, take some time. It would depend on the availability of funds from Iraq and payment prioritization between different claim categories, decided upon by the UNCC. India was among the few countries who made official statement at the 29th Governing Council Meeting. The thrust of India's statement was that some degree of priority should be given to the small claims under categories A &amp; C, after the first-part payments are completed.</p><p>It is the exclusive responsibility of the UNCC to evaluate and scrutinize the claims, evolve a payment procedure and deliver the awarded compensation to eligible claimants for payment through national Governments. Up to 31 December, 1998 the Special Kuwait Cell had been instrumental in the disbursement of the following amounts, in cooperation with the four designated Banks:</p><p>CategoryAmount disbursedNo. of claimants<br>(US $)covered<br>A85022500.0030201<br>B617000.00163<br>C12141782.494890<br>Total97781282.4935254<br>Towards end-March 1999, we expect to receive from UNCC, further funds for installments V of categories A &amp; C (depending on the financial situation on UNCC).</p><p>As important meeting of the UNCC Governing Council is also expected to take place in March. Among other things, this Meeting is expected to take a view on the payment priorities, after the first phase of payments for categories A &amp; C gets completed.

Its main task is obtaining and distributing compensation for the Indian nationals and organizations who were adversely affected by the Gulf War of 1990-91. After a considerable time, funds are now being transferred by the United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC), Geneva. Transfer of funds is taking place roughly once every six months for partial settlement of category A &amp; C claims  $ 2500 per claim. Disbursement of the compensation money to successful claimants is being done by four designated nationalised Banks. The four Banks, with the active cooperation and guidance of the Special Kuwait Cell, are carrying out the task of locating the successful claimants (many of whom have shifted residences or gone abroad), and paying their claim amounts.</p><p>In September 1998, UNCC transferred $ 93,542,500 for partial settlement of 37,417 claims approved in the 4th instalment of category A. UNCC has also transferred $ 14,255,510.61 for partial settlement of 5,869 claims in the 4th instalment of category C.</p><p>UNCC has also finalized the list of approved claims for the 6th instalment of category C. This covers 8,621 Indian claims, of a total value of over $ 101 million. UNCC is in the process of finalising the list for the 7th (and the last) instalment of category C. They have also started sending lists of approved claims in category D, i.e., claims exceeding $100,000. In the 29th UNCC Governing Council Meeting (Geneva, 28-30 September, 1998), 23 Indian claims in category D have been approved for a total value of $ 522574.</p><p>In April 1998, a UNCC team of loss-adjustors and legal experts visited India for an on-site appraisal of documents pertaining to the Government of India claim in category F. Special Kuwait Cell made effective arrangements for a successful appraisal operation. As a result, the India's Govt. claim was processed expeditiously, although it was initially classified as "unusually large and complex". It has been approved for $ 92,621,397 in the 29th UNCC Governing Council Meeting. The actual transfer of the amount may, however, take some time. It would depend on the availability of funds from Iraq and payment prioritization between different claim categories, decided upon by the UNCC. India was among the few countries who made official statement at the 29th Governing Council Meeting. The thrust of India's statement was that some degree of priority should be given to the small claims under categories A &amp; C, after the first-part payments are completed.</p><p>It is the exclusive responsibility of the UNCC to evaluate and scrutinize the claims, evolve a payment procedure and deliver the awarded compensation to eligible claimants for payment through national Governments. Up to 31 December, 1998 the Special Kuwait Cell had been instrumental in the disbursement of the following amounts, in cooperation with the four designated Banks:</p><p>CategoryAmount disbursedNo. of claimants<br>(US $)covered<br>A85022500.0030201<br>B617000.00163<br>C12141782.494890<br>Total97781282.4935254<br>Towards end-March 1999, we expect to receive from UNCC, further funds for installments V of categories A &amp; C (depending on the financial situation on UNCC).</p><p>As important meeting of the UNCC Governing Council is also expected to take place in March. Among other things, this Meeting is expected to take a view on the payment priorities, after the first phase of payments for categories A &amp; C gets completed. In the Governing Council Meeting of September 98, India made an official statement which, inter alia, stated that in the second phase of payments, a degree of priority should be given to completion of payments for categories A &amp; C."</p><p>WANA Region India maintained its support for the Arab and Palestinian causes as well as the Middle East Peace Process.

Conclusion Africa is in a phase of transition, leaving behind the legacies of the past, and moving towards a many-splendoured future embracing democracy, economic reform and a constructive emergence of regional identities. India, with its unique developmental experience, and as the world's largest democracy undergoing significant economic reform, has a vital role to play in underpinning and moulding such an African future. The people of Indian origin who have made Africa their home in almost every corner of the continent are a natural bridge in re-enforcing our future ties with Africa. However, India's diplomatic vision extends beyond such natural ethnic affinities to embrace the interests of Africa as a whole, particularly in the priority area of economic progress and development. Such an economic congruence is facilitated by a broad agreement between India and the countries of Africa on their vision of a new world order characterised by peace, justice and equity, and fully responsive to the needs and interests of the developing world. uu<br><br>MAURITIUS NAMIBIA SOUTH AFRICA USA INDIA KENYA MALI UGANDA RWANDA ETHIOPIA SEYCHELLES CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MADAGASCAR TANZANIA CONGO ZIMBABWE ZAMBIA BOTSWANA NIGER NIGERIA SENEGAL BURKINA FASO COTE D'IVOIRE GHANA ERITREA DJIBOUTI LESOTHO ANGOLA GUINEA GUINEA-BISSAU SIERRA LEONE GABON THE GAMBIA</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: left;">1999</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Europe</p><p>Eastern Europe Section 1 India's traditionally warm, friendly and cooperative relations with the Russian Federation and the countries of East and Central Europe continued to develop steadily during the year.

The European Union (EU), of which 15 countries of the region are members, is India's largest trading partner and the second largest source of approved foreign investment. The adoption of the Euro by 11 of its member states and the evolution of a Common Foreign and Security Policy are significant pointers to the emergence of an "European identity", which would have an increasingly important role in international affairs.</p><p>Normal dialogue and interaction has continued in 1998-99 with the countries of West Europe, as also with the EU.

While most of the countries in West Europe and the EU expressed concern at the nuclear tests conducted by India in May 1998, the specific reactions by different countries were far from uniform.

The UK is also the largest cumulative investor in India with a figure of Pounds Stg 3 billion. The presence of a large community of Indian origin, which has done well economically, strengthens the traditional links between the two countries.</p><p>The UK in its individual capacity and as the then EU Presidency had been initially critical of the nuclear tests conducted by India. Since then bilateral consultations at a high level have helped to place relations on a firmer footing. The Principal Secretary to PM visited UK on 4 &amp; 5 June, 1998, as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister and on 20 &amp; 21 January, 1991.

The finalisation of the Economic and Monetary Union with the adoption of a single currency Euro by 11 member states of the EU from January 1999 has significance for the international financialsystem as also implications for the attempts to forge a "European identity" in internationalaffairs. The EU is working on plans for an eastward expansionand thereis a serious discussion on the need for its internal financial reforms. There have been moves towards initiating a discussion on NATO's nuclear doctrine and the scope and mandate of its activities, even as it prepares to accept three new members from 1999, its 50th anniversaryyear. The forthcoming NATO Summit to be held in Washington in April 1999 is expected to consider a New Strategic Concept for the organization which may go beyond the defence of the territories of member countries. These developments impact on the evolving security architecture in Europe and have implications for the security around that region.</p><p>The EU, with its fifteen member countries is the largest economic entity in the world today. It is India's largest trade partner with anannual bilateral trade of over US $ 21 billion in 1997. It is also India's second largest source of approved foreign investment (over Rs 300 billion during 1991-August 1998) and an important partner in technology cooperation.</p><p>The 11th Round of annual India-EU Ministerial level talks was held in New Delhi on 13 November, 1998.

In the early part of the year, there was continuation of a broad based dialogue which both countries had agreed upon. In that context, US Permanent Representative to UN, Bill Richardson headed a delegation to India from April 14-15, 1998. The Indian and the US side had useful exchanges of views on a number of important international, bilateral and regional issues.</p><p>Following India's nuclear tests, the US reaction was extremely critical and negative. The reaction was made up of several elements including what the United States saw as a challenge to the non-proliferation regime which the United States and other nuclear-weapon states have south to put in place to preserve their monopoly of nuclear weapons. It also contained elements of frustration at US inability to detect the tests in advance. India look every opportunity to respond to such statements wherever necessary.</p><p>The US also took the initiative in meetings of the P-5 and G-8 to orchestrate condemnation of the nuclear tests. Many of these countries, however, did not go along with attempts to multilateralise the imposition of restrictive economic measures against India.</p><p>Since then, the reaction has toned down and, to some extent, moderated, This has been reflected in more balanced coverage in the US media. There have been a number of articles and statements from eminent US political personalities and strategic analysts which reflect a better understanding of India's security concerns. There has also been considerable debate in the United States regarding the effectiveness of the coercive economic measures called "sanctions".</p><p>Despite development of the strains in the bilateral relationship, the visits of prominent US political representative continued. US Senators Sam Brownback and Charles Robb, visited India from June 26-30. On their return to the US, these Senators introduced an Amendment to provide authority to the President to waive for up to one year some of the economic measures under Glenn Amendment. In July 1998, US Congress passed an amendment which was called "Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998" which exempted finance and credit guarantees for agricultural commodities, medicine and fertilisers from the purview of 1994.</p><p>After the nuclear tests and the apprehensions expressed in several countries, it was decided to have a more intensive dialogue with the United States. Shri Jaswant Singh, then Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission and Mr Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State have been designated as Representatives to conduct this dialogue.</p><p>The talks are being conducted on the basis of the comprehensive proposals that India has put forward on disarmament and non-proliferation matters, our unilateral moratorium on explosive nuclear tests, willingness to discuss converting this moratorium into a de jure obligation, our offer to enter into constructive negotiations on the FMCT and reaffirming our policies on stringent control on export of sensitive technologies.</p><p>The talks have focussed on issues related to disarmament and non-proliferation. Both sides have agreed that these issues should be kept distinct from regional issues. After six rounds of discussions the talks have narrowed down four issues. These are the CTBT, the FMCT, Export Controls and Defence Posture. On Export Control Issues an expert level meeting was also held in New Delhi on 9-10 November, 1998. The meeting was deemed helpful by both India and the US to the prospects of continuing cooperation in this area. Both sides have agreed to meet in 2nd half of January 1999 in New Delhi to carry forward this dialogue.</p><p>The US has recently announced a partial lifting of the restrictive measures imposed against India. These relate to EXIM, OPIC, TDA Financing and Military Training. The US has stated that these measures are being lifted in recognition of the progress made in the bilateral dialogue. It is however noted that non- basic human needs financing from multilateral financial institutions is still subject to US restrictions. India regards these coercive and restrictive measures as unjustified and counter-productive which should be lifted.</p><p>The US has also issued a list of Indian Government Organisations, Research Institutions, PSUs and Private Companies, which will be subject to export restrictions. This step is with clearly punitive intent. India has made it clear to the US that such measures will be regarded as adverse developments in our relations and will not be conducive to the ongoing dialogue.

Demands for our training programmes are growing as during 1998-99, 1326 nominees were trained which is the highest number as compared to 1995-96 (970 nominees), 1996-97 (1001 nominees) and 1997- 98 (1031 nominees).</p><p>Every year ITEC Day is celebrated by the Indian Missions abroad on 15th September. This year the event was also celebrated at Headquarters after a gap of 5 years. The event was attended by about 350 guests consisting of Heads of Diplomatic Missions/other Diplomats of more than 60 countries who are recipients of ITEC assistance, high-level Government officials, representatives of various Training Institutes, media personnel and about 100 trainees both civilian and military trainees who were at that time undergoing training at various Institutes located at New Delhi. The gathering was addressed by the Foreign Secretary who spoke about various activities being undertaken under ITEC Programme and its future orientation. This was followed by a cultural programme presented by candidates from Zimbabwe, Uzbekistan, Mauritius, Uganda.</p><p>On December 14-15, 1998, a Conference of the Training Institutes empanelled under ITEC was convened at New Delhi under the Chairmanship of Secretary (ER) Shri S T Devare and addressed by AS (FA) Shri B N Jha. The Conference was the first of its kind organized by the Ministry of External Affairs and was considered timely in view of the growing potential which training and capacity building activities for promoting India's bilateral relations with the developing countries. The Conference was also useful to discuss problems of coordination between our Diplomatic Missions, the Training Institutes and TC Division and many suggestions for procedural improvements emerged from it. There was a consensus that India can be more effectively projected through the ITEC programme as an important training destination for developing countries by streamlining the effectiveness of performance at these three levels. Training Institutes, appreciating the leverage which, having an international profile, can give them to generate important commercial spin-off benefits for themselves, and by extension for the country, were urged to improve their performance under ITEC accordingly.</p><p>Military Training is another important task undertaken under ITEC Programme. TC Division is a nodal point for organizing Military Training for nominees of friendly foreign Governments in some of the more prestigious Defence institutions of India such as Indian Military Academy, National Defence College, Defence Service Staff College etc. During this year approximately 198 slots for long and short term training courses were offered under ITEC and approximately 237 slots under Self-Financing Schemes. Some slots were also offered on a reciprocal basis. Appendices - XVI-XIX contain the lists of countries whose candidates were trained under ITEC Programme.</p><p>Another important aspect of the ITEC Programme is project cooperation with partner countries. Such cooperation, extended over many years since ITEC was established in 1964, has enhanced India's image as a country which is generous in sharing her experience and expertise acquired in the past fifty years of her independent existence, with other developing countries. In 1998-99 plans to establish a Plastic Technology Demonstration and Common Facility Centre in a backward region of Namibia by NSIC at a cost Rs. 3.40 crores were finalised, soon after a visit to that country by the Indian Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee. A major project to set up an Entrepreneur and Technical Development Centre (ETDC) at a cost of Rs.13 crores in Dakar (Senegal) launched last year in fulfillment of a G-15 commitment, was executed in considerable measure by HMT (I) despite initial setbacks. The Mini Dairy Plant supplied last year to Kyrghyzstan at a cost of Rs.1.75 crores has gone into production of milk and butter. Plans to send six farmers from Punjab to Burkina Faso for three years to demonstrate Indian agricultural techniques especially for growing rice, were carried further.</p><p>In addition to project assistance, the TC Division supplied equipment for upgradation of the Upadhyay Training Centre in Mauritius, irrigation pumps to Uganda, Ambulances and Incubators to the Indira Gandhi Maternity Clinic in Namibia, diesel pumps and sewing machines to Ivory Coast and textile machinery to Vietnam in 1998-99. A list of projects and project-related assistance extended this year to different countries may be seen at Appendix - XX. As of now, there are 23 experts on long term deputation (from 2 to 3 years) to various countries as advisors in fields ranging from agriculture to medicine, marine engineering, water management, accountancy, fish toxicity, teaching, legislative drafting and in military fields (list is at Appendix - XXI). Seven short-term experts have also been sent to a few countries this year. Over the years, Indian experts have been acknowledged by many developing countries to have done commendable work in building institutional frameworks for self-reliant growth with limited means.</p><p>On the recommendations of Indian Heads of Missions, Study Visits by senior level officers and decision-makers are organized every year by the TC Division from various partner countries. Visits, generally in the areas of small scale industries, agriculture, health and education, trade and commerce etc. are an extremely popular method of introducing foreign visitors to different developmental sectors in the Indian economy and polity as they offer a first- hand exposure to Indian economic conditions. Nine study visits took place in the year under review. These include a visit by Prof Alberto Simao, Chairman, National Institute for Development of Local Industry, Mozambique to see the various industries and R&amp;D centres engaged in improving the quality of products of the small-scale units under the supervision of the DCSSI. A four-member delegation from Nairobi University led by Prof D N Kariuku, Chairman, Department of Chemistry visited various Institutions and chemical industries to learn from Indian experience of the interface between academic training and commercial activity in the field of chemistry.</p><p>Also invited was a three-member delegation from Vietnam headed by Director, Cuu Long Rice Research Institute, Dr Nguyen Van Luat to visit some Agricultural Universities and see some items of agricultural machinery which are manufactured in India. Two more agricultural delegations were invited in response to interest expressed by them in knowing about our Green Revolution - (i) a four-member delegation from Mongolia headed by Mr Y A Balgansuren, Director, Department of Policy Coordination, Ministry of Industry &amp; Agriculture, and (ii) a three-member delegation from Kyrghyzstan headed by Mr Tolobek E Omuraliev, Advisor to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic and Head of the Department of Local Self Government and Agricultural Policy under the Presidential Administration.</p><p>The visitors were taken to our Agricultural Research &amp; Development Centres in Pusa, Karnal, Shimla, Ludhiana and for discussions with our authorities there. Mr A W Searle, Warden of the Zimbabwe Zoo was invited to interact with the Wildlife Institute in Dehra Dun. Two senior officials from the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation visited India and were shown Doordarshan and AIR facilities with a view to long-term cooperation between India and Namibia in this important sector of information and communication technology. Mr Patrick Mandago, Namibian Chief of Protocol visited to study the functioning of the Protocol Division of the Ministry. Sometimes, a study visit is arranged to acquire expertise from the visitors as was the case when Mr J R Muller, General Manager of a South African Government- owned Company called Abakor came to India to advise the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on improvements in its abattoirs in Delhi and Aligarh, also during this year.</p><p>Under the Aid to Disaster Relief Programme (ADR), TC Division provides humanitarian aid for disaster relief to various countries, in the form of medicines, clothing, food etc. In the current financial year, medicines and foodgrain were sent to Bangladesh for victims of some of the worst floods that the country has known. Afghanistan's earthquake victims were assisted with medicine, blankets, tents and biscuits. Many other countries such as Comoros, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Sudan, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Peru, Tajikistan and Kyrghyzstan received quantities of medicines and other forms of assistance depending upon their expressed requirements. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean affected Hurricanes George and Mitch respectively were also assisted with small quantities of medicines and surgical instruments under the ADR programme. A complete list of the relief supplied by India under this programme in 1998-99 may be seen at Appendix - XXII.

Major thrust areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power, telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment Promotion and Publicity Division to actively undertake effective investment promotion and publicity efforts, particularly through the Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missions are the first point of contact for the foreign investor.</p><p>It is, therefore, essential that the Missions are given full back-up support in their efforts in the form of providing up-to-date information about the economy, the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and opportunities available in different sectors, the incentives offered by the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these and related matters the Investment Promotion and Publicity (IPP) Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments or other agencies, as the case may be.</p><p>Policy The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever required, based on investment trends world-wide and based on the need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and our economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the Missions on foreign investor perceptions about India's investment policies or about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving as inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national interest. The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), where it was represented by Secretary (Economic Relations). Investments from NRIs were given particular attention. FIPB was also empowered to give a firm 'Yes' or 'No' answer to every proposal involving FDI within a deadline of 60 days.</p><p>Promotional Efforts and Initiatives The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably projecting the various investment policies and announcements of the Government by co-ordinating with the Missions on the one hand and various economic Ministries of the Central Government and State Governments on the other. Economic news about India was regularly disseminated to all the Missions highlighting major policy decisions and new opportunities, thus keeping them abreast of developments. Missions were also encouraged to hold investment promotion seminars and workshops besides extending investment support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of our Missions in identified target countries. Ministry also undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures and opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.</p><p><br>The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations. The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by the Missions, visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having appropriate meetings with concerned Government Departments, the Apex Chambers of Commerce, the State Governments etc. The Ministry also participated in many bilateral or other meetings/conferences involving overseas investor groups. Among the many delegations was also a 30-member International Public Affairs's Centre (IPAC) delegation which visited India from 17-20 January, 1999. The IPAC is an association of Presidents of multinational corporations and currently has 150 leading business houses among its members.</p><p>The Ministry also actively assisted various organisations in the country such as the apex chambers, Exim Bank, Indian Investment Centre, in organising investment/trade promotion events in India including the Global Indian Entrepreneurs Conference (12-13 November, 1998), India Economic Summit (29 November-1 December, 1998), various joint business councils and other events. The Ministry actively participated in the efforts to mobilise good response for the Resurgent India Bond Scheme launched by the State Bank of India to which our Missions lent full support. Eventually, the scheme proved a success mobilising over US$ 4.16 billion.</p><p>Publicity The following publications were brought out this year by the IPP Division for theuse of our Missions and Posts: a)The IPP Division brought out an illustrative brochure "India - Investment Related Websites" inAugust 1998. The brochure gives information regarding websitelocationand home page of several of the economic ministries of Government of India, the State Governments and a number of other investment related agencies.</p><p>b)IPP Division in association with World Link, which is the magazine of the World Economic Forum and Investor Access, a CD-ROM publisher in UK,brought out a CD-ROM on "India - Priorities for the 21st Century" in August 1998. This is a unique multimedia guide to India for Investors conveying a comprehensive picture about the evolving scene in India as the country moves towards the 21st Century. Industrial and investment policies of all the State and Union Territories have been featured along with analysis of 20 different sectors, each highlighting the potential for growth and the vast opportunities opening up. The CD also has a complete guide for foreigninvestors on policies and procedures for foreign investment. The hyperlinks given for important websites, the CD virtually acts as a gateway to the larger data base contained in most of the investment related websites of India.</p><p>As per the arrangement worked out with World Link, the CD was distributed by them to all the participants of the last Davos Summit of World Economic Forum. Copies of CD were also sent to all our missions abroad who sent copies to key local chambers of commerce or large corporate groups and are also using it as a presentational aide while addressing investment promotion seminars or other such speaking opportunities.</p><p>c)"Investment Avenues for Non-Resident Indians" - a new publication which gave information on investment opportunities including in portfolio investment, investments in debt securities and deposits and investment in real estate while also outlining options for returning NRIs and provided answers to some of the most frequently asked questions on NRI investment and related subjects. The brochure was also circulated to participants at the Global Indian Entrepreneurs Conference held in New Delhi from 12-13 November, 1998.</p><p>d)A revised edition of "India Means Business - Perspectives" in a user friendly format and design, giving the updated position about government's policies and initiatives in infrastructure and other sectors to attract foreign direct investment, was brought out in December 1998. e)IPP Division took the lead in sponsoring a special supplement on the IT industry in India which appeared in the 'Financial Times', London on 2 December, 1998. This helped to project the outcome of the work of the National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development and also the IT policies announced by the various State governments.</p><p>Agreements The Ministry participated in the negotiations for drawing up of bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements that were held in respect of a number of countries. Such agreements were signed during the year with Turkey, Mauritius Bulgaria, Indonesia, Morocco and Zimbabwe. The Ministry also participated in the negotiations relating to bilateral Civil Aviation matters with other countries. The Ministry provided legal inputs, as required, and also tendered advice based on the need for increased civil aviation links particularly with our neighbouring regions to evolve in consonance with the initiatives being taken on the foreign policy front.

These covered issues of longer term relevance to broad foreign policy objectives. The Division prepared analytical position papers for Ministry's interaction with other agencies. The Division continued to serve as a nodal point for interaction with Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the University Grants Commission (UGC) and its affiliates and the Area Study Centres (ASC) located in various universities and specialising in research on various regions of the world.</p><p>The Division extended financial assistance to various academic institutions/think tanks located in different parts of the country for holding conferences, seminars, preparation of research papers, exchange of scholars and support for Track-II programmes on issues related to India's external relations and security.</p><p>The subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects covered Nationalism in Russia and Central Asian Republics, Indo-China Workshop on Nation Building, Air Transport and Tourism, Indo-Japan Relations, Japan-South Asia Cooperation in the post Cold War Years, Vietnam Today and Indo-Vietnam Relations, 50 Years of Republic of Korea: Indo-Korea Relations. Support was also provided for Indian scholars and experts attending seminars, conferences in Turkey, China, Guyana and the CICA (Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia) Colloquium in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The Centre for Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, USA is also given an annual; recurring grant by the Division. As part of its interactive functions, the Division took the initiative in promoting exchanges with official and non-official visiting experts and projected India's views and perceptions on important issues.</p><p>The Division continued to edit and publish the Annual Report of the Ministry. The Report served as a compendium of India's interaction with the rest of the world in the political, economic and cultural fields, including the views of the government on various facets of international relations. The Division rendered all possible assistance to the territorial divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific information or document on international relations was required. The Research Wing examined the depiction of India's international boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through Indian Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The Division also scrutinised foreign publications containing maps depicting India's external boundaries before these were imported into the county and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such matters. It coordinated the supply of map- sheets to various Government and semi-Government agencies for use in their official work with the Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The Research Wing dealt with requests from research scholars for access to the records of the Ministry.</p><p>In support of research, the Ministry's Library has modern information technology equipment and rich resource materials, with over one hundred thousand books and a large collection of maps, microfilms and official documents. The Library receives and maintains 600 periodical titles. It has in-house computer systems with fifteen terminals, two of which support data entry and retrieval in Hindi. It also has CD-ROM work station and has CD-ROM databases on foreign affairs and current affairs. The Library is also equipped with a Colour Scanner (with OCR capability as well as facility for storage and retrieval of images), a microfilm/fiche reader printer, a plain paper photocopier, as well as a VTR and colour monitor and a laser printer with Desk Top Publishing (DTP) software. This has enabled better presentation of publications and documents of the Division. The Library has internet and E-mail facilities. These are being gradually made available to visiting users who include former Foreign Service officers.</p><p>Documentation/bibliographic services as well as other library operations and services have been computerised, using an integrated library software package. Information on all books, maps, documents and selected periodical articles received in the Library since 1986, and pre-1986 publications in active use, are available on-line through each terminal in the Library as well as in the Ministry's headquarters in South Block and in Akbar Bhavan through network in operation in these buildings. Library information can also be accessed on-line through remote 'login' via dial-up mode by eligible users. All new documents received in the Library - books, maps, microfilms, selected articles from periodicals - are being fed into the in-house computer system to create a database on foreign affairs.</p><p>Using this database and CD-ROM Databases, the Library provides Current Awareness Service and Bibliographical and Reference Services. In addition, the Library regularly issues 'Foreign Affairs Documentation Bulletin' - monthly list of selected periodicals, articles many with abstracts, 'Recent Additions' - an annotated monthly list of publications added to the Library, and fortnightly 'Chronicle of Events'. Library users including research scholars are welcome to access the on-line computer-based information in the Library in different databases, including CD-ROM Databases, and the Foreign Affairs Information Retrieval System (FAIRS).

This completed the first phase of the project of compiling a comprehensive compendium of India's Bilateral Treaties and Agreements since independence. Subsequent phase of the project envisages publication of annual volumes, the first volume of which covering 1991 has been issued during this year. There are about seven lakh files, both classified and unclassified, lying in the Record Management Section of the Ministry. We have been sending old files for reviewing regularly to the concerned officers for taking a decision regarding retention or otherwise of these files. About 4000 files which were no longer required have been destroyed by burning. About 499 files have been transferred to the National Archives of India. uu</p><p>USA INDIA CHINA RUSSIA JAPAN VIETNAM KOREA GUYANA TURKEY KAZAKHSTAN</p><p>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report</p><p>1998<br>13</p><p>External Publicity<br>Projection of India abroad, including its foreign policy, is the essential function of the External Publicity (XP) Division. It involves the dissemination of news about developments pertaining to India and India's views and concerns on national and international issues. Opinion makers are kept informed about developments in India in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres with particular reference to issues having a bearing on India's external relations and foreign policy. Following the nuclear tests by India in May 1998, this function became dominant and was effectively handled.</p><p>The External Publicity Division and Missions/Posts abroad worked in unison to enlarge areas of positive perception about the country while attempting to build greater awareness and understanding of its policies and values. Some focus areas included: India's millennial history and its civilisation; its diverse and profound religious and philosophical traditions; its democratic and secular political culture and institutions, its pluralistic, tolerant and accommodative social ethos; its wide experience in nation building; its impressive economic, scientific and technological achievements, its colossal market potential and, its strategic perceptions including its evolving nuclear policy. Audio visual and print material was used to achieve these objectives.</p><p>In its key function as the office of the Official Spokesman of the Government of India on all matters pertaining to India's external affairs, the External Publicity Division strove to orient the domestic and international media on a day to day basis on India's foreign policy perspectives and on topical issues,particularly the nuclear policy through regular briefings and public relations efforts. Over 200 Press Releases and Statements were issued by the Division the year, upto November 1998, and distributed amongst Indian and foreign media, Indian missions abroad, foreign missions in India and also made available on the MEA internet website. The 'Foreign Affairs Record', a compilation of all press releases, visits, agreements and significant diplomatic developments, was brought out on a monthly basis. The Division's news dissemination function also included news bulletins sent out to India's Missions/Posts abroad on a twice - daily basis; a newspaper clipping service on external affairs coverage from the national media for Indian Missions and for senior officials of the Ministry; and, news on the Ministry's internet website.</p><p>Eight documentaries were aquired from Surabhi on Education, Art, Music, Dance, Handicrafts, Development and Culture for non-commercial publicity through our Missions/ Posts abroad. Copies of these films were sent to our Missions/ Posts abroad as part of our publicity exercise. Further, documentaries on Progressive Indian Women; India in Space; The North-East; The Changing Face of Indian Countryside; Flute; Confluences in North Indian Music; New Frontiers of Information Era; The Indian Experience; A Nation Celebrates; The Empire Writes Back; The Rooted Imagination; Dreaming Young Dreaming Global; Transition Times; Indian Achievements in Agricultural Sciences and Technology; Buddhist Heritage of Ladakh; The Nuclear Issue; Saarc- 10th Summit in Colombo; Fragrance of Love; Traditional Heritage of India; and, The Victoria Memorial were commissioned and are at various stages of completion.

XP Division extended its support and cooperation for festivals organised abroad. These included, inter-alia, Film Festivals in Houston, Tokyo, St.Denis, Copenhagen, Tripoli, Malta, Damascus, and the Eager University Film Festival in Budapest. Indian Film Festivals in 23 other Missions were organised during the golden jubilee celebrations of India's Independence. Further, XP division contributed to 35 other film festivals organised by various missions/posts abroad. Apart from this, the division assisted the Directorate of Film Festivals in organising Film Festivals abroad under its aegis.</p><p>54 prints of eight feature films based on the Freedom Struggle namely: Gandhi, Sardar, Nehru, Garam Hawa, Tamas, 22nd June 1897, Making of the Mahatma and Train to Pakistan were acquired, sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic and sent to missions abroad for film festivals. 175 prints of various feature films in 16/35mm format were sub-titled in English, French, Spanish and Arabic languages through NFDC, Mumbai.</p><p>Activity on the Photo Publicity side also increased substantially. Collections of large size photographs were sent to Missions abroad for special photo exhibitions in connection with the 50th anniversary of Indians Independence. On the occasion of the Independence Day, 1500 prints were sent to various missions and posts abroad for special supplements in local newspapers. Cataloging, computerisation and inventor formation of the entire stock of feature films, documentary films, U-Matic/Betacam cassettes, video programmes, photographs and transparencies was completed during the year. Active assistance was provided to our Missions/Posts abroad in promoting their publicity effort by providing them with tourist literature, photographs and pamphlets.</p><p>The foreign media continued to show a keen interest in India through visits by media delegations and TV teams. The entry of India into the 'Nuclear Club' in May 1998, further stimulated incoming media visits. The XP Division provided assistance to them, including briefing them, as well as seeking appointments with senior Ministers, senior officials, academicians, representatives of business houses and chambers of commerce. This Division also invited foreign media persons to facilitate foreign journalists in gaining a first hand experience of India. In 1998, 120 journalists, individually or as part of media and TV delegations, visited India from the Phillipines, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Nepal, Malaysia, Turkey, Pakistan , China, Kenya, Mexico, UAE, USA, Sri Lanka, Senegal, Cyprus, South Africa, Czechlovakia, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco, Kyrgyztan, Uzbekistan, Croatia, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. These visits generated extensive coverage on India in the foreign media and in creating a better understanding of our country.</p><p>Another important job handled by this Division was making media arrangements for delegations accompanying the Heads of State or Government on visits to India. This assistance entailed facilitating media coverage, arranging press briefings and providing other logistical arrangements. During the year, VVIP visits were received from France, Canada, Maldives, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Belarus, Belgium, Chile and Switzerland. Visits from South Africa, Russia, Thailand and Sri Lanka are expected by the end of the year. The XP Division also handled all logistical arrangements for Indian media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and the Prime Minister on their state visits abroad to Peru, Brazil, USA, Nepal, Germany, Luxembourg Portugal, Turkey, Cairo (G-15 Summit), Colombo (SAARC Summit), Durban (NAM Summit), Namibia, Oman, Mauritius, Jamaica (G-15), Trinidad and Tobago and Morocco. The division effectively contributed during these visits by setting up and operating media centres and looking after all logistical arrangements for the Indian media - locally based and travelling with the VVIPs.</p><p>One of the important jobs entrusted to this Division is the clearance of documentary proposals received from documentary makers all over the world. Out of over 360 proposals received, 85 per cent were cleared, while others were awaiting approvals from central and state governments.</p><p>There are more than 300 foreign journalists of various foreign news agencies and organisations based in India. An important aspect of this Division's work has been to provide accreditation facilities and give clearances for renewal of visas to these journalists. With more and more news agencies setting up bureau offices in India, work related to this aspect increased this year, especially following the nuclear tests. A number of new Bureau were opened during the year.</p><p>The supply of books, magazines, journals and other periodicals on a wide range of issues for use in the Missions' libraries and for distribution to local dignitaries abroad, opinion makers and academic institutions continued during the year. Based on the feedback received from various targetted groups, the Division supplied material suitable to their requirements. More than fifty different books were purchased for distribution to our Missions/Posts, including the Booker Prize Winner, "God of Small Things", a highly valued photographic book by Lindsay Hebberd on the Cultural and Socio-economic spectrum of India- "Cultural Portraits", "Indian Experience" on the diverse aspects of India, a foreign publication on India, "India Unveiled", "India 2020: A Vision for new Millennium" by eminent scientist APJ Abdul Kalam, a collection of writings on India by a team of accomplished journalists of international news agencies titled 'Assignment India', and others including some specifically meant for children.</p><p>The two important publications of External Publicity Division in Coffee table book format, viz. "India Continuity in Change" and "India: A Dynamic Democracy", were distributed to our missions abroad. The reprinting of the revised publicaiton "India A Dynamic Democracy" in English was completed and 6000 copies were distributed to our Missions/Posts abroad for publicity purposes. In view of the rising demand, their publication was commissioned in other languages like French, German, Russian, Arabic and Spanish. The Division continued to assist ICCR and UN/ITEC Divisions in the production of their publications.</p><p>Over Fifty five thousand copies of India Perspectives, a prestigious monthly magazine published by the XP Division in ten different languages, were distributed through Indian Missions and Posts abroad. The magazine was also made available on the MEA website to cover a wider audience. Besides highlighting India's historical and cultural heritage, the journal has been focussing on the impressive progress made by India in all facets of life, achievements in the area of Science and Technology and the steps taken to globalise the country's economy. A special issue of this magazine on Nuclear India was brought out in the month of September 1998 to supplement the efforts of projecting India's viewpoint on the nuclear issue.</p><p>The international media was monitored using inputs from Missions abroad. Negative and adverse reports in the international media on India' s nuclear tests were rebutted by the Indian missions through interviews/letters in influential papers and appearances on TV channels as well as other engagements. Compilations of reportage in the international media, on the nuclear and other relevant issues were circulated in the Ministry; to the Indian media; and to Indian Missions abroad. The comments by foreign journalists, political leaders and intellectuals of international repute highlighting India's point of view were circulated widely and also put up on the MEA's internet website.</p><p>Special supplements were brought out in 'The New York Times' and 'The Washington Post' containing commissioned articles on India's nuclear policy by eminent personalities. Missions abroad also brought out supplements in the local papers throughout the world on Independence Day and Republic Day. India's nuclear policy, foreign policy issues, India's economy, culture, science and technology achievements were some of the focus areas. A section on India's nuclear policy was opened on MEA's website after the nuclear tests and this was appreciated by many international agencies and commended by 'The Los Angeles Times', BBC and many others. The fact that information on the Ministry's website at www.indiagov.org and www.meadev.gov.in was well received could be gauged from the 2.2 million hits received by the site per month. Action has been initiated to enhance the role of the website through its technical enhancement as well as substantive enrichment and updating.</p></td></tr><tr><th style="text-align: left;">1999</th></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;"><p>Protocol</p><p>State Visits by Heads of State / Government/ Vice Presidents/ Crown Prince to India</p><p>1.H.

Apart from constituting a public service, the issue of a passport also has a bearing on a vital component of India's foreign policy viz., the export of Indian manpower, expertise and technology abroad. The large Indian community resident abroad constitutes a dynamic link between India and the rest of the world. In an era in which the international scene has witnessed momentous changes, the people of Indian origin abroad have played a significant role in promoting India's interests and in contributing towards the strengthening of India's political and economic relations with their respective countries of adoption.</p><p>Passport Services Efforts to fulfil the Government's commitments under the Citizens' Charter were taken forward in 1998 through various measures aimed at providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport Offices. A new Passport Office at Pune and three new Passport Collection Centres at Surat, Gangtok and Aurangabad were opened during the year. The Passport Rules were amended to allow for sixty page (Jumbo) passport booklets which is very convenient to frequent travellers in this increasingly globalising world. For less frequent travellers a passport with validity upto 20 years has been introduced.</p><p>Separate passports for minors were also introduced to bring the practice in India in line with that prevalent internationally. This has been done to eliminate the chances of inconvenience to the passport holder when they approach some foreign Missions for visas. Some of the countries which insist on a separate passport for children before giving them visa are USA, UK, Canada, Japan and almost all European countries.</p><p>Special efforts were made to reduce the pendency of applications in various Passport Offices for which standard monitoring procedures were devised and regular inspections of the Passport Offices institutionalised. The Annual Passport Officers Conference was held on 8 October, 1998 at which emphasis was placed on the need to effectively redress public grievances. A review of the Passports Act and Rules was initiated and Passport Officers asked to consider introducing the practice of periodical 'Passport Adalats'.</p><p>Extensive measures have been initiated to simplify and streamline various procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous services promptly and efficiently in keeping with our commitment under the Citizens' Charter. Comprehensive instructions liberalizing grant of duplicate passports were issued to various Passport Issuing Authorities.</p><p>From the mid 80s when the Ministry had first launched a project to computerise a few passport offices in a phased manner, already 15 passport offices including those in the metropolitan cities have been comprehensively computerised. Other passport offices are also in the process of being computerised. A proposal for a comprehensive satellite based computer programming and connectivity as well as the creation of a central Processing Cell is being fromulated. MEA also went through a process of open tendering and bids for completely overhauling the existing system and to take advantage of the latest available technology.</p><p>However, due to certain technicalities the bids had to be returned in September 1998. It was decided thereafter to appoint Department of Electronics as a consultant for preparing a fresh tender document especially with regard to the technical specifications for the project. The report has been received and the tender documents are expected to be finalised and issued shortly. It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house the Passport Offices in Government owned properties. MEA has acquired plots of land/built-up properties in various cities in India to this effect. We have 28 Passport Offices in India of which five Passport Offices at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Cochin and Kozhikode are already operating from Government buildings.</p><p>Construction work is in progress at 6 places viz. Ahmedabad for office and residential complex; Cochin (residential complex), Hyderabad (Office complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji and Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been initiated at another nine places i.e. Banagalore, Chennai, Lucknow, Jaipur, Trivandram, Chandigarh, Trichy, Jammu and Calcutta.</p><p>The number of applications received during the year for grant of passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. continued to rise in keeping with the overall climate of liberalisation and increased travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 22,22,786 fresh passports were issued and 3,08,214 miscellaneous services rendered. Detailed figures of receipts of passports issued/various services rendered including the revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices are at Appendix IV.</p><p>PIO Card The six million Indian citizens and over twenty million People of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have collectively evolved into a major instrument for the furtherance of India's foreign policy. Recognising their significant role in the shaping of the country's destiny, Government announced the introduction of a PIO Card for Persons of Indian Origin settled in countries to be specified by Government which would, besides introducing a visa free regime, also confer some special economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits. A user-friendly software has also been developed which will enable the Indian Missions abroad to compile and maintain a uniform database on the NRIs/PIOs.</p><p>Consular Services As part of the drive towards modernisation of consular services, new secure visa stickers were introduced at all the Indian diplomatic Missions and Posts abroad from 1 August, 1998. In keeping with ICAO recommendations, efforts are continuing to introduce more secure and machine readable passports and visas. There was renewed emphasis on the need to cater to the consular needs of Overseas Indians and to render them efficient and timely assistance through the Indian diplomatic Missions abroad. Problems encountered by Non-Resident Indians/workers especially in the Gulf countries, including disputes with their employers/sponsors were sought to be promptly redressed. Government maintained regular contact with the Governments of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism of the Joint Commission, with the objective of resolving consular problems and ameliorating the condition of Indian workers in those countries.</p><p>In cases of deaths of Indians abroad immediate assistance was arranged by our Missions and Posts for completing the formalities for early despatch of the mortal remains while maintaining liaison with the local and Indian authorities as well as the relatives of the deceased. In several countries various amnesty schemes were announced for regularising the stay of illegal immigrants in those countries. Special drives were launched to cater to the specific requirements of affected Indian nationals by way of expeditious issue of Emergency Certificates/travel documents and other requisite assistance. During the year, 9383 Indians were arrested abroad and 4783 deaths of Indian abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary of the consular data for the year 1998 is at Annexure 'B'.</p><p>Visas India's more than 150 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to over 1.64 million foreigners during 1998. The procedure for grant of visa by our Missions and Posts is user friendly, quick and efficient. Many Missions and Posts give visas either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas within 48 hours. To keep pace with increasing automation, the Consular Wing in HCI London has been computerised which has reduced the time spent by applicants in the queues as well as at the counter. Computerisation has also speeded up the processing of application for visas. The Ministry is actively considering computerisation of some other Consular Wings in North America where the volume of services rendered is high.</p><p>Bilateral Agreements As part of the global endeavour to counter terrorism, and acknowledging the growing international dimensions of crime, consular agreements and institutional mechanisms were negotiated with several countries. These negotiations included over two dozen Extradition Treaties, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties in Criminal and Civil Matters as well as Consular Conventions. During the visit of Russian Prime Minister to India in December, 1998 an Extradition Treaty, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters and Consular Convention were signed. Official and technical level consultations were held with Bulgaria and Tunisia for finalising bilateral Extradition Treaties. While certain issues still remained to be sorted out with Bulgaria, an Extradition Treaty draft has been finalised and initialled with Tunisia on February 9, 1999.</p><p>With France and UAE the Extradition Treaties were initialled. However, as subsequently some changes have been suggested by both sides the two treaties are being further negotiated. The Ministry is currently addressing several requests for extradition and other legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal and civil and commercial charges. The request for extradition emanates from our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or extradition arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year six fresh requests were processed in addition to the ongoing cases.</p><p>During the year, 2,36,120 documents were accorded consular attestation in CPV Division of which 1,47,069 were commercial documents. The same day service rendered is efficient and courteous and without any charge. Renovation of Patiala House CPV Division is located in the Patiala House which is visited by a large number of applicants who come for attestation of documents as well as by diplomats and staff of foreign Missions in New Delhi. Over the years the building had become dilapidated and shabby in appearance. A project for comprehensive renovation of the exterior as well as interior of the building has been undertaken during the year. The work is expected to be completed by the end of March 1999.</p><p>Central Passport Organisation The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) man the 28 passport offices and 12 existing Passport Collection Centres. The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1595 with 145 officers and 1450 non-gazetted staff. During the year the All India Passport Employees Association was recognised by the Government. One of the major demands of the employees is for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review has been formulated during the year and is being processed.</p><p>As the volume of work as well as the network of Passport Offices and Passport Collection Centres has been growing over the years, the Ministry is considering a proposal to create a Central Passport Authority with a view to grant greater autonomy to the Passport Offices to achieve greater efficiency and higher productivity.</p><p>Vision Our goal is to set up a clean, transparent and efficient passport issuing service which the MEA can be justifiably proud of and which the general public can be genuinely satisfied about. The system should also be sensitive and responsive to the special needs of the public. uu</p><p>INDIA USA CANADA UNITED KINGDOM JAPAN PERU CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC MALI RUSSIA BULGARIA TUNISIA FRANCE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</p><p>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report</p><p>1998<br>16</p><p>Administration and Organisation<br>Following the general elections in February/March 1998, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee assumed charge of the office of Prime Minister on March 18, 1998, with the additional charge of the Ministry of External Affairs. Ms Vasundhara Raje assumed charge as the Minister of State for External Affairs on March 19, 1998. Shri Jaswant Singh took over as the External Affairs Minister on December 5, 1998.</p><p>At present the Government of India has 157 Resident Diplomatic Missions/Posts and other offices. Resident Missions would be opened in Armenia(Yerevan) and Azerbaijan (Baku) very shortly. Our Resident Mission at Fiji (Suva) is being re- opened shortly. The total strength of the IFS (A), IFS (B), Interpreter and L&amp;T Cadres of the Ministry is 3717 (Appendix I). This figure remains unchanged from that of 1997- 98.</p><p>A table indicating the appointments to various posts in the Ministry made in 1998-99, including vacancies filled against reservations is at Appendix II. The extent of language proficiency in the Ministry can be judged from the list of officers proficient in various foreign languages at Appendix III. Administrative procedures have been streamlined during the period under review. Following the Pay Commission recommendations refixing the pay and allowances of officials and pensioners, the Pension Section has been revamped and most pension-related dues have been dealt with. Procedures have been streamlined by empowering the Pension Section to deal with all pension related payments as well, i.e. delinking pension payments from the Cash Section. The main activities undertaken by this Division during the year 1998-99 are detailed in succeeding paras.</p><p>The Ministry has drawn up a long-term property acquisition plan beginning from 1995-96. Accordingly, financial provision to the tune of Rs. 75 crores for the year 1998-99 was provided under the Capital Outlay Budget heads 4059 and 4216. The Establishment Division during the year under review made all-out efforts to purchase built-up properties, complete construction projects for chanceries and residences and pursued vigorously proposals for repairs and maintenance of GOI properties abroad.</p><p>Presently, proposals for purchase of built-up properties, in Tehran, Budapest and Paramaribo are under active consideration and are expected to materialise in the current financial year. MEA has undertaken construction projects after acquiring plots of land either on reciprocal basis or on purchase basis in a number of countries. Currently, the project for construction of Chancery and Embassy Residence in Abu Dhabi is in full swing. The construction of Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture in Mauritius is likely to be completed by the first half of 1999. The Berlin project for construction of Chancery-cum-residential complex is at an advanced stage and construction is expected to start in March 1999.</p><p>All preparatory ground work including approval of design have been completed. Selection of the contractor is in hand. Other projects on the anvil are Doha, Muscat, Dhaka, Islamabad and Brasilia. As a result of concerted efforts to this end Govt. of India now owns 73 Chanceries, 77 Embassy Residences and over 600 other residences for officials.</p><p>In order to ensure the proper up-keep of GOI owned properties, the major repairs/renovations are also undertaken by the Establishment Division in consultation with the Missions concerned. Currently, the proposals for renovations and redevelopment of GOI properties in Singapore, Kyiv, Moscow and London are in hand.</p><p>Establishment Division is also actively undertaking construction projects in India, including the construction of Videsh Bhawan, Foreign Service Institute, Residential complex for officers in Chanakyapuri and ICCR in Calcutta. Additionally, in line with the Ministry's policy to house RPOs in our own buildings, efforts are being made to acquire land and start construction of Passport Offices and residences for the Passport office personnel. Briefly, land has already been acquired in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Cochin, Goa, Kozhikode, Lucknow. Construction work is in progress in Ahmedabad, Cochin, and Kozhikode. In Chennai and Hyderabad semi-built properties have been purchased.</p><p>Ministry has made considerable progress towards modernisation of office facilities to provide an efficient working environment for its officers and staff, which is also looked after by the Establishment Division. The use of E.Mail, Internet and PCs has become a common feature. With a view to rationalise the fixation of Foreign Allowance for its officials posted in Missions abroad, Ministry introduced indexation scheme from 1.1.98. The indexation scheme has made the whole process of fixation of FA more realistic and objective.</p><p>Foreign allowance of almost all Missions/Posts were revised w.e.f. 1 April, 1998 after the first review of indexation.</p></td></tr><tr><th style="text-align: left;">1999</th></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;"><p>Foreign Service Institute</p><p>The Foreign Service Institute further expanded its activities during 1998-99.</p><p>While all the regular programmes were continued, there was a significant increase in the scope and content of each course. The following courses were held in the year under report :</p><p>(i)Professional Course in Diplomacy and International Relations for Indian Foreign Service Probationers (1997 batch);</p><p>(ii)Basic Professional Course for IFS(B) personnel posted abroad;</p><p>(iii)Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats;</p><p>(iv)Familiarization Programme for Resident Foreign Diplomats;</p><p>(v)Language Courses; and</p><p>(vi)Orientation Course for Non-MEA officers. The most important part of FSI's work is the basic Course on Diplomacy and International Relations conducted for the Probationers of the Indian Foreign Service. The training programme for the 1997 batch of IFS Probationers which started in January 1998 continued upto 1 January, 1999. The basic objective of this course was to provide comprehensive training to the young IFS Officers, not only in traditional areas of diplomacy, international relations, political reporting and protocol but also in several related fields that are growing in importance such as national and international security, the international economic environment, management challenges in the changing global scenario and investment promotion.</p><p>The training programme for the 1997 batch of IFS Probationers comprised of 26 modules which dealt with important areas of work related to foreign policy and diplomacy. The most comprehensive module related to India's foreign policy, covering almost every aspect of our external relations.</p><p>In keeping with the special emphasis in recent years on economic diplomacy, the module on 'International Economic Relations and Commercial Diplomacy' was strengthened, with the focus on India's economic reforms, the international economic environment, the functions of commercial representatives in Indian missions abroad, role of Commercial Counsellors in investment promotion, commercial negotiations, management challenges in the changing global scenario and the international finance and capital markets etc.</p><p>The module entitled "New Areas of International Relations" highlighted some non- traditional areas of diplomacy, such as Environment, Energy, Refugees, Narcotics, Terrorism and Human Rights.</p><p>The module on "Defence &amp; Security" apart from focusing on vital security issues like nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control, also covered India's defence policy, the state of our armed forces, developments in defence technology and the security of our border areas.</p><p>An additional module on "Special Diplomatic Skills" emphasised negotiating skills, communication skills, use of Information Technology, development of leadership skills and "espirit de corps".</p><p>Apart from these modules, there was a good deal of emphasis on field visits to acquaint the probationers with the ground situation in important areas of the country such as the North-East, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and the Indo-Tibetan border. The Probationers were also attached with the armed forces for training. The IFS Probationers were given extensive briefing on the current state of Science &amp; Technology in India including its foreign policy ramification at the National Institution of Advanced Studies, Bangalore. They also visited the National Hydrographic Institute and the Survey of India establishments in Dehradun for briefing on border demarcation on land and sea.</p><p>Continuing with the "SAARC Darshan" programme introduced last year, Nepal and Sri Lanka were visited by the IFS Probationers for a period of around one week each.</p><p>Six Basic Professional courses (BPCs) were held, which was two more than the previous year. The course is conducted for officials in the Ministry of External Affairs upto the rank of Section Officers under orders of posting abroad or about to be posted abroad. Emphasis is given during this course for training/exposure to Mission's administration, establishment and finance; accounts, passports, visas and consular work. Looking at the needs of the participants, the BPC has been bifurcated into two groups.</p><p>Separate training programmes are conducted for SOs/Assistants from those of UDCs/LDCs. The focus of the two courses is different. Apart from the above mentioned modules, SOs and Assistants are exposed to commercial work in Missions and also to Indian Foreign Policy and Information work. UDCs/LDCs are trained on the basics of Accountancy, Administration, Establishment and Consular Matters. Emphasis is also on O&amp;M. Thus, the course content has been further strengthened during the year under report so that all officials posted in Missions abroad have a larger perspective and make more effective contribution towards the total team effort of the mission.</p><p>The Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats (PCFD) has been organised by the FSI from 1992 onwards. During 1998-99, a total of four PCFDs have been held. The PCFD is designed to cover areas felt most relevant to the training needs of the foreign diplomats who attend. Some of the basic areas covered relate to diplomacy, international relations, regional focus on specific regions, international law and international organizations, international economic relations and commercial diplomacy, defence and security, diplomatic practice and protocol, representational skills and cultural diplomacy. As part of the course, the foreign diplomats are also taken on study tours to various centres of economic, industrial and cultural importance in the country so as to expose them to India's capabilities and achievements in diverse fields.</p><p>Interest in the PCFDs has been growing. From April 1998 to December 1998, a total of 57 foreign diplomats from 38 countries, covering virtually every part of the developing world, have attended the course. Since 1992, a total of 442 diplomats from 92 countries have participated.</p><p>The Institute organised Orientation Programmes for Non-MEA officers proceeding on posting to our missions abroad. The programmes were designed to acquaint the officers with the general functioning of our missions, the financial, establishment and administrative rules applicable as well as protocol matters. A fully functional Computer Lab has been opened in the Foreign Service Institute to train all MEA personnel in various aspects of use of modern day information technology. This will help allow all MEA personnel access to this latest and important branch of technology.</p><p>The Foreign Service Institute has also been functioning as a think tank of important issues relating to India's external relations. The institute maintains continuous interaction with experts in the fields of international relations, diplomacy, economics, defence and security. The FSI continues to maintain contacts with its counterpart institutes. The Executive Director of the Institute of Foreign Affairs of Nepal visited the FSI in November 1998. Experiences between the two Institutes were exchanged and it was agreed to strengthen institutional linkages.</p><p>In connection with the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of India's Independence, the FSI brought out a book on "Indian Foreign Policy : Agenda for the 21st Century", in two volumes which is a compilation of articles by leading scholars and specialists. The book was presented to the Hon'ble President of India on July 15, 1998. The two volumes are intended to provide a perspective on India's foreign policy during the past 50 years as well as a projection of the challenges that lie ahead for India in the 21st century.</p><p>The 21st Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats was held from 11 January, 1999 to 12 February, 1999 and the number of diplomats from developing countries who participated in the course was 22. 15 Indian Foreign Service Probationers of the 1998 batch joined FSI on 4 January, 1998 for a one-year training programme with the Institute. uu</p><p>INDIA<br>USA NEPAL SRI LANKA</p><p>Date : 1999<br>NIL<br>Ministry of External Affairs<br>Annual Report</p><p>1998<br>18</p><p>Implementation of Official Language Policy and Propagation of Hindi Abroad</p><p>The Ministry is making every endeavour to increase the progressive use of Hindi and its propagation in India and abroad. Documents like bilateral treaties, Agreements, Memorandum of Understanding, Credentials, Speeches of President, PAC paras, Annual Report of the Ministry, Parliament Questions and other documents submitted to both the Houses are issued bilingually.</p><p>During the Golden Jubilee Year of India's Independence, Ministry made special efforts for the propagation of Hindi abroad. Ministry sent Hindi books and CD ROMs like 'Learn Hindi', 'Sangya', 'Sarvanaams', 'Visheshan' and 'Panchtantra Ki Kahaniya', to be gifted in countries with a large Hindi Speaking resident population. The books were primarily on India's freedom struggle, our achievements in the last 50 years and other related subjects. These books were gifted to organisations engaged in the propagation of Hindi abroad.</p><p>In order to promote bilingualism and the use of Hindi and other Indian languages and to provide basic infra-structural facilities for Hindi typing, Leap Office Software developed by C-DAC, Pune has been purchased and sent to 60 Missions. Efforts are on to equip each Mission with at least one Leap Hindi Software. In pursuance of the decisions taken at the World Hindi Conference in 1998, efforts are being made to establish a 'Permanent Secretariat of Hindi' in Mauritius. It would liaise with Universities and Institutions promoting Hindi all over the world at government and non- governmental levels and also act as a catalyst in the furthering of Hindi as a language of culture, civilisation and communication at the international level.</p><p>It has been decided to organise the 6th World Hindi Conference in 1999 since this is the Golden Jubilee Year of proclamation of Hindi as the Official Language of the Union of India. Preparatory activities are underway with regard to the organisation of the Conference. The dates and venue of the Conference are being finalised in consultation with the organisers. Government of India has established a Co-ordination Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State for External Affairs and budget provisions have also been made for this purpose.</p><p>The Conference would strive to highlight the modern role of Hindi as a language of education, communication and administration and to disseminate information on developments in the fields of publication and advancement made in computer technology for Hindi and other Indian Languages. During the Conference, Government of India will bring out a souvenir. This souvenir will be educative as well as informative. During the Conference, a book exhibition will be organised wherein various books on Hindi literature, science and technology etc. will be displayed. An exhibition on computer software written in Hindi will also be organised. Cultural and dance troupes will also be sent. During this Conference, eminent Hindi Scholars from all over the world will be honoured. 50 slots were allocated to foreign nationals for learning Hindi at Kendriya Hindi Sansthan, Agra this year. Hindi teachers were appointed in Indian Missions abroad under a special Ministry scheme to teach Hindi to the children of India- based Embassy officials.</p><p>In accordance with the recommendation of the Hindi Advisory Committee of the Ministry, two officials were detailed to New York during the UNGA Session to assist those members of the Indian delegation who wished to communicate in Hindi.</p><p>This year, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee under the Chairmanship of HCI, London has been formed in London to monitor over the progress made in the implementation of Official Language Policy of GOI in the various offices of Govt. of India
