<br></p></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify">India's traditional foreign policy of Non-alignment, peace and  
friendship with all countries, particularly its neighbours, was  
pursued with renewed vigour during the year despite pre- 
occupation with such important internal developments as the  
Punjab and Assam accords. We have welcomed and encouraged every  
sign of improvement in the international political climate, both  
globally and regionally. On the crucial global issue of  
disarmament, the resumption of a dialogue at the Summit level  
between the USA and USSR, provided it is followed by meaningful  
measures, could lead to a halt and reversal of the disturbing  
trend of the last few years towards a new Cold War. In South  
Asia, the adoption by the Dhaka Summit of a Declaration and a  
Charter launching the South Asian Association for Regional  
Cooperation has provided an institutional framework for regional  
cooperation among the countries of the sub-continent. 
<br> 
<br>   The recognition at the Geneva Summit between US President  
Reagan and Soviet Party Leader Gorbachev that "a nuclear war  
cannot be won and must never be fought", is an acknowledgement of  
the strong desire of world public opinion of the need to curb the  
arms race and acknowledgement of the primary responsibility of  
the nuclear powers to take meaningful steps towards disarmament.  
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in his address to the 40th  
Anniversary Commemorative Session of the United Nations in New  
York had stressed "the need to cure the world of the insanity of  
the nuclear militarism and let man's creative genius be enlisted  
on behalf of enrichment and not destruction." He reiterated the  
objectives of the Delhi Declaration issued by the Six Nation  
Summit in January 1985 and joined the leaders of Argentina,  
Greece, Mexico, Sweden and Tanzania in urging, a twelve-month  
suspension of all nuclear weapon tests, offering facilities for  
the process of verification. His meetings with the US and Soviet  
leaders provided an occasion to re-emphasise the importance India  
attaches to disarmament, both as a long-standing objective of our  
foreign policy and as one of the main aims of the Non-aligned  
Movement. It is, therefore, a source of some satisfaction that  
the Soviet Union has extended by three months its offer of a  
moratorium on tests and also put forward proposals, to which the  
US side has responded, for the limitation, reduction and ultimate  
elimination of nuclear weapons under a time bound programme. 
 
<br><br>   The Prime Minister took particularly active steps to establish  
greater understanding with the leaders of other South Asian  
countries. He availed of every opportunity to meet with his South  
Asian counterparts and this has set the stage for improving the  
climate of bilateral relations with each country. 
<br>-iv&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Four meetings with President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan, led to  
his visit to New Delhi on December 17, in which both sides  
announced that they would not attack each other's nuclear  
facilities. They decided on an immediate programme of bilateral  
meetings for removing obstacles to the growth of effective  
cooperation. During his meetings with President Zia, the Prime  
Minister reiterated India's continuing concern regarding  
Pakistan's nuclear programme and the assistance that continued to  
be provided to Sikh extremists from across the border, despite  
high level assurances to the contrary. In pursuance of decisions  
taken by President Zia and our Prime Minister at their meeting on  
17th December, our Finance Minister visited Pakistan in January  
and held talks for expanding economic and commerical cooperation.  
The Defence Secretaries of both sides met to discuss the  
situation in the Siachen Glacier area. The Foreign Secretaries  
also held discussions on a comprehensive draft of a treaty of  
agreement for building lasting peace, friendship and cooperation.  
However, differences on some important aspects persist. 
<br> 
<br>   The Prime Minister held discussions with President Ershad of  
Bangladesh at the time of the Commonwealth Heads of Government  
meeting in Nassau, the Bahamas. It was decided that the  
Irrigation Ministers of the two countries should meet to discuss  
an approach to the solution of the long-standing problem of  
shortages in the Ganga. The visit of the Bangladesh Irrigation  
Minister to New Delhi in November resulted in a Memorandum of  
Understanding being signed with our Minister for Water Resources,  
Shri B. Shankaranand to initiate a joint study of the available  
water resources common to both countries to enable them to find a  
solution to the problem of augmenting the waters of the Ganga at  
Farakka. The Memorandum provided, during the three years period  
of its validity, for a sharing arrangement of the Ganga waters at  
Farakka on the same terms as the previous Memorandum of  
Understanding signed in 1982. The Prime Minister met President  
Ershad again in December at the time of the SAARC Summit. He had  
earlier met with him in June when he flew to Dhaka, accompanied  
by President Jayewardene of Sri Lanka, to express sympathy  
following the cyclone that ravaged the coast of Bangladesh in May  
1985. On both these occasions India's desire to improve the  
quality of the bilateral relationship was conveyed. Our concern  
over the problem of continued illegal immigration from Bangladesh  
into India has also been conveyed to the Bangladesh authorities  
at appropriate levels. 
<br> 
<br>   The unresolved ethnic problem of Sri Lanka and mounting  
reports of killings of Tamils there, continue to be a source of  
deep concern. Contacts have been maintained at the highest level  
to assist in finding an amicable solution. The Sri Lankan  
Government have been left in no doubt, that, in our view,  
attempts to force a military solution of this issue cannot  
succeed. These attempts have resulted in the influx of refugees  
from Sri Lanka increasing to the figure of 124,000. A political  
solution that will enable the refugees to return to their homes 
<br>-v) 
<br> 
<br>with dignity and in safety can alone hold out any prospect of  
resolving the internal crisis in Sri Lanka. 
 
<br><br>India's cooperation with Nepal and Bhutan have continued to  
grow steadily. H.M. the King of Nepal held wide-ranging  
discussions during his visit to Delhi in September. India's  
assistance for developmental projects in Nepal has been  
appreciated. The Treaty of Transit between the two countries,  
which provides for Nepal's access to the sea through India, was  
extended till March 1989. H.M. the King of Bhutan visited Delhi  
in February 1985, and our Prime Minister paid a return visit to  
Thimpu in September. India continued to extend substantial  
assistance to Bhutan for its all-round development. 
<br> 
<br>   Relations with Maldives and with Burma were also strengthened  
during the year, as marked by the visit of the Maldivian  
President, Mr. Gayoom in February 1985, and the recent visit of  
our Prime Minister to Male and the visit of the then Minister of  
State for External Affairs, Shri Khursheed Alam Khan, to Rangoon. 
<br> 
<br>   India has played an active role in the promotion of South  
Asian Regional Cooperation from its inception. The first South  
Asian Summit was held in Dhaka in December, which launched the  
fullfeldged South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  
(SAARC). The Charter of SAARC provides for an annual meeting of  
the Heads of State and Government and a six-monthly meeting of a  
Council of Ministers, the Organisation's highest policy making  
body. It has also been decided to set up a permanent Secretariat  
and the Foreign Ministers are to go into the details regarding  
its location, structure, financing and functions. Ministerial  
meetings are to be convened in 1986 to discuss respectively  
women's participation in SAARC activities and to coordinate the  
stands of SAARC members in the ongoing discussions on the New  
International Economic Order. The Second Summit meeting is  
scheduled to be held in Delhi in November 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   India's bilateral relations with Afghanistan continued to  
improve during the year and the Seventh Session of the Indo- 
Afghan Joint Committee on Economic, Trade and Technical  
Cooperation was held in Delhi at Ministerial level in August.  
India supports a political settlement in Afghanistan based on  
non-interfernce and non-intervention in Afghan affairs and one  
that would take into account the legitimate interests of all the  
countries concerned. 
<br> 
<br>   India viewed with disquiet the continuing augmentation of the  
military presence of the great powers in the Indian Ocean and  
continued to work bilaterally and with the other Non-aligned  
states to counter this trend. India hopes that the littoral  
states would not align themselves with the great powers or offer  
facilities which would invite countervailing reaction. We are  
deeply concerned that, despite the 1971 UN Declaration which  
seeks to transform the Indian Ocean into a Zone of Peace, great  
power rivalry in this region has been intensified by attempts to  
involve littoral and hinterland states in strategic  
configurations involving outside powers and by the 
<br>-vi&gt; 
<br> 
<br>development of new command structures which tengender a further  
arms build-up and provide an interventionist capability of  
external forces. 
<br> 
<br>   With the countries of South East Asia, India's relations have  
been strengthened. There are increasing signs of awareness among  
the ASEAN countries that the differing perceptions in regard to  
Kampuchea should not come in the way of improving the bilateral  
relationship with each of them. This followed the visit of an  
ASEAN delegation, comprising representatives of Malaysia,  
Singapore and Brunei, and was confirmed during the stop-over of  
President Socharto in New Delhi and the visits of the Foreign  
Ministers of Thailand and Malaysia to our country. These visits  
provided opportunities for strengthening bilateral cooperation  
and promoting understanding on regional and international issues. 
<br> 
<br>   With the countries of Indo-China, relations have grown  
steadily as was marked by the Prime Minister's visit to Hanoi and  
the visit of the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of  
Vietnam, Le Duan to New Delhi. The posthumous Award of the Gold  
Star Order-the highest Vietnamese decoration--to Smt. Indira  
Gandhi was not only a personal tribute to an outstanding fighter  
for peace and freedom, but also indicated Vietnamese regard for  
our country. Exchanges in the economic field are on the increase  
with both Vietnam and Laos and medical supplies from India have  
been appreciated in Kampuchea. 
<br> 
<br>   India continues to make efforts to improve relations with the  
People's Republic of China, reiterating that genuine  
normalisation could be achieved only through a just and  
satisfactory solution to the question of the boundary. The  
meeting between the Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier Zhao  
Ziyang in New York provided an occasion to stress the importance  
of a settlement of this issue and set the stage for the sixth  
round of official level talks, during which each side put forward  
its respective position. Both delegations also exchanged views on  
the international situation. A trade protocol was signed in  
November envisaging an increased trade turnover between the two  
countries in 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The Prime Minister's visit to Tokyo marked a further step in  
the friendly relations with Japan. An Agreement on Cooperation in  
the field of Science and Technology, which provides for the  
setting up of a Joint Committee, was concluded. To bring the  
peoples of Japan and India closer to each other, proposed  
Festival of India in Japan in 1987-88 and the Japan Week in India  
would provide the necessary impetus. The exchanges between the  
various circles of the industry and trade of the two countries,  
both private and public, would help the already growing  
cooperation between the two countries in the field of India's  
industrialisation and technology transfer. 
<br> 
<br>   The relations between India and the two Koreas and Mongoli  
have continued to be marked by friendly exchange of visits at  
Various levels. 
<br>-vii&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The relations with Australia and New Zealand have been further  
strengthened. The Australian Foreign Minister came to New Delhi  
and the official level talks held in Australia enabled the two  
countries to exchange their views on international issues. New  
Zealand has re-established its Mission in New Delhi. Prime  
Minister David Lange visited India in April 1985 and held talks  
with our Prime Minister. Secretary (East)'s visits to a number of  
countries in the region promoted exchange of views at the  
official level. 
<br> 
<br>   Consistent with out traditional and age-old ties with the Arab  
world, the year under review saw a continuous exchange of visits  
between Indian and Arab leaders. The Prime Minister visited Egypt  
and Algeria in June 1985 and it is hoped that there would be a  
significant increase in the cooperation between India and Algeria  
in all fields, especially commercial and industrial. The Prime  
Minister paid his first official visit to Oman on 17-18 November  
1985, on the occasion of the 15th Anniversary of Accession to the  
Throne by Sultan Qaboos. The visit to the United Arab Emirates by  
the former Minister of External Affairs, Shri Khursheed Alam  
Khan, and the visit by the External Affairs Minister, Shri Bali  
Ram Bhagat, to Iran, Kuwait and Bahrain helped to boost greater  
economic and trade exchanges between India and these countries  
besides enhancing appreciation of each other's points of view. 
<br> 
<br>   Meetings of the various Joint Commissions set up by India with  
countries of West Asia and the Gulf provided an opportunity for  
discussion of bilateral trade and economic relations which held  
out promise of greater cooperation in the coming years. Every  
effort was made by India to expand the scope of commercial,  
economic and industrial cooperation with the Gulf countries. A  
Labour Agreement was signed between India and Qatar in April 1985  
and it is hoped that this agreement could become a model for  
similar agreements to regularise the conditions of employment of  
Indian workers in the Gulf.

<tr><td><p align="justify">India's support to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian  
people remained steadfast. We helped in convening the meeting of  
the Non-aligned Committee on Palestine which recommended that an  
International Peace Conference under the aegis of the United  
Nations offered the best path to the attainment and exercise of  
the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and to a  
comprehensive and just peace in West Asia. We expressed our  
distress at the Israeli bombing of the PLO headquarters in Tunis. 
<br> 
<br>   India hopes that peace and stability will be restored in  
Lebanon. India stands for a strong, united and Non-aligned  
Lebanon. India was disappointed at the Moroccan Government's  
decision to break off diplomatic relations with India following  
our recognition of the Saharwi Arab Democratic Republic. India,  
on its part, made every effort to explain its position to Morocco  
before announcing the recognition, which was a principled one. 
<br>-viii&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq entered its sixth  
year, despite all efforts, including our own, to bring it to an  
end. 
<br> 
<br>   India continued its policy of strengthening its relations with  
the African countries, South of Sahara in all fields-political,  
economic, cultural and technical. During April 1985, an Extra- 
ordinary Ministerial meeting of the NAM Coordinating Bureau was  
held on Namibia and during this meeting India announced its  
decision to accord full diplomatic status to the SWAPO  
representative in India. In accordance with India's long held  
policy of total opposition to apartheid, India took every  
opportunity to condemn the recialist policies of South Africa and  
called for implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution  
No. 435 calling for independence of Namibia. During the  
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting held in Nassau in  
October 1985, India played a leading role in achieving the  
consensus among the commonwealth members for devising a time- 
bound programme of action against South Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   India did its best to help the drought-affected countries of  
Africa and 100,000 tonnes of wheat was donated to Ethiopia,  
Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition, India announced  
a contribution of Rs. 12 crores to the OAU's Special Emergency  
Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   The passing away of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Governor- 
General of Mauritius, in December was deeply mourned in India.  
The Vice-President, Shri Venkataraman, accompanied by Shri A.P.  
Sharma and Shri G.S. Dhillon attended the funeral. The  
traditional close relations with Mauritius were strengthened  
through the visits of Prime Minister Jugnauth and the Lok Sabha  
Speaker, Dr. Balram Jakhar. 
<br> 
<br>   India's relations with the Soviet Union and the other East  
European countries continued to grow. The prime Minister's visits  
to the Soviet Union provided an opportunity to review Indo-Soviet  
relations at the highest level. This led to the signing of  
important Agreements on Economic, Technical and Scientific  
Cooperation and on Soviet participation in India's industrial  
projects. Trade between the two countries is expected to almost  
double over the next five years as against the preceding five  
years. The Festival of India and the Festival of Soviet Culture  
proposed for 1987 will provide grater understanding of the two  
countries' cultural traditions among the peoples of the two  
countries. There was a similar development of relations between  
India and other East European countries. The Vice-President, Shri  
Venkataraman paid an official visit to Bulgaria, the German  
Democratic Republic and Yugoslavia in November 1985. The Chairman  
of the Council of Ministers of Poland, General jaruzelski paid an  
official visit to new Delhi during the year. During the visit of  
the Hungarian Deputy Premier Faluvegi to India in October, a  
Protocol was signed for cooperation in Science and Technology  
with Hungary. Joint Commission meetings were held during the year  
with East Germany, Poland and Romania to increase the level of  
cooperation in the fields of science and technology as well as in  
the fields of economy and trade. 
<br>-ix&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The West European countries have evinced increasing interest  
in trade and economic relations with India as a result of our  
liberalised import policies and our quest for uptodate technology  
to modernise the economy. A spate of visits by a number of  
delegations at the highest level from West European countries is  
a testimony to the new trend. The pacifist movement which is  
developing in West European countries has also attracted them to  
India which has given the lead in the call for peace and  
disarmament. The Prime Minister's visit to some of the West  
European countries, namely, Britain, France and Holland and the  
visits to India by the British Prime Minister, the Prime  
Ministers of Sweden and Greece, and H.M. the Queen of the  
Netherlands, is indicative of this trend of closer relations  
between India and West Europe. India is also happy to have  
received His Holiness The Pope. The Festival of India, held in  
Paris, has given a new awareness to the people of France of  
India's rich cultural heritage and the potential of its economy. 
 
   <br><br>The Prime Minister's meetings with the U.S. President first in  
June 1985 in Washington and then in October in New York, helped  
in obtaining greater appreciation by the USA of India's policies  
and perspectives. The Prime Minister was accorded the privilege  
of addressing the U.S. Congress. During his stay in Washington he  
also formally inaugurated the massive Festival of India in the  
USA, which will continue till the end of 1986. Following the  
visit, finalisation of procedures for implementing the Memorandum  
of Understanding on the transfer of high technology is expected  
to open new avenues for Indo-US cooperation. India has, however,  
brought home to the USA its concern over the supply of  
sophisticated weapons to Pakistan as well as over the efforts  
being made by that country to acquire a nuclear capability. 
 
 <br><br> The Cmmonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nassau gave an  
opportunity to the Prime Minister to discuss matters of mutual  
interest with the Prime Minister of Canada. Further discussions  
took place when the Canadian Foreign Minister visited New Delhi  
in November 1985. 
 
 <br><br>  Relations with some of the countries of Western Europe and  
North America were complicated by the indulgent attitude adopted  
by some governments towards anti-Indian disruptive elements  
living there. This matter has been taken up persistently with the  
governments concerned and we believe that there is now a better  
appreciation of the dangers of terroristic activity against India  
in these countries. The vast majority of the Indian communities  
in these countries reacted very favourably to the Punjab and  
Assam accords. 
 
  <br><br> A number of important visits between India and Latin American  
and Caribbean countries helped to enhance the relationship  
between India and these countries. Note-worthy in these exchanges  
were the visits of the Presidents of Argentina and Mexico and the  
Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago to India and the visit of  
our Prime Minister to Cuba. Agreements on economic, scientific,  
technical and cultural cooperation were signed between India and  
these countries. The Cuban award of their highest decoration to  
the late Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, posthumously, was  
indicative of the high 
<br>-(x) 
 
<br><br>regard which Cuba has for India and the contribution of Smt.  
Indira Gandhi towards world peace. Another important development  
between India and Cuba was the signing of an agreement for  
cooperation on the utilisation of atomic energy for peaceful  
purposes. India was greatly distressed at the loss of life and  
property in Mexico and Colombia on account of natural disasters. 
 
  <br><br> India expressed deep concern at the continued violence in  
Central America, particularly Nicaragua. We expressed our  
continued support for the efforts of the Contadora Group to work  
out an Act for Peace in the region which would defuse tensions.  
We also welcomed the formation of the "Support Group" comprising  
Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. 
 
 <br><br>  The world economy regrettably continues to be in a state of  
crisis. While both developed and developing countries have faced  
considerable hardships, the real burden has been borne by the  
latter. The developing countries have been badly hit by the  
decreasing global liquidity, hardening conditionality of the  
international financial institutions coupled with depressed  
prices of their commodities for export. Increased protectionism  
by the developed countries has compounded the problem. India,  
with other Non-aligned countries, sought in a number of ways to  
reverse this trend and to strengthen international economic  
cooperation with, however, little success. The proposed  
International Conference on Money and Finance for Development  
with universal participation is nowhere near realization. The  
Bonn Conference of developed countries, while paying lip-service  
to North-South interdependence, took no concrete steps which  
could be of any help to the developing countries. IDA VII found  
no mention. In view of the inadequate response of the developed  
countries, it was only right that increasing attention was paid  
to greater cooperation among the developing countries themselves,  
both among the Group of 77 and the Non-aligned Movement. India's  
keenness to promote cooperation with the countries of Asia and  
Africa has found expression in the Indian Technical and Economic  
Cooperation Programme (ITEC) which covers 60 countries and has an  
enhanced outlay of Rs. 9 crores in 1985-86 as against Rs. 4.46  
lakhs previously. 
 
 <br><br>  The virtual standstill in international economic negotiations  
in UN fora continued in 1985. The Western industrialised  
countries, particularly the United States, remained unwilling to  
enter into serious negotiations in the UN and the North-South  
dialogue is being increasingly confined to the specialised  
economic fora like GATT, IMF and the World Bank. They tended to  
use the United Nations only as a forum for general discussion and  
debate but not for serious negotiations or decision. Increasingly  
evident also is the desire of major industrialised countries to  
reach agreements on far-reaching issues only among themselves  
without invoking the multilateral system. Because of their  
serious economic problems, many developing countries have come  
under pressure from developed countries. 
 
 <br><br>  Partly in order to revitalize the dialogue on important  
international economic issues in the United Nations, India along  
with some other developing countries called for 
<br>-xi&gt; 
 
<br><br>a discussion on the inter-related issues of money, finance, debt,  
trade, resource flows and development, to examine international  
cooperation in these vital areas in a coherent and integrated  
manner. This became the theme for special focus during the  
meetings of the Economic and Social Council. The discussion on  
this broad range of areas was continued during the exercise on  
the review and appraisal of the International Development  
Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. India  
worked closely with the Chairman of the Group of 77 and the  
Chairman of the Committee to reach an agreed consensus conclusion  
of this important exercise. Such a positive outcome had seemed  
doubtful during the two years of protracted negotiations on this  
issue and India was encouraged at this development. Intensive  
efforts also got underway within the Group of 77 to implement the  
Caracas Programme of Action. One of the few important initiatives  
in which progress has been made, is the establishment of a global  
system of trade preferences for which negotiations have begun. 
 
  <br><br> Both independently and as Chairman of the Non-aligned  
Movement, India repeatedly drew attention to the persistence of  
economic distress among large sections of mankind, the widening  
gap between the developed and developing countries and the close  
link between disarmament and development. In pursuance of  
decisions taken at the 7th Non-aligned Summit the Movement  
focused its efforts towards promotion of Nuclear Disarmament and  
International Economic Cooperation. The Prime Minister, as  
Chairman of the Movement, addressed a Special Plenary Meeting of  
Non-aligned countries at the UN Headquarters on 22nd October. The  
Movement remained actively seized of developments in various  
parts of the world, particularly Southern Africa, the Middle  
East, Central America and Cyprus and the Non-aligned caucus in  
the Security Council consisting of Non-aligned members of the  
Council in 1985 including India, played an important role in the  
deliberations of the Council on these and other issued. It also  
took a number of follow-up measures in implementation of the  
Action Programme for Economic Cooperation adopted by the 7th  
Summit. Following a Regional Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau  
held in March 1985 to consider the situation in South Africa, an  
Extra-ordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Bureau was held in New  
Delhi on the question of Namibia from 19 to 21 April. Besides,  
adopting an important Declaration and Programme of Action on  
Namibia, the meeting also adopted the plan of action of the  
Movement to improve the critical economic situation in Africa. 
 
 <br><br>  A large number of people of Indian origin have settled in many  
countries all over the world where they have made significant and  
wide-ranging contributions to the development of the countries of  
their adoption. It is the policy of the Government of India that  
persons of Indian origin who have taken the nationality of the  
countries of their domicile should identify themselves with the  
countries of their adoption. It is being increasingly appreciated  
that Indians overseas can provide a bridge of understanding in  
the efforts to strengthen friendly relations between India and  
the countries of their residence. They have demonstrated their  
potential as a reservoir of skill, expertise, technology and 
<br>-xii&gt; 
 
<br><br>investment for the benefit both of the countries of their  
adoption and the land of their origin. Steps have been taken to  
provide them with more efficient consular and information  
services. 
 
  <br><br> While a vibrant and resurgent India is taking shape, it is  
important to convey a proper appreciation of these developments  
to the world at large. The External Publicity Division of the  
Ministry has sought to achieve this through increasing use of  
more modern methods in both audio-visual and print media. The  
advent of the new Government through the ballot box and the  
defusing of crisis by the Prime Minister through accordsin Punjab  
and Assam and by successfully holding free and democratic  
elections in these two States, were widely covered by the media  
abroad. The fact that a very large foreign press corps is present  
in India, uninterruptedly reporting events, itself speaks for the  
strength of our democratic system and is appreciated all over the  
world. 
 
  <br><br> India's tenure as Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement is  
drawing to a close. During this period of three years, it is a  
matter of satisfaction that the Movement has gathered strength  
and has been able to secure better and wider attention from the  
public and the governments of countries outside it. There is now  
also greater appreciation of the principled positions taken by  
India on the major issues facing mankind. Neighbouring countries,  
in particular, have been assured that they can look to India as a  
dependable partner in their development and progress and for  
promoting stability and cooperation in South Asia.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>The tone of Indian policy towards neighbours was set by the  
Prime Minister in his very first broadcast to the nation on 5  
January 1985 after assuming office on New Year's Day. To give  
practical shape to the Prime Minister's desire for friendlier  
relations with the neighbouring countries the Foreign Secretary  
visited various capitals of the neighbouring countries. His visit  
to Dhaka in April 1985 was a precursor to higher level contacts  
between India and Bangladesh. 
 
  <br><br> When a cyclone ravaged the coast of Bangladesh in May 1985 the  
Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi accompanied by President  
Jayewardene of Sri Lanka who was then visiting New Delhi flew to  
Dhaka on 2 June 1985 to convey distress at the calamity that  
befell Bangladesh. Moved by the plight of the people of  
Bangladesh he promised India's help in rehabilitation of the  
people of Bangladesh. In accordance with this assurance the  
Government of India undertook the design and construction of  
about a hundred cyclone-proof shelters at Urir Char at a cost of  
Rs. 1.5 crores. 
 <br><br>
   In October 1985, the Prime Minister met President Ershad in  
Nassau, the Bahamas during the Commonwealth Heads of Government  
meeting. On this occasion an agreement was reached at the highest  
level that the Irrigation Ministers of the two countries should  
meet so that an approach to the solution of the long-standing  
problem of shortages in the Ganga could be discussed. In  
pursuance of this understanding, the Minister for Water  
Resources, Shri B. Shankaranand met the Bangladesh Irrigation  
Minister in New Delhi in November 1985. At the end of their  
discussions, the two countries signed a Memorandum of  
Understanding valid for three years, effective from January 1985,  
under which they undertook to initiate a joint study of the  
available river water resources common to both countries to  
enable them to find a solution to the problem of augmenting the  
waters of the Ganga at Farakka. Under the same Memorandum, a  
sharing arrangement of the Ganga waters at Farakka for a period  
of three years was also agreed upon on the same terms as the  
previous Memorandum of Understanding signed in 1982. This was a  
major breakthrough of an impasse which had persisted since the  
last Memorandum of Understanding expired in May 1984. 
 
  <br><br> The Prime Minister met President Ershad again in December 1985  
when he visited Dhaka for two days to attend the SAARC summit. On  
this occasion too, India's desire to improve the quality of  
bilateral relations between the two countries was conveyed to  
Bangladesh. The Government of India have been keen to expedite  
the implementation of our agreement with Bangladesh to lease the  
Tin Bigha corridor. 
<br>-2&gt; 
 
<br><br>Legal difficulties have, however, prevented this. Again, as a  
token of good faith, pending a permanent settlement, the  
Government of India have offered greater access to Bangladesh to  
its Dahagram and Angorpota enclaves. 
 
<br><br>  Some problems, however, persist. Among them is the continuing  
flow of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh into India. This has  
been discussed between the two governments on a number of  
occasions, including at a meeting between the Directors General  
of the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles. We have  
conveyed to Bangladesh our intention to stem this flow by  
whatever means possible. 
 
 <br><br>  About 70 students from Bangladesh avail of scholarships for  
studies in India in arts/sciences as well as medicine and  
engineering. Training facilities have been extended to Bangladesh  
Railway personnel under ITEC. Bangladesh defence personnel are  
also undergoing courses at various military training  
establishments in India. 
 
  <br><br> Trade with Bangladesh is governed by the 1973 Indo-Bangladesh  
Trade Agreement and attempts were made to increase the volume of  
bilateral exchanges. A 7-member delegation from Bangladesh  
participated in the Sixth India Engineering Trade Fair in  
February 1985. A delegation from the Engineering Export Promotion  
Council of Bangladesh also visited India and the Association of  
Indian Engineering Industries sponsored a visit of Indian  
industries to Bangladesh. 
 
  <br><br> An Indian Book Fair was held at Dhaka and at Rajshahi and a  
Bangladesh Book Fair was organised at New Delhi and Calcutta. 
 
  <br><br> The unresolved ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka continues to be a  
source of great concern to the Government of India. The  
escalation of violence and large scale killings of Tamil  
civilians caused great concern throughout India. The  
deteriorating situation in the Northern and Eastern provinces in  
Sri Lanka had direct repercussions on India, most notably through  
the massive influx of refugees to our shores. The total number of  
refugees from Sri Lanka in India now stands at over 124,000.  
Their presence poses socio-economic burdens and has added to the  
strength of Indian sentiments in regard to the situation in Sri  
Lanka. Aggressive action by Sri Lanka Naval Forces in the Palk  
Straits. including attacks on our fishing vessels resulting in  
the death of some fishermen, led to increased tension in our  
bilateral relations. Strong protests had to be lodged with the  
Sri Lanka Government in regard to these actions. A Sri Lanka  
naval vessel was apprehended on 11 January 1985 when it was found  
well within Indian waters, after it had attacked our fishermen.  
The vessel, along with its crew, was later handed over to the Sri  
Lanka authorities. Some Indian fishermen who had been under  
detention since October 1984, were released by Sri Lanka. 
 
  <br><br> India, however intensified its role of providing good offices  
to the two sides to arrive at a political solution. Negotiations  
between the Sri Lanka Government and 
<br>-3&gt; 
 
<br><br>the Sri Lanka Tamil groups were arranged with India's assistance,  
and while these have not yet brought about a solution, efforts at  
bringing the two sides closer through a process of direct and  
indirect negotiations are continuing. 
 
 <br><br>  Contacts have been maintained with the Sri Lanka Government at  
the highest level as part of the ongoing search for a political  
solution to the ethnic crisis. The Sri Lanka Minister for  
National Security paid a short visit to India in February 1985  
and held talks with the Prime Minister and other leaders. The  
Foreign Secretary visited Sri Lanka in March 1985 in pursuance of  
the Prime Minister's initiative to improve relations with  
neighbouring countries. During his meeting with President  
Jayewardene and other leaders, the basis for a renewed dialogue  
for resolving the Tamil problem was discussed further. The  
Foreign Secretary visited Sri Lanka again in the last week of May  
to prepare the ground for a two-day visit to India by President  
Jayewardene. President Jayewardene had detailed discussions with  
the Prime Minister during his stay in New Delhi from 1--3 June  
1985. 
 
  <br><br> The meetings between the Prime Minister and the Sri Lanka  
President led to a fresh initiative to find a solution to the  
crisis. It was agreed that immediate steps should be taken to  
defuse the situation and create a proper climate for a political  
settlement. The Government of Sri Lanka announced cessation of  
hostilities for three months from 18 June 1985. The climate was  
thus created for talks which were held in Thimpu, with the  
assistance of the Royal Government of Bhutan, in July and August  
1985. The Thimpu talks broke down in mid-August because of  
renewed violence, and the continuing gap between what the Sri  
Lanka Government was prepared to offer by way of a political  
solution, and the minimum demand of the Tamils. However,  
negotiations were continued indirectly through Indian efforts. It  
will be necessary for a climate to be created conducive to the  
success of these efforts. 
 
 <br><br>  Dr. H. W. Jayewardene, who led the Sri Lankan delegation to  
the Thimpu talks, was invited to stop over in Delhi, along with  
other Sri Lanka officials, at the end of August 1985. Following  
discussions with the Foreign Secretary, the Sri Lanka side  
prepared a fresh sct of proposals in a Working Paper, which, it  
was agreed, could serve as a basis for further negotiations.  
Representatives of the Tamil militant groups and the Tamil United  
Liberation Front later met in Delhi to discuss the Working Paper  
and matters relating to The maintenance of the ceasefire, beyond  
the 3-month period. The ceasefire was further extended, and a  
Monitoring Committee was set up by the Sri Lanka Government to  
monitor the working of the ceasefire. The proposals put forward  
by the Government of Sri Lanka were not, however, found  
acceptable to the Tamil groups. In response to the Prime  
Minister's suggestion, the TULF later put forward a set of  
proposals in December 1985. These proposals were conveyed to the  
Government of Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister met President  
Jayewardene at the CHOGM at Nassau in October 1985 and at the  
SAARC Summit in Dhaka in December 1985. At these meetings, the  
Prime Minister conveyed India's concern over the situation in Sri  
Lanka while reiterating India's continued willingness to assist  
in the quest for a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
<br>-4&gt; 
 
  <br><br> The Government of India have also expressed concern over  
reports that suggest that Sri Lanka is attempting a military  
solution to the crisis. The rapid increase in the Sri Lanka  
defence spending and reports of an escalation in the violence  
towards the end of the year have been viewed with disquiet. The  
Government of India are seriously concerned at the activities of  
foreign security and intelligence organisations in Sri Lanka.  
There are reports of Israeli intelligence organizations and  
British security experts being involved with the Sri Lanka  
security forces. The growing military nexus between Pakistan and  
Sri Lanka, following President Jayewardene's visit to Pakistan in  
April 1985 and the visit of the President of Pakistan to Sri  
Lanka in December 1985 is being viewed with some concern. 
 
<br><br>   While the ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka remained unresolved, an  
important positive development in the bilateral relationship  
between the two countries was the agreement in January 1986 to  
end once and for all the long-standing problem or statelessness  
of persons of Indian origin in Sri Lanka. The Government of India  
agrecd to grant citizenship and accept the repatriation of the  
balance of 94,000 remaining applicants for Indian citizenship  
together with their natural increase. The Sri Lanka Government  
for its part undertook to accord citizenship to the remaining  
stateless persons whose applications were pending together with  
their natural increase. It is hoped that this process will be  
completed expeditiously. 
 
 <br><br>  India's close association and cooperation-with Maldives is a  
continuing one. The Maldivian President, Mr. Gayoom, paid a short  
visit to New Delhi in February 1985. During his visit, he met the  
President and the Prime Minister. President Gayoom was assured of  
our full cooperation in the areas in which Maldives may need  
Indian assistance. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi paid a return  
visit to Male in February 1986 and assured Maldives of India's  
full cooperation in her development. 
 
 <br><br>  A regular twice-monthly shipping service from Tuticorin to  
Male was started in August 1985 and this service is expected to  
boost bilateral trade and supply of essential commodities like  
salt, vegetables etc. to Maldives. 
 
 <br><br>  India continued to offer training facilities to Maldivian.  
officials in different fields such as civil aviation, customs,  
hotel management, man-power survey, parliamentary procedures,  
etc. tinder the Indian Technical and Econornic Cooperation  
Programme. 
 
 <br><br>  Maldives has taken art active role in the SAARC. The South  
Asian Foreign Secretaries' meeting was held in Male in February  
1985. Under the aegis of SAARC, India has also provided the  
services of sports coaches for training Maldivian sportsmen. 
<br>-5&gt; 
<br> 
 <br>  India has traditionally close and friendly relations with  
Burma. To strengthen these relations the former Minister of State  
for External Affairs, Shri Khursheed Alam Khan paid an official  
visit to Burma in June 1985 on the invitation of the Burmese  
Foreign Minister. Various aspects of bilateral relations were  
discussed during the visit. Steps have been taken to increase  
India's trade with Burma. A cultural troupe and a team of defence  
officials also visited Burma during the year. A special photo  
exhibition Priyadarshini on the late Prim Minister was hold at  
the Indian Embassy in Rangoon in November 1985. Forty-six Burmese  
officials were offered training facilities in India during the  
year. 
 
<br><br>   The traditional closeness of Indo-Bhutan relations was  
highlighted during the year by two bilateral visits of His  
Majesty the King of Bhutan to India in February 1985 and Prime  
Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi to Bhutan in September 1985. Both  
meetings were marked by a close identity of views and  
understanding on matters of mutual interest, reflecting the  
relationship of trust and consultations that prevails between our  
two countries. The first Summit Conference of South Asian  
countries at Dhaka in December 1985 offorod further opportunity  
for the two leaders to carry forward the discussions held during  
the Prime Minister's visit. 
 
 <br><br>  In economic fields cooperation flourished. The largest Indo- 
Bhutan Project, the Rs. 240 crores 336 mw Chukha Hydel Project  
moved closer towards completion and made satisfactory progress.  
The first two turbines are expected to be rotated in the first  
half of 1986 when Bhutan will benefit from the power generated  
and surplus power will begin to flow into India. India will  
purchase all power surplus to Bhutan's requirements. The  
infrastructure to permit absorption of this power in India is  
nearly ready. 
 

</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align="justify"><br><br> Now projects were initiated this year, and announced by the  
Prime Minister during his visit to Bhutan. They include the  
improvement of the electricity distribution systems of Thimpu and  
Paro, the River Training Works in Southern Bhutan, the 50 kw  
Broadcasting Station in Thimpu and the Mini Hydel Projects in  
Eastern Bhutan. Discussions are in progress on the inclusion of  
the Nanglam Cement Plant, for which a loan by India to Bhutan is  
envisaged. 
 
  <br><br> Indian agencies were involved in several fields in Bhutan in  
various projects of differing sizes and locations-in  
telecommunications, where a Master Telecommunications Plan is  
being prepared for Bhutan, in road building, in geological  
exploration, archaeological restoration, irrigation works etc.  
These activities form important components in the development of  
Bhutanese infrastructure. A grant of Rs. 2 crores to Bhutan has  
enabled it to undertake Urban Development Works. 
 
  <br><br> In education, India continued to ofler opportunities for  
secondary as well as higher education and for specialised  
training in various fields such as defence, police, 
<br>-6&gt; 
 
<br><br>customs, medicine etc. India offered scholarships of upto Rs. 14  
lakhs as well as 20 Colombo Plan TCS slots for this purpose.  
Forty high-bred heifers have been presented to Bhutan for  
development of their animal husbandry programmes. India continued  
to supply at Bhutan's request certain essential commodities such  
as wheat, rice, sugar, coal, explosives, steel and edible oils at  
controlled prices. Indian Experts visited Bhutan to help it set  
up a super-market type structure to provide outlets for basic  
consumer goods at fair prices, and in the development of  
sericulture. 
 
 <br><br>  Bhutan's present Development Plan (Fifth) ends in 1987. India  
has off,-red finance of Rs. 134 crores (about 50 % of the Plan  
outlay) as aid. The process of drawing up Bhutan's next plan  
(1987-1992) has been initiated by Bhutan and a team from the  
Planning Commission and the Ministry of External Affairs held  
talks with their Bhutanese counterparts in August 1985 on the  
conceptual basis of the Sixth Plan. The Prime Minister affirmed  
during his visit to Bhutan that India will continue to offer  
assistance to Bhutan during the forthcoming plan. The quantum and  
nature of this assistance will be decided mutually during 1986. 
 
  <br><br> The state of friendship between India and Bhutan drew  
appreciation from His Majesty the King of Bhutan in a speech  
during the Prime Minister's visit when he stressed the existing  
harmony, trust and cooperation between Bhutan and India. 
 
 <br><br>  India and Nepal have continued to nurture their traditional  
and friendly relations. His Majesty the King of Nepal visited  
India in September 1985 and had wide-ranging discussions with the  
Prime Minister. The King voiced the feelings of both countries in  
saying on his return to Nepal that "We are happy to note that the  
growing understanding between Nepal and India which has found a  
further fillip...has given us cause for satisfaction." The Prime  
Minister met the King again in Dhaka in December 1985 during the  
, SAARC Summit, giving both the leaders an opportunity to rtview  
the development of relations since the King's visit to India.  
These free, frank and cordial exchanges of views between the two  
leaders paved the way for further expanding the interaction,  
goodwill and consultations on various bilateral matters. 
 
 <br><br>  Earlier, in April 1985, pursuant on the Prime Minister's  
initiative to improve overall relations with our neighbours, the  
Foreign Secretary visited Nepal. A widerange of bilateral matters  
were reviewed including the Joint Commission, the avoidance of  
double taxation and joint utilisation of water resources. Shri  
Shiv Shankar, MP also visited Nepal in July 1985 as the Prime  
Minister's Special Envoy, to discuss bilateral relations and  
cooperation in projects. 
 
   <br><br>A time-bound programme of four years was agreed in September  
1985 by the two Governments to conclude the work of  
reconstruction of missing and damaged boundary pillars on the  
demarcated Indo-Nepal border. 
<br>-7&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  India's role as a leading partner in the socio-economic  
development of Nepal manifested itself in a number of aid  
programmes. Two agreements-one for construction of a Museum  
Library-cum-Documentation Centre at the Institute of Forestry in  
Hetauda and the other for a Rural Electrincation Project to  
electrify 76 villages were signed with Nepal in August 1985.  
India's offer of Rs. 50 crores for the construction or 204- 
kilometre of the Western Sector of the East-West Highway was  
accepted by Nepal and an Agreement was signed in September 1985  
to this effect. 
 
  <br><br> Progress was achieved on the proposed Karnali Hydro-electric  
Project in Nepal. India and Nepal's joint sponsorship of an  
international consultane for preparation of the feasibility  
report was accepted by the World Bank. The project has a power  
potential of 3600 mw. Further discussions are continuing in the  
Committee of Secretaries on Water Resources on other mutually  
beneficial projects like the Pancheswar multipurpose project. 
 
   <br><br>The Out-patient Department of Bir Hospital, constructed with  
Indian aid was inaugurated by H. M. the King of Nepal in November  
1985. The Indian Minister of Health and Family Welfare was  
present on the occasion. With modern and sophisticated equipment  
provided in the Hospital, it has become a premier institution in  
the field of health-care in Nepal and is another testimony to the  
friendship and cooperation between the two countries. 
 
  <br><br> The 8th Inter-Governmental Committee meeting was held in Delhi  
in August 1985 to review the working of Treaties of Trade and of  
Transit and the Agreement for Cooperation to control unauthorised  
trade. While there was agreement that the Treaties between the  
two countries were functioning well it was felt that the terms of  
access to each other's markets should be constantly improved.  
Both Governments committed themselves to a positive approach in  
the promotion of Indo-Nepal joint ventures, which would add a new  
dimension to Indo-Nepal economic and commercial relations. The  
number of Nepalese products exempted from pro forma procedures  
was increased from 14 to 18 and the insurance charges for transit  
cargo reduced to 0.25%. The Transit Treaty was extended till  
March 1989. A feasibility study for the extension of the railway  
terminal from Raxaul to Birganj was prepared and handed over to  
Nepal. 
 
 <br><br>  The Government of India persevered in its efforts to normalise  
relations with Pakistan in keeping with our commitment to the  
letter and spirit of the Simla Agreement. A number of bilateral  
meetings at various levels were held. Of particular significance  
were, the inectings between our Prime Minister and Pakistan's  
President Zia-ul-Haq 
<br>-8&gt; 
 
<br><br>in New York (October 23), Muscat (November 19), Dhaka (December  
7) and New Delhi (December 17). In these meetings, the Prime  
Minister reiterated our concern about Pakistan's assistance to  
extremists and its nuclear weapons proaramm. India remains to be  
convinced on both these maticrs despite Pakistani claims to the  
contrary. Our concern regarding the acquisition of sophisticated  
weaponry by Pakistan was conveyed on different occasions. This in  
turn adds to the burden of our own defence expenditure and  
results in the diversion of resources needed for development. 
 
 <br><br>  At his meeting with the President of Pakistan in New Delhi on  
17 December 1985, the Prime Minister suggested a programme for  
improving relations which was concretised after discussions into  
a number of decisions. In view of Pakistani statements that India  
was planning to attack their nuclear facility at Kahuta, the Prim  
Minister suggested that India and Pakistan should not attack each  
other's nuclear facilities. This proposal was accepted and a  
formal agreement on it is being worked out. In pursuance of the  
decisions taken at the meeting, discussions were held in  
Islamabad from 8--10 January 1986 between the Finance Ministers  
of the two countries on ways for improving trade and economic  
relations, from 10--12 January 1986 between the Defence  
Secretaries of the two countries on the Siachen Glacier and from  
16--21 January 1986 between the Foreign Secretaries of India and  
Pakistan on a comprehensive treaty and other confidence building  
measures. However, the meeting of the Indo-Pakistan Joint  
Commission scheduled for March 1986 has not yet been held because  
Pakistan did not agree to the dates proposed by us for the  
meetings of Sub-Commissions I &amp; II which were to precede it.  
Since President Zia's visit, there have been unfoitunate  
statements and resolutions relating to Kashmir and minorities in  
India by responsible Ministers and other Pakistani leaders. The  
assurances given by Pakistan in respcct of its assistance to Sikh  
extremists have also not been fulfilled. 
 
  <br><br> An earlier meeting of the Indo-Pakistan Joint Commission held  
oil 2--4 July 1985 lel to the signing of an Agreement for  
Cooperation in Agricultural Research. Other decisions emanating  
from the Joint Commission meeting have resulted in the  
commencement of through railway booking facilities between the  
designated staticlis of the two countries from October 1985 and  
exchange of journalists. 
 
   <br><br>The year 1985 was an eventful one for South Asian Regional  
Cooperation since the first South Asian Summit was held in Dhaka  
on 7-9 December 1985 preceded by preparatory meetings of Foreign  
Ministers on 5 December 1985 and Standing Committee of Foreign  
Secretaries on 4 December 1985. The tasks before the Summit were  
to launch a fullfledged organisation called the South Asian  
Association for Regional Cooperation and to adopt a Charter for  
the Association and Declaration. Earlier in 
<br>-9&gt; 
 
<br><br>May 1985 the third meeting of the Foreign Ministers was held in  
Thimpu which drew up the draft Charter. The Standing Committee  
meeting was also held in Male in February 1985. The third round  
of the Technical Committee meeting which was held prior to the  
Summit devoted itself to the drawing up of more regional projects  
in their respective fields. 
 
 <br><br>  India has played an active role in the promotion of South  
Asian Regional Cooperation at all levels. Regional Cooperation  
was made the theme of the India international Trade Fair held in  
New Delhi from 14--27 November 1985. Tbe Trade Fair Authority of  
India organised the participation of SARC membercountries in the  
Fair and their national pavilions, as well as a successful SARC  
cultural festival organised to coincide with the Fair, drew large  
crowds. 
 
 <br><br>  During the Summit the Heads of State or Government of South  
Asian countries adopted a Charter and a Declaration. The Charter  
provides for an annual meeting of Heads of State and Government.  
The Council of Ministers is the highest policy making body of the  
Organisation which will meet twice annually. it has been decided  
to set up a permanent Secretariat for the Organisation. The  
Foreign Ministers will go into the details of its location,  
structure, financing and functions. The other decisions include  
tho convening of a Ministerial meeting to discuss women's  
participation in SAARC activities in India in 1986, another  
Ministerial meeting in Pakistan to coordinate the decisions of  
the South Asian countries on the ongoing discussions on New  
International Economic Order, the second Summit to be held in  
India in November 1986, etc. 
 
  <br><br> The Summit has been hailed as an historic event. The fact that  
the Summit took place and that the Heads of State or Government  
have decided to meet annually is itself very significant. A  
mechanism is now available for regular consultations among the  
Heads of State or Government of the South Asian countries.  
Moreover, with the creation of the Association, the adoption of  
its Charter and the categorical decision to establish the  
Secretariat of SAARC, regional cooperation in South Asia has been  
put on a firmer institutional footing. Cooperation that has taken  
place so far has contributed significantly to the creation of the  
infrastructure and engendering of habits for future cooperation. 
 
  <br><br> India's bilateral relations with Afghanistan progressed  
satisfactorily during the year. The Seventh Session of the Indo- 
Afghan Joint Commission on economic, trade and technical  
cooperation was held in New Delhi at the Ministerial level in  
August 1985. India would continue to provide assistance to  
Afghanistan in several areas including public health, industrial  
development and education. 
<br>-10&gt; 
 
  <br><br> India exchanged views on Afghanistan with different countries.  
India centinues to be opposed to both intervention and  
interference in Afghanistan and is of the firm View that there  
can be no military solution of the Afghan problem. India stands  
for a political settlement inAfghanistan that takes into account  
the legitimate interests of countries concerned. ln this context,  
India supports the initiative of the UN Secretary General.  
Unfortunately, the progress has not been according to  
expectations. India hopes that speedier progress will be made in  
the forthcoming rounds of Proximity Talks. 
 
  <br><br> The increasing Great Power military presence in the Indian  
Ocean and the consequent heightened tension in the area has been  
a matter of great concern to India. This militarisation has been  
the result of a number of factors stemming basically from the  
quest of the Great Powers to enlarge their spheres of influence.  
The presence, however, of extraneous powers adversely affects the  
security of the region by introducing extra-regional tensions as  
well as intensifying those that already exist. 
 
  <br><br> As earlier, India has remained committed to the complete  
removal of foreign military presence from the Indian Ocean and  
this view has been expressed in our bilateral consultations with  
foreign countries, as also through the forum of the Nonaligned  
Movement and international organisations. There have been  
disturbing reports that the Anglo-American base at Diego Garcia  
is to be upgraded and its facilities diversified. India hopes  
that littoral and hinterland countries would not align themselves  
with the Great Powers or offer them facilities of a military  
nature.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>Exchange of high level visits contributed towards  
strengthening the friendly relations with countries of South-East  
Asia and the Pacific region. Apart from bilateral and  
international matters, regional issues were discussed during  
these visits, including the Kampuchean issue which entered its  
eighth year. Although no solution has been found, there have been  
some positive developments. Both the ASEAN nations and the Indo- 
China countries have put forward proposals for the holding of  
talks. While there are differences on the modalities for  
conducting these talks, there now is the underlying common desire  
to reach a settlement. Vietnamese leaders assured our Prime  
Minister, during his visit to Hanoi on 27 November 1985, that the  
Indo-China countries were prepared to open talks with ASEAN  
nations to promote a political solution. They re-affirmed the  
commitment to withdraw Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea by 1990  
or even earlier, in the event of an acceptable solution being  
found. 
 
 <br><br>  During the year, India had the opportunity to exchange views  
with several ASEAN leaders and delegations. We have continued to  
emphasise the need for a comprehensive political settlement,  
which would lead to a durable peace in the region. We are  
maintaining contacts with the concerned parties and continuing to  
make such contribution as we can for arriving at a peaceful  
solution. 
 
  <br><br> On the bilateral front, we have continued to promote our  
relations with the three Indo-China states. We are happy that our  
technical assistance and training programmes have been found  
useful by them for the development of their human and material  
resources. We also helped them at their times of need by rushing  
relief supplies of medicines when they were afflicted by natural  
calamities. 
 
   <br><br>The visit of the Prime Minister to Hanoi on 27 November 1985,  
following as it did, the visit to India of the General Secretary  
of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr. Le Duan, in September  
1984, contributed significantly to the further consolidation and  
diversification of relations. The Prime Minister accepted the  
Gold StarOrder--the highest Vietnamese decoration, conferred  
posthumously on Shrimati 
<br>-12&gt; 
 
<br><br>Indira Gandhi in recognition of her contribution as an  
"indefatigable fighter for the cause of National Independence,  
Peace, Solidarity and Cooperation amongst Nations, as well as the  
growth of the Non-aligned Movement". The India-Vietnam Joint  
Commission, which met in Hanoi just prior to the Prime Minister's  
visit took some important decisions, which included an agreement,  
in principle, for extending a new line of government to  
government credit to Vietnam of Rs.15 crores and a Commodity loan  
of one lakh tonnes of wheat. 
 
  <br><br> Relations with Loas were further promoted when the Minister of  
State in the Ministry of External Affairs, Shri K. R. Narayanan,  
visited Vientiane to participate in the 10th anniversary  
celebrations (2 December 1985) of the founding of the Lao  
People's Democratic Republic. India was the only country outside  
the socialist bloc to be invited to the ceremony. In his keynote  
address, Mr. Kaysone Phomvihane, General Secretary of the Lao  
Revolutionary Party, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers,  
expressed appreciation of India's all-round cooperation with Laos  
and for her active Chairmanship of the Non-aligned Movement. 
 
   <br><br>India's relations with countries of ASEAN and Pacific region  
continued to be warm and friendly. There were exchanges of high  
level visits which enabled India and the countries of this region  
to have a better understanding of each other's perceptions  
contributing to further consolidation of bilateral relations. 
 
 <br><br>  Relations between India and the countries of ASEAN have been  
historically close but underwent some strain after the  
recognition by India of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. There  
were hardly any high level contacts between India and ASEAN over  
the previous five years but, of late, a definite trend has  
emerged which indicates that the ASEAN nations are interested in  
bringing bilateral relations back to the old level with the re- 
establishment of political dialogue. 
 
   <br><br>There has been an increasing awareness among the ASEAN  
countries that Kampuchea should not come in the way of  
improvement of bilateral relations. The various visits between  
India and the countries of ASEAN region was used as an  
opportunity to try to better understand each other's views on the  
Kampuchean issue. It was in this context that an ASEAN delegation  
consisting of three members from Malaysia, Singapore and  
Brunei,led by Ambassador Talala of Malaysia, visited India in  
August 1985, to explain ASEAN views on the Kampuchean issue. This  
was the first visit to India of a delegation representing ASEAN  
as a group, and represented understanding by them of India's  
principled position on this question. 
<br>-13&gt; 
 
   <br><br>President Soeharto of Indonesia made a stopover in India on 16  
November 1985. This gave an opportunity for talks to be held  
between the visiting President and Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv  
Gandhi. Bilateral relations, international issues of importance  
and regional matters were discussed during the visit. The  
discussions were held in a warm and cordial atmosphere. As a  
result, the existing traditional ties between India and Indonesia  
would be further strengthened. The Indonesian Foreign Minister  
Prof. Mochtar Kusumaatmadja came to India in April 1985 to attend  
the Non-aligned Coordinating Bureau Meeting. Earlier in January  
1985, Prof. Kusumaatmadja was in New Delhi for discussions on the  
Bandung Conference and delivered a message from President  
Soeharto to the Prime Minister.

after several years. The Thai Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Bhitchai  
Rattakul visited New Delhi in January 1985. He was received by  
the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi. 
 
   <br><br>In October/November 1985, the Foreign Minister of Malaysia,  
Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen paid a visit to India. Talks were held  
between the Malaysian Foreign Minister and the External Affairs

mutual understanding and of respect for each other's views. 
 
   <br><br>Shri A. P. Venkateshwaran, Secretary (East) in the Ministry of  
External Affairs visited Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in  
August 1985, as a Special Envoy of the Prime Minister to discuss  
issues pertaining to the venue of the next Non-aligned Summit

<br>-14&gt; 
 
<br><br>Soeharto in Indonesia and by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr.  
Mahathir Mohammed in Malaysia. In Singapore, he was received by  
the Senior Minister (Prime Minister's office) Mr. S. Rajaratnam.  
The Foreign Ministers of the three countries also received him.  
During discussions with Foreign Ministry officials, bilateral and  
regional topics were extensively covered allowing for a greater  
appreciation of each other's point of view and leading to an  
understanding that Kampuchea should not come in the way of  
improvement of bilateral relations. Secretary (East) had earlier  
paid an official visit to Malaysia and the Philippines in April  
1985 after attending the Bandung 30th Anniversary celeberations.  
While Secretary (East) was in Manila, bilateral consultation were  
held between the Foreign Office officials of the two countries. 
 
  <br><br> Following the recent general elections in the Philippines, the  
assumption of the office of the President by Mrs. Corazon Aquino  
confirmed the triumph of democracy, non-violence and the  
supermacy of the popular will in that country. The President and  
the Prime Minister sent their greetings to the new President. 
 
  <br><br> After assumption of power by the Labour Government of Prime  
Minister David Lange in 1984, there has been a perceptible change  
in New Zealand's relations with India. Prime Minister David  
Lange,visited India in April 1985 and held talks with the Prime  
Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi. Official level bilateral talks were  
also resumed after a gap of eleven years. Shri A. P.

Taxation were held with New Zealand in March 1985. The secnd  
round of negotiations was held in February 1986. 
 
  <br><br> The President of Nauru, Mr. Hammer De Roburt visited India  
twice in January and November 1985. At the talks held during the  
latter visit, understanding was reached on the question of  
Nauru's investment in the Paradeep Phosphate Ltd. 
 
  <br><br> Opportunity for exchange of views on Indo-Australia bilateral  
relations and on international and regional matters came up  
auring the visit to India in May 1985 of the Australian Foreign  
Minister Mr. Bill Hayden. The talks were resumed once again when  
Secretary (East) visited Australia in December 1985. 
<br>-15&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  Secretary (East) visited Fiji in December 1985 and held talks  
with the Fijian Government officials. He was received by the  
Governor General, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister  
and the Foreign Minister of Fiji. In another significant  
development, Fiji announced the accreditation of a Non-Resident  
High Commissioner to India. The Permanent Secretary for Foreign  
Affairs of Fiji will be the first NonResident High Commissioner.  
Negotiations for an Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation  
were conducted with Fiji in December. Emergency aid of Rs. 5  
lakhs towards cyclone relief was provided to them. 
 
  <br><br> During the year, diplomatic relations were also established  
with Kiribati and the Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs of  
Kiribati will be its first Non-Resident High Commissioner to  
India. The High Commissioner of India in Suva is concurrently  
accredited to Kiribati. 
 
  <br><br> Trade has come to be an important and significant element in  
the promotion of closer relationship with the countries of ASEAN  
and the Pacific. It is in this context that the then Minister of  
State for Commerce Shri P. A. Sangma visited Malaysia and  
Singapore in September 1985. The Thai Commerce Minister visited  
India in February 1985. During the visit, a Memorandum of  
Understanding creating a Joint Trade Committee was signed. The  
Minister of Trade and Industry of Malaysia came to India in  
November 1985 and the Minister of Trade from Australia visited  
India in October 1985. Ways and means to promote bilateral trade  
on a more balanced basis with these countries were discussed  
during these visits. For the first time, an officially sponsored  
Trade Development Board delegation from Singapore visited India  
in April 1985. This visit from Singapore has led to further trade  
visits from that country. The Minister of Overseas Trade of New  
Zealand is also scheduled to visit India in March 1986.

Republic of China were continued during 1985. It is our policy  
that genuine normalisation of our relations with China can be  
achieved only when there is a just and satisfactory settlement of  
the boundary question. 
 
   <br><br>Substantive discussions on the India-China boundary question  
were initiated during the 6th round of Official-level Talks held  
between India and China in New Delhi from 4-11 November 1985.  
Adopting a sector by sector approach, both sides explained their  
respective positions on the Eastern Sector of the India-China  
boundary. It was agreed that further discussions on the boundary  
question will take place in Beijing in 1986 at a time mutually  
convenient. A programme of exchanges in the fields of culture and  
science and technology was finalised during the 6th round of  
Talks. Both delegations also exchanged views on the international  
situation. A settlement of the long outstanding question of  
Indian Embassy property in Beijing was reached. 
 
 <br><br>  The 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic  
relations between India and China was observed by both countries

latter called on the Prime Minister in New York during the 40th  
Anniversary celebrations of the United Nations in October 1985. 
 
  <br><br> A Trade Protocol for the year 1986 was signed between India  
and China in New Delhi on 23 November 1985. The Protocol  
envisages a total trade turnover of 10 to 16 crores U.S. dollars  
between the two countries during 1986, in commodities such as  
iron-ore, manganese, chrome and shellac, power equipment and

headed by Mr. Qian Liren, Head of the International Liaison  
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi paid an official visit to Japan  
from 28 November to 1 December 1985. The visit, following as it  
did, Prime Minister Nakasone's visit to India in May 1984, marked  
a new stage in the consolidation of our friendly and cordial  
relations with Japan and an important phase in regard to further  
development of bilateral relations. The conclusion of an  
Agreement between India and Japan on cooperation in the field of  
Science and Technology was one of the important high-lights of  
the visit. The Agreement provides for the setting up of a Joint  
Committee on Science and Technology to draw up an agreed  
programme of action. New opportunities have thus been opened for  
India and Japan to work together as partners for progress, not  
only for their mutual benefit, but also for peace and prosperity  
in Asia and in the world. 
 <br><br>
   In his address to the Japanese Diet, the first ever by an  
Indian Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi emphasised the need to  
enhance cooperation between India and Japan in the economic,  
commercial, scientific and technological fields, as well as in  
increasing exchanges in the cultural and educational areas to  
promote better understanding between the peoples of the two  
countries. In this regard, it was agreed to organise a Festival  
of India in Japan in 1987-88 and a Japan Week in India. An Indo- 
Japan seminar was held in New Delhi in March 1986 to promote  
interaction in the field of ideas and to strengthen  
understanding. 
 <br><br>
   As a special gesture, Japan announced an additional soft loan  
facility of Yen 30 billion (about Rs. 160 crores) for a gas-based  
power generation project in Assam. This will be in addition to  
the Yen 39.23 billion (Rs. 195 crores) annual pledge made by  
Japan in June 1985. Japan also agreed to assist India in setting  
up the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Lucknow. The Japanese  
Government further expressed its willingness, in principle, to  
assist India in the modernisation of vital sectors such as steel,  
textiles and railways. 
 
   <br><br>Other high-level visits were exchanged between the two  
countries at various levels. A high-powered Indian Economic  
Mission led by Shri L. K. Jha, Adviser to the Prime Minister on  
Administrative Reforms visited Japan from 11-18 September 1985.  
This was a follow-up to the visit earlier made by a Japanese  
Economic Mission led by Mr. Goro Koyama in Nov./Dec. 1984. Other  
important visits were those of the Minister of State for Science  
and Technology, Shri Shivraj Patil (June 1985), Dr. Najma  
Heptullah, former Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha and Shri V. C.  
Shukla, IOC President. The Comptroller and Auditor General of  
India, Shri T. N. Chaturvedi, participated in an International

 <br><br>
   A number of Indian delegations, official and non-official, in  
the economic, commercial and other fields from the Chambers of  
Commerce, Export Promotion Councils, public sector undertakings  
etc. also visited Japan to study, discuss and explore  
possibilities for further expansion of economic and commercial  
cooperation. Minerals and 
<br>-18&gt; 
 <br><br>
Metals Trading Corporation and Japan Steel Mills signed an  
Agreement in February 1985 for increasing Indian iron-ore exports  
from 80 lakh tons to 100 lakh tons a year. India participated in  
the World Import Fair in Nagoya and the annual Restaurant and  
Food Exhibition in Tokyo.

parliamentarians, officials and businessmen visited India to  
discuss bilateral cooperation and collaboration. The City of  
Yokohama marked the 20th anniversary of its sister-city  
relationship with Bombay by observing a Bombay Week from 29 April  
to 6 May 1985. 
 
  <br><br> Bilateral relations between India and the Republic of Korea  
were marked by increasing exchanges in economic and commercial  
fields. The former Chief Justice of India, Shri Y. V. Chandrachud  
visited the Republic of Korea from 12-17 May 1985, at the  
invitation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of ROK. Shri  
T. N. Chaturvedi, Comptroller and Auditor General visited Seoul.  
Shri A. P. Venkateswaran, Secretary in the Ministry of External  
Affairs led a delegation to Seoul for bilateral consultations in  
June 1985. Shri R. P. Khosla, Secretary, Steel, led a delegation  
to visit steel plants in South Korea in August 1985. A 14-member  
Indian official delegation headed by Shri V. P. Singh, Finance

delegation from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, All  
India Radio, and Doordarshan visited ROK from 19-31 October, to  
attend the 22nd General Assembly and Associated meetings of the  
Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union. 
 
  <br><br> During the visit in July 1985 of the ROK Foreign Minister Mr.  
Won Kyung Lee, India-ROK relations were discussed as also views  
exchanged on the major international issues and the situation in  
the Korean Peninsula. 
 
  <br><br> A 14-member Korean trade mission sponsored by the Korean Trade  
Promotion Corporation explored the possibilities of promoting  
Korean exports to India and to establish joint ventures with  
India. 
 
  <br><br> The 5th round of India-ROK trade talks were held at Seoul in  
November 1985. The ROK agreed to the removal of certain tariff  
and non-tariff restrictions on the 
<br>-19&gt; 
 
<br><br>import of some items from India and also to send a buying mission  
to India to increase the import of Indian goods. During the  
talks, joint ventures including those in third countries were  
discussed. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the  
State Trading Corporation of India and Daewoo Corporation to  
develop trade volume on a planned basis. These exchanges  
culminated in the visit of the Prime Minister of the Republic of  
Korea to India in March 1986. 
 
 <br><br>  In April 1985, the Vice-Premier of the Democratic People's  
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Kim Yong Nam led a delegation on an  
official visit to India. He paid a courtesy call on the President  
and the Prime Minister and held bilateral talks with the Minister  
of State for External Affairs. A delegation led by the DPRK  
Minister for Foreign Trade participated in the International  
Conference on the Global System of Trade Preferences held in July  
1985 in New Delhi. A Workers' Party of Korea delegation, led by  
Mr. Kim Bongju, also visited India in August 1985. 
 
  <br><br> The DPRK-India trade talks were held in December 1985 to  
explore the possibility of diversifying and extending the two-way

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>India's traditional and deep rooted ties with the Arab States  
of West Asia and North Africa and with Iran were further  
intensified and strengthened during 1985. In this period, several  
high level exchanges took place, the most notable, of course,  
being the visits of the Prime Minister to Egypt and Algeria in  
June 1985 during which he had wide-ranging discussions with  
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Chadli Bendjedid  
of Algeria on matters of bilateral and international importance. 
 
  <br><br> During 1985, as in the past, India was active in its support  
of the Palestinian people. It was instrumental in the convening  
of a meeting of the Non-aligned Committee on Palestine in New  
Delhi in April 1985. The Committee recommended that the convening  
of an international peace conference under the aegis of the  
United Nations offered the best, if not the only path, to the  
attainment and exercise of the inahenable rights of the  
Palestinian people and to a comprehensive, just and durable peace  
in West Asia. India strongly condemned the Israeli bombing of the  
PLO Headquarters in Tunis in October 1985 and the Prime Minister  
Shri Rajiv Gandhi sent messages of solidarity and support to both  
the PLO Chairman and the Tunisian Prime Minister. India also  
supported resolutions condemning this attack in the UN Security  
Council and in the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  
Chairman Yasser Arafat visited India twice during the year-first  
in April 1985 to attend the Non-aligned Coordinating Bureau  
meeting and again in November 1985 to attend the Non-aligned  
Youth Conference. 
 
   <br><br>The situation in Lebanon continued to be a matter of concern  
to India. India stands for the withdrawal of all foreign forces  
from Lebanon, beginning with those of Israel and, in this  
context, it reiterated its support for the UN Security Council  
resolutions 508 &amp; 509. India hopes that the Lebanonese people  
will, in a spirit of national reconciliation, be able to bring  
about peace and security in Lebanon. India has always stood for a  
strong, united and non-aligned Lebanon. 
 
  <br><br> Indo-Algerian ties are poised to become a model of South-South  
cooperation. During 1985, there was a considerable increase in  
commercial exchanges between 
<br>-21&gt; 
<br><br> 
the two countries and many possibilities for mutual cooperation  
were identified which would enable India to secure several  
project contracts in Algeria in the near future. With a view to  
enhancing the range and scope of industrial, technical and  
commercial cooperation between the two countries, the Algerian  
Vice-Minister of Chemical and Petro-Chemical Industries, Mr. Hadj  
Haoussine, led a high powered delegation to India in April 1985. 
 
<br><br>   As in 1984, India continued its efforts to improve relations  
with Morocco. An Indian delegation led by the then Minister of  
State for Commerce, Shri P.A. Sangma, visited Rabat in May 1985  
for the Indo-Moroccan Joint Committee meeting which had been set  
up under the Indo-Moroccan Trade Agreement of 1981. Subsequently,  
during 1985 an Indo-Moroccan Cultural Agreement was signed. In  
March 1985 India received the Moroccan Speaker, Mr. Ahmed Osman  
and thereafter the Moroccan Minister for Culture, Mr. Mohammed  
Benaissa, as Special Envoys of the King. The Prime Minister also  
sent a Special Envoy to Morocco in September 1985 with a message  
for the King of Morocco in these circumstances, it was  
unfortunate that Morocco chose to break off diplomatic relations  
with India on 1 October 1985 following India's recognition of the  
Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). It may be mentioned that  
India's decision to recognise the SADR was taken only after  
extensive consultations with all parties concerned including  
Morocco. Moreover, this decision was in tune with India's policy  
of supporting freedom struggles and genuine liberation movements  
the world over, as also with its policy of being guided by the  
decisions taken by the competent regional organisation in this  
case the OAU-which admitted the SADR as an active member and of  
which the SADR was elected a Vice-President. 
 
 <br><br>  Shri Khursheed Alam Khan, former Minister of State for  
External Affairs, visited Libya in August 1985 for pre-Luanda  
consultations. During the visit there was also a mutually  
beneficial exchange of views on a wide-range of bilateral and  
international issues. In addition, a Cultural Agreement was also  
signed.

   The Tunisian Minister for Planning, Mr. Ismail Khelil visited  
India in March 1985 in order to identify new areas of economic  
and commercial cooperation between the two countries. This visit  
has successfully paved the ground for the next meeting of the  
Indo-Tunisian Joint Commission. 
 
  <br><br> The first meeting of the Indo-Egyptian Joint Commission was

identified several measures during the meeting for increasing  
industrial, commercial, economic and technical cooperation  
between the two countries. 
 
  <br><br> India also maintained close contacts with the countries in the  
Gulf region. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, made an  
official visit to Oman on 17 &amp; 18 November 1985 on the occasion  
of the 15th anniversary of the accession to the throne by Sultan  
Qaboos bin Said. The visit, soon after the sixth Summit of the  
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Muscat (Oman), lent further  
strength to India's close relations with the Gulf countries. 
 
  <br><br> The former Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri  
Khursheed Alam Khan, paid an official visit in May 1985 to the  
United Arab Emirates leading the Indian delegation to the Indo- 
UAE Joint Commission meeting. The visit further strengthened the  
growing bilateial relations between the two countries. 
 
  <br><br> The continuing Iran-Iraq war, which started in September 1980,  
was a constant subject of India's attention. Efforts were made  
both as a friendly country and as Chairman of NAM to find ways  
and means to bring about a peaceful end to the war through  
negotiations. When the conflict escalated with the resumption of  
attacks on civilian targets by both the countries, our Prime  
Minister sent urgent messages to the Presidents of Iran and Iraq  
on 13 March 1985 urging an end to the attacks on civilian  
population as a first step to be followed by other measures of  
de-escalation leading ultimately to cessation of hostilities. He  
followed this up with a public appeal on 15 March 1985 andt  
hereafter sent the Minister of State for External Affairs as his  
Special Emissary to the concerned capitals to achieve the  
objective of peace in the region. Unfortunately, the differences  
in the respective positions of Iran and Iraq remained too wide  
for any effort to succeed. However, India continued to maintain  
good and friendly relations with each side and bilateral  
cooperation progressed smoothly with both Iran and Iraq. 
 
  <br><br> Heavy fighting erupted in the Peoples Democratic Republic of  
Yemen on 13 January 1986 following internal rivalries. President,  
Ali Nasser Mohammed was deposed and replaced by Dr. Abu Baker Al- 
Attas. There were some 3000 Indian nationals in PDRY. Some 425 of  
them were able to reach Djibouti during the fighting and were  
evacuated from there to India. Eleven Indian nationals were  
killed accidentally during the fighting. The 
<br>-23&gt; 
 
<br><br>Indian Embassy personnel remained at their posts throughout. The  
Government of India sought and received assurances from the PDRY  
Government regarding safety and security of all Indian nationals  
who wished to continue to work there. 
 
  <br><br> India's relations with Saudi Arabia remained on a firm footing  
and cooperation in different spheres showed steady progress. 
 
 <br><br>  There are an estimated 9.6 lakhs Indian migrant workers in the  
Gulf region. A significant step was achieved when the Labour  
Minister of Qatar visited India in April 1985 and signed a Labour  
Agreement with India. This agreement is the first one signed with  
any country in the Gulf and provides for safeguarding the  
interests of Indian nationals within the parameters of Indian and  
local labour laws. This agreement could provide the basis for  
similar agreements with other countries. 
 
  <br><br> The economic recession in the Gulf countries due to the  
decline in the price of crude oil has resulted in a sharp  
reduction in new job opportunities in the Gulf. While there has  
been substantial increase in the number of Indian nationals in  
Oman and the Yemen Arab Republic, there has been decrease in  
Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. The Indian emigrants in the Gulf are  
by and large prosperous and happy. However, considering their  
large numbers, problems do arise from time to time. The Indian  
Missions continue to provide necessary consular help to them.

India's relations with African countries South of the Sahara  
continued to develop satisfactorily during the year. Both as  
Chairman of NAM and bilaterally, India played its role during  
1985, in assisting the many countries of Africa suffering from  
drought and famine, and in focusing attention on South Africa's  
continued illegal occupation of Namibia, as well as the  
deteriorating situation within that country. The Pretoria  
regime's repression of the majority black population of South  
Africa, and the people's resistance to apartheid and struggle for  
equal rights, dominated the deliberations of NAM, the UN, and the  
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Nassau. In all these  
meetings, India championed the cause of the oppressed people of  
South Africa. 
 
  <br><br> The gift of 100,000 tonnes of wheat to famine-affected African  
countries announced in 1984 was shipped in 1985; the recipients  
were Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. In addition,  
India announced a contribution of Rs. 12 crores to the OAU's  
Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in  
Africa, for the purchase of cereals from India. The outgoing  
Acting Secretary-General of the OAU, in his report to the meeting  
of the Council of Ministers preceding the 21st OAU Summit in July  
1985, expressed happiness at the Government of India leading the  
way in regard to the contributions for this Emergency Fund. At  
the Extra-ordinary Ministerial meeting of the Non-aligned  
Coordinating Bureau in New Delhi in April 1985, which gave its  
primary attention to Namibia's freedom struggle, the critical  
economic situation in Africa was also considered, and a Plan of  
Action was adopted to meet immediate requirements, as well as to  
evolve a medium and long-term strategy. India was chosen as the  
focal point to monitor this Plan, and to coordinate offers of  
assistance. Under this Plan, India will provide technical  
expertise for agricultural projects in seven sub-Saharan  
countries. Bilaterally, India continued to give material  
assistance to the liberation movements in southern Africa,  
contributed relief supplies, mostly in the form of medicines, to  
countries afflicted by natural calamities, besides providing  
scholarships and traineeships to nationals of a number of African  
countries. Experts in various fields, particularly in water  
management and education, were also deputed to African countries,  
as in the past. 
<br>-25&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  Notable under the head of bilateral assistance during 1985 is  
the new government credit of Rs. 5 crores and the EXIM Bank  
credit of another Rs. 5 crores committed to Mauritius. An  
additional grant of Rs. 50 lakhs to the Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital  
project, the gifting of 10,000 tonnes of wheat flour and 500  
tonnes of pulses, and the annual increase in the number of  
scholarships to 100, have also been made available to Mauritius.  
These were agreed upon during the visit of the Mauritian Prime  
Minister, Mr. Anerood Jugnauth, to New Delhi in April 1985.  
During the Third Session of the Indo-Mauritian Joint Commission  
in New Delhi in August 1985. India agreed to provide additional

different projects. 
 
  <br><br> During the NAM Ministerial Coordinating Bureau Meeting in New  
Delhi in April 1985, the Prime Minister announced India's  
decision to accord full diplomatic status to the SWAPO  
Representative in India. During that meeting as well as at the  
NAM Ministerial meeting at Luanda and at the UN, India forcefully  
reiterated its stand that the "Interim Administration" set up by  
the Pretoria regime in Namibia, with the connivance of the  
discredited and unrepresentative Multi-Party Conference was  
illegal, that the UN Security Council Resolution 435 was the only  
basis for a settlement of the issue, that SWAPO was the only  
legitimate representative of the Namibian people, and that  
extraneous issues, like the withdrawal of Cuban troops from  
Angola, should not be linked to the question of the independence  
of Namibia. Elimination of apartheid and the establishment of a  
non-racial representative government in South Africa, was a  
subject which dominated the Commonwealth Heads of Government  
Meeting at Nassau in October 1985. India was able to assist in  
achieving a consensus among the Commonwealth members for a  
Programme of Common Action against Pretoria. India has nominated  
Shri Swaran Singh as its representative on the seven-member Group  
of Eminent Persons set up during the Meeting, to promote  
political dialogue and to monitor the progress of the South  
African regime's responses.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>Although pre-occupied with immediate concerns, most of the  
countries of Western Europe, now restored and prosperous after  
World War II, are increasingly seeking once again an active  
role, albeit buttressed by the NATO umbrella. With economies that  
are highly export dependent, they continue to seek wider world  
openings for their trade. 
 
  <br><br> India with its growing economy, an avowed intention to adapt  
advanced technologies in several spheres, and a liberalised  
import policy has therefore been one of the target countries for  
West Europe on commercial interest during the year. The stability  
and direction provided by the new Indian leadership, particularly  
after the events of 1984, re-affirmed the confidence of these  
nations in India as a reliable partner in economic and industrial  
exchanges. This has led to several of these advanced countries  
coming forward to tap the Indian market with offers of capital  
goods, know-how and investment. While the growth of Indian  
exports to these countries has recorded some increase our balance  
of trade with them continues to be negative, and therefore, of  
concern to us. Visiting ministers from West Europe have almost  
invariably brought with them large delegations of industrialists  
and businessmen interested in joint collaborations with and  
investments in India. These contacts, as well as the  
strengthening of inter-governmental structures for commercial and  
economic cooperation by means of regular official meetings,  
should help improve,both the level and content of India's  
interaction with Western Europe. 
 
 <br><br>  Perhaps more than in any one year in the past decade, this  
year has witnessed the largest exchange of visits between India  
and Western Europe. Besides the visits of the Prime Ministers of  
Greece and Sweden in January 1985 for participation in the Six- 
Nation Summit on Nuclear Disarmament, a stop-over visit in April  
1985 by the British Prime Minister and a state visit by the Queen  
of Netherlands. India was happy to welcome the Pope,the Crown  
Prince of Norway, and once again the Prime Ministers of Sweden  
and Greece in the first two months of 1986. 
   The Government of India received with shock the news of the  
tragic assassination of Mr. Olaf Palme, the Prime Minister of  
Sweden in Stockholm on 28 February, 1986. The Government of India  
observed a day's State mourning in honour of the departed Swedish  
Leader. Rich tributes were paid to Mr. Palme, in both Houses of  
Parliament, which adjourned after observing a two-minute silence. 
 <br><br>  The Prime Minister made an official visit to France in June  
1985 during which, apart from the inauguration of the Festival of  
India in Paris, bilateral and international 
<br>-28&gt; 
 
<br><br>issues were discussed in depth. During the discussions with the  
British leaders in October 1985 when the Prime Minister visited  
London, we conveyed our serious concern to the UK about the  
continuing anti-Indian activities of Sikh extremists from their  
soil. The Prime Minister's visit in the same month to the  
Netherlands, although brief was significant in that it reaffirmed  
to both our countries the importance we attach to ongoing and  
closer Indo-Dutch cooperation in several fields. 
 
   <br><br>Other Ministerial visits in the ecnonomic, industrial,  
cultural and educational fields between India and Western Europe  
during this period have been many, quite apart from those of  
parliamentary delegations, industrial and business groups,  
academicians, journalists etc. With Western Europe now playing a  
key role in world economy, and being a viable source of high  
technology inputs for India, closer contacts with West Europe  
cannot but be to our advantage. 
 
 <br><br>  Anti-Indian extremist activity in Western Europe has been  
continuously monitored by us and we have been in close contact  
with the Governments of the countries concerned in order to  
control extremist elements there, and most governments, have been  
responsive to our concern in this matter. In,March     1985 the  
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany gave us their  
assurance that they would firmly control activitics directed  
against the unity and integrity of India, and that illegal  
activities of Sikh extremists would not be tolerated. While the  
UK Government has also taken some steps against anti-Indian  
extremists, pro-Khalistani Sikhs and JKLF supporters continue to  
be active there. We are pursuing our demarches with the UK  
Government in order to see that concrete steps are taken to put  
an end to such activities. 
 
  <br><br> India continued to maintain friendly and cordial relations  
with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of Eastern  
Europe. There was a fruitful growth in our economic and cultural  
exchanges with these countries. 
 
  <br><br> The Vice-President, Shri R.Venkataraman visited Bulgaria, the  
German Democratic Republic and Yogoslavia, in November 1985. The

March 1985 to pay respects to the memory of President Cherneko.  
During the visit he had talks with the newly elected General  
Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Mr. M.S.Gorbachev. The  
Prime Minister's visit in May 1985 was a leading event in Indo- 
Soviet relations. His meetings with General Secretary Mr.  
Gorbachev provided the occasion for an extensive review of  
bilateral relations and major international issues. The dialogue  
was continued during the Prime Minister's brief stop over in  
Moscow in October 1985.

provided guidelines for the development of bilateral economic  
cooperation, and also prepared for the Prime Minister's visit.  
Indo-Soviet trade maintained a good tempo of growth. A notable  
event was the signing of the Long Term Trade and Payments  
Agreement for 1986-90 which envisages an increase in the turnover  
by one and half to two times over the,  figure for the preceding  
five-year period. The agreement was signed in Moscow by the then  
Minister of Commerce, Shri Arjun Singh and the Soviet Minister of  
Foreign Trade, Mr. B. Aristov. A highlight of bilateral  
cooperation in science and technology was the exhibition of  
Indian Science and technology held in Moscow in September 1985  
when the Minister of State for Science &amp; Technology Shri Shivraj  
Patil visited the Soviet Union. There was fruitful inter-action  
in many other sectors of the economy. 
 
 <br><br>  Exchanges in culture, arts, education, sports and other fields  
also developed well. A leading event was the decision to hold a  
Festival of Indian culture in the USSR in mid-1987 to be followed

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>Indo-US relations have been marked by greater understanding  
and cooperation during 1985-86. A major development in bilateral  
relations was the visit of the Prime Minister to USA from 11-15  
June 1985. The Prime Minister had wide-ranging discussions with  
President Reagan and his cabinet colleagues. He addressed aJoint  
Session on the Congress, met prominent scientists,  
representatives of the media and industry, as-also the Indian  
Community. In Washington the Prime Minister also inaugurated the  
Festival of India which was dedicated to the memory of Shrimati

in 1984 amounted to Rs. 3061 crores (2551.4 million) while  
imports from USA were of the value of Rs. 1857 crores (1548.1  
million). A Memorandum of Lhiderstanding (MOU) on techno logy  
transfer signed in November 1984 and finallseed by nud-1 985  
opened now avenues for Indo-US cooperation. 
 
   <br><br>Developments in India continued to receive media attention.  
The Punjab accord and the holding of the elections in that State,  
the settlement in Assam followed by elections, and the new  
econoinic policy received favourable comment. 
 
   The detection of conspiracies against the person of the Prime  
Minister and the Chief Minister of Haryana, activities of  
extremist groups like the World Sikh Organisation and the  
training of extremists in a mercenary training school in USA were  
the cause of deep concern in India. India has welcomed the desire  
of the United States Government to cooperate with us in curbing  
the international dimensions of terrorist violence against India,  
and noted sonic positive steps taken in this regard. 
<br>-33&gt; 
 
  <br><br> India and the USA have some differences in their perception  
and approach to some international issucs. There are also some  
differences over regional issues. However, both sides have kept  
in touchion a variety of issues in order to narrow the  
differences and enhance mutual undcrstandine. At the saime time,  
both sides have been making Lin Vffort to build on the many  
common areas of interest to mutual benefit. 
 
  <br><br> In the second half of 1985, high level bilateral contacts

  <br><br> India has been deeply concerned about the activities of  
extremists in Canada, wbich included violence against Indian  
diplomats, a bate campaign against Indian lead ers,  
misrepresentation of developments in India through the community  
media, etc. The tragic dimension of the problem was highlighted  
when Air India Flight 182 crashed off the coast of Ireland in  
June 1985 apparently due to sabotage. 
 
   <br><br>The Canadian Government took some steps to counter extremist  
activities against India by Canada-based elements. These included  
the piovision of greater security to our diplomatic staff, the  
extension of Part-II of the Canadian Extradition Act to India  
effective from 31 October 1985 and the lifting of the 17-month  
moratorium on the deportation of Sikhs found to be in Canada in  
contravention of the Immigration Act. Both sides have also agreed

<tr><td><p align="justify"><br>The year 1985 marked the 40th anniversary of the establishment  
of the United Nations, an event which was enthusiastically  
commemorated at the United Nations and around the world including  
India. The special commemorative session of the UN General  
Assembly in observance of the 40th anniversary was held from 14  
to 24 October 1985. During the 40th General Assembly session, a  
total of 35 Heads of State, 33 Heads of Government and 43 Special  
Envoys addressed the Assembly, the vast majority of them during  
the special commemorative period. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  
visited New York in this connection from 22-24 October 1985.  
Among other Heads of State or Government present were the  
Presidents of USA, Yugoslavia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Prime  
Ministers of U.K., China, Canada, Sweden, Japan and Sri Lanka,  
Chancellors of FRG and Austria and Special Envoys from USSR and  
France. 
 
   <br><br>The presence of an unprecedently large number of leadersat the  
UN for the 40th anniversary observance was itself a testimony to  
the faith and confidence reposed in the UN by the international  
community. The statements by various leaders contained a clear  
and unanimous reaffirmation of the continuing importance and  
relevance of the UN as a unique forum for finding solutions to  
pressing international problems in varied fields. A majority of  
statements at the commemorative session focused on pressing  
global and regional problems like disarmament, apartheid,  
Namibia, Middle East, Palestine, Central America, the debt issue  
etc. 
 
  <br><br> The special commemorative session, however, failed to adopt a  
Declaration originally envisaged for the occasion. In spite of  
its best efforts, the Indian delegation, which chaired the  
informal drafting group to elaborate such a text, did not succeed  
in evolving a consensus. The commemorative session did however  
adopt a resolution by consensus, which declared 1986 as the  
International Year of Peace. 
 
<br><br>Security Council 
 
   <br>India completed its 2-year term of the Security Council as a  
non-permanent member on 31 December 1985. The importance of  
India's membership of the Council for its fifth term during 1984- 
85 was enhanced by its concurrent Chairmanship of the Movement of  
Non-aligned countries. India served as the President of the  
Council during 
<br>-38&gt; 
<br> <br>
February 1985. As many as 73 meetings were convened during 1985  
and 21 resolutions adopted. India participated constructively in  
the deliberations of the Security Council on the various issues  
of which the Council was seized. 
<br><br> 
   A Special Commemorative Meeting of the Security Council held  
on 26 September 1985 unanimously adopted a Declaration in which  
an urgent need to enhance the effectiveness of the Security  
Council in discharging its principal role of maintaining  
international peace and security was emphasised. The Indian  
statement at this meeting reiterated the undiminished faith of  
the Government and people of India in the UN and continued  
commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the  
Charter. 
 
 <br><br>  A significant development was the strong condemnation by the  
Security Council of all acts of hostage taking and abduction, and  
a call for the immediate safe release of all hostages and  
abducted persons wherever and by whomsoever they were being held.  
The Security Council took this action by unanimously adopting  
Resolution 579 on 18 December 1985 which was sponsored by  
Australia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, UK  
and the USA. India voted in favour of the Resolution. In the wake  
of the Achille Lauro incident, the Council also adopted a  
Presidential Declaration condemning "terrorism" wherever and by  
whomsoever committed. In another Declaration, the Council,  
condemning the terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports,  
called upon all concerned to exercise restraint and to refrain  
from taking any action inconsistent with their obligations under  
the UN Charter and international law. 
 
<br><br>Political Issues 
 
 <br>  India was active in all the three main fora dealing with  
disarmament issues, namely the Conference on Disarmament, the UN  
Disarmament Commission, and the First Committee of the UN General  
Assembly. India firmly believes that in this nuclear age,  
disarmament is indispensable not only for world peace but for the  
very survival of mankind. 
 
  <br><br> As a follow-up of the Joint Appeal of 22 May 1984, India took  
the initiative to call for an urgent dialogue between the Nuclear  
Weapon States. The Heads of State/ Government of Argentina,  
Greece, Mexico, India, Sweden and Tanzania met in New Delhi on 28  
January 1985 and adopted the Delhi Declaration which, inter alia,  
reaffirmed the appeal of 1984 urging the Nuclear Weapon States to  
halt testing, production and deployment of nuclear weapons to be  
followed by programme of arms reduction, leading to general and  
complete disarmament. The Delhi Declaration further called for  
urgent steps to prevent the arms race in Outer Space and for  
concluding a comprehensive treaty prohibiting the testing of  
nuclear weapons. On 24 October, the six leaders addressed a joint  
message to President Reagan of U.S. and General Secretary  
Gorbachev of USSR, putting forward some ideas for consideration  
at the Geneva Summit in November 1985. They proposed the  
suspension of all nuclear tests for a period of 12 
<br>-39&gt; 
 
<br>months, such a suspension to be extended or made permanent, and  
offering their good offices to facilitate the establishment of  
effective verification arrangements. 
 
 <br><br>  As in previous years, India took several initiatives in the  
First Committee to promote nuclear disarmament. A record number  
of resolutions were adopted this year in the UN First Committee,  
focusing on urgently desired action for prevention of nuclear war  
and to bring about nuclear disarmament. Sixty seven resolutions  
were adopted on disarmament items of which India co-sponsored 12  
and voted in favour of 51. India's own traditional proposals on a  
freeze on nuclear weapons and on a Convention on the prohibition  
of use of nuclear weapons retained their relevance and were  
adopted with the support of an overwhelming majority. Along with  
a large number of Non-aligned as well as Western and Socialist  
States, India co-sponsored a resolution in which the General  
Assembly decided to convene an International Conference on  
Disarmament and Development in Paris in July 1986. The unanimous  
adoption of this Resolution symbolised a modest achievement for  
the international community. India was elected as Chairman of the  
Preparatory Committee for the International Conference on  
Disarmament and Development. 
 
  <br><br> There was a remarkable upsurge in the worldwide concern on the  
subject of prevention of an arms race in outer space. As in the  
preceding years, the UN General Assembly again adopted a single  
resolution on this subject with the support of all delegations  
except one. 
 
  <br><br> As regards those proposals which raised peripheral concerns  
and sought to divert attention from the highest priority issues  
of nuclear disarmament and prevention of nuclear war, India took  
a forthright stand and, in a number of cases, abstained from  
voting in favour of some resolutions. India, as in the past,  
voted against the Pakistani resolution on a Nuclear Weapon Free  
Zone in South Asia, categorically rejecting the proposal as  
unrealistic and unnecessary annual ritual, which was not related  
to the primary task of confidence building among the nations of  
South Asia. 
 
  <br><br> Apart from disarmament items, other political issues of  
continuing concern were South Africa, Namibia, Palestine, Central  
America, Cyprus and issues relating to Decolonisation. Of the new  
items on the agenda, the important ones related to international  
cooperation in the peaceful exploitation of outer space under  
conditions of its non-militarization. A notable achievement of  
the 40th General Assembly was the adoption without vote of a  
resolution on 'Measures to Prevent International Terrorism'. The  
General Assembly also decided to set up a group of high-level  
experts to study ways to improve the functioning of the United  
Nations. 
 
<br><br>West Asia 
 
<br>   The situation in West Asia engaged the constant attention of  
the UN General Assembly and the Security Council during 1985. In  
pursuance of General Assembly 
<br>-40&gt; 
 
<br><br>Resolution 39/49D, on the question of organisation and convening  
of the international peace conference on the Middle East, the  
Secretary General addressed a communication to the President of  
the Security Council seeking the views of the Council on action  
to be taken for the implementation of this Resolution. In his  
response to the Secretary General, the Permanent Representative  
of India, in its capacity as Council President for February 1985,  
after due consultations, indicated that almost all members were  
in favour, in principle, of holding such a conference. While many  
of these members felt that it should be convened as early as  
possible, others considered that the conditions that would make  
it possible to convene such a conference had not yet been met.  
The Secretary General was invited to continue his consultations  
on the subject in any manner he deemed appropriate. 
 
 <br><br>  Formal meetings of the Security Council were held to consider  
the situation in the Middle East, the developments in Lebanon and  
in occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. The Council  
approved the extension of the mandates of United Nations Interim  
Force in Lebanon and United Nations Disengagement Observers  
Force. 
 
  <br><br> The Council held several other meetings to consider the West  
Asian situation including the Israeli bombing of the Palestinian  
camps in Tunisia and the "Achille Lauro" incident. Meetings of  
the Security Council were also held in pursuance of the decision  
taken at the NAM Ministerial Conference at Luanda to consider the  
situation in West Asia. 
 
   <br><br>The General Assembly adopted seven resolutions on the two  
items-"The question of Palestine" and the "Situation in the  
Middle East" co-sponsored by India and several other Non-aligned  
countries. The Indian representative drew attention to the sense  
of indignation and outrage of the overwhelming majority of the  
member States of the UN and the international community in  
general, over the continued and defiant refusal of Israel, in  
violation of its Charter obligations, to comply with relevant UN  
resolutions. He placed on record India's consistent support for  
the people of Palestine and the Arab cause. 
 
  <br><br> Namibia and the situation in South Africa remained an active  
subject for discussion both at the United Nations and in the Non- 
aligned Movement. They also dominated the proceedings at Nassau,  
CHOGM. The Extra-ordinary Ministerial Meeting of the NAM  
Coordinating Bureau held in New Delhi on the question of Namibia  
from 19 to 21 April 1985 adopted an important Declaration and a  
Programme of Action on Namibia besides adopting a statement  
condemning South Africa's decision to establish an "Interim  
Government" in Namibia. In pursuance to this Conference, the  
Security Council held an urgent meeting from 10 to 19 June 1985  
to consider the Namibian question. In response to the decision of  
the New Delhi meeting that the Security Council's discussions be  
represented at high level, 18 Ministers of the Non-aligned  
countries addressed the Council. The Security Council once again  
discussed this item as the follow-up of the decisions taken at  
the NAM Ministerial Conference at Luanda in September 1985. While  
the first meeting of the Security Council adopted a resolution 
<br>-41&gt; 
 
<br><br>warning South Africa that the failure to implement UN resolutions  
could compel the Security Council to consider adoption of  
appropriate measures under the Charter, the second meeting of the  
Council, failed to adopt the Non-aligned resolution in view of  
the veto by U.K. and U.S.A. who had earlier abstained on the  
first resolution. The General Assembly was equally concerned with  
the subject and adopted six resolutions on the subject including  
a resolution calling for a special session of the General Assemly  
in 1986 to consider Namibian independence. The South African  
Government's imposition of the State of Emergency in 36 districts  
of the country led to another meeting of the Security Council in  
July 1985 which urged the members to adopt measures against South  
Africa including suspension of all new investments, restriction  
in the field of sports and cultural relations, suspension of  
guaranteed export loan and prohibition of new contracts in the  
nuclear field and all sales of computer equipments that might be  
used by the South African army and police. This imposition of  
emergency was also considered by NAM Coordinating Bureau at its  
urgent meeting on 27 July 1985. NAM Coordinating Bureau held  
several meetings on this occasion to consider Namibian issue and  
the South Africa's repressive measures against black majority in  
South Africa. India's concern for the people of South Africa was  
underlined by the Prime Minister himself when he addressed the  
specially convened meeting of the Committee on Apartheid at the  
UN. At Nassau, the Prime Minister gave a call for adoption of  
comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Apartheid regime  
and helped to negotiate the Commonwealth Accord on South Africa.  
It was because of the India's forceful stand on this crucial  
issue that the Conference could not sidetrack the South African  
issue and it dominated even the week-end Retreat discussions. 
 
  <br><br> During the year under review, the representative of India  
continued as a member of the Task Force on Political Prisoners,  
Task Force on Women and Children and also as member of the  
Advisory Committee of the United Nations Educational and Training  
Programme for Southern Africa. 
 
  <br><br> The debate on the question of apartheid in the 40th session of  
the General Assembly was based mainly on the report of the  
Special Committee against Apartheid. Seven draft resolutions were  
drafted by the Special Committee and two others by Finland and  
Sweden. One resolution was adopted without a vote (UN Trust Fund  
for South Africa). The other eight resolutions were adopted by  
large majorities. 
 
   <br><br>South Africa's aggression against Angola during the year  
resulted in the adoption of as many as 4 separate Security  
Council resolutions. Resolution 567 (1985) unanimously adopted on  
20 June 1985 condemned South Africa for its act of aggression  
committed in May 1985 against Angola and for the use of the  
international territory of Namibia as a springboard for  
perpetrating such attacks. Resolution 571 (1985) unanimously  
adopted on 20 September 1985 condemned South Africa for its  
"persistent, premeditated and sustained armed invasion" of Angola  
and its flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial  
integrity of that country. Resolution 574 (1985) also adopted  
unanimously on 7 October 1985 strongly condemned South Africa for  
perpetrating 
<br>-42&gt; 
 
<br><br>acts of aggression against Angola, called upon all States to  
implement fully arms embargo imposed against South Africa as  
called for in Security Council Resolution 418 (1977) and  
requested the Commission of Investigation established in  
pursuance of Resolution 571 consisting of Australia, Egypt and  
Peru to report urgently on its evaluation of the damage resulting  
from South Africa's aggression. In the fourth unanimous  
resolution on the subject, Resolution 577 (1985) the Security  
Council endorsed the report of its Commission of Investigation  
and demanded that South Africa pay full and adequate compensation  
to Angola for the damage to life and property resulting from its  
acts of aggression. 
 
   <br><br>On a request from Botswana, the Security Council held an  
urgent meeting on 21 June 1985 to consider South Africa's  
aggression against Botswana. The Council unanimously adopted  
Resolution 568 (1985) which strongly condemned South Africa for  
its unprovoked and unwarranted military attack on Botswana's  
capital on 14th June 1985. 
 
  <br><br> The overall situation in the Central American region remained  
equally critical and volatile during the period under review. The  
Security Council considered the extremely serious situation" in  
the Central American region from 8 to 10 May 1985 at the request  
of Nicaragua. The representative of India on 9 May 1985  
emphasised that peace in Central America could not rest on the  
foundation of policies of intervention, interference and  
intimidation or that of threat of use of force, nor of coercive  
measures of any kind whatsoever. India supported the efforts of  
the Contadora Group for obtaining lasting peace in the region. 
 
  <br><br> The Council met again on 10 December 1985 at the request of  
Nicaragua which complained of "the extremely serious situation  
created by the escalation of acts of aggression" against  
Nicaragua by the United States. India participated in the debate  
alongwith other Non-aligned countries in a show of solidarity  
with Nicaragua. In the absence of any agreement among the  
countries of the Contadora, no draft resolution could be  
submitted to the Council for its consideration and debate ended  
without any decision. Similarly, during the consideration of the  
question by the General Assembly no consensus could be reached on  
a possible draft resolution and as such the Assembly could not  
take any action on the item.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br> The United Nations once again considered the question of  
Afghanistan and adopted a Resolution by 122 votes in favour, 19  
against and 12 abstentions. India, as in previous years,  
abstained. The Indian delegate once again stressed the need to  
prevent escalation of tensions in the region and to take  
effective action to defuse them. He urged all concerned to work  
for the evolution of a political solution based on a dialogue  
between the parties directly involved. 
 
  <br><br> The situation in Kampuchea also received attention in the  
General Assembly. While a number of delegations, including India,  
expressed their reservations on the credentials of "Democratic  
Kampuchea," there was no formal move in the General 
<br>-43&gt; 
 
<br><br>Assembly to challenge its credentials. The substantive resolution  
on Kampuchea wa s adopted by 114 votes in favour, 21 against and  
16 abstentions. India abstained on the ground that the adoption  
of a resolution that satisfied only one side, would obstruct  
rather than encourage constructive contacts. India advocated a  
comprehensive political solution, based on the principles and  
framework accepted at the Seventh Nonaligned Summit in Delhi. 
 
  <br><br> The UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution  
requesting the Ad-hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean "to complete  
preparatory work relating to the Conference on the Indian Ocean  
during 1986 in order to enable the opening of the Conference at  
Colombo at an early date soon thereafter, but not later than  
1988, to be decided by the Committee in consultation with the  
host country". The Resolution further emphasised that the  
Conference and the establishment and maintenance of the Indian  
Ocean as a Zone of Peace required the full and active  
participation and cooperation of all the permanent members of the  
Security Council, the major maritime users and the littoral and  
hinterland states. 
 
  <br><br> The Debate on the Antarctica revealed widespread concern among  
the developing countries on the question. Some countries stressed  
that Antarctica was a common heritage of mankind and required a  
new regime. The Antarctic Consultative Parties highlighted the  
positive role of the Treaty and stressed that the Antarctic  
Treaty regime has preserved international peace and security,  
promoted peaceful cooperation and scientific research in the  
area, reconciled conflicting territorial claims and maintained  
the area as a nuclear free zone. Three resolutions tabled by the  
Non-aligned, developing countries, were adopted under this item.  
These resolutions, inter alia, request the Secretary General to  
up-date and expand the study on the question of Antarctica,  
affirm that any exploitation of the resources of Antarctica  
should ensure, inter alia, the equitable sharing of the benefits  
of such exploitation and call for the exclusion of South Africa  
from the meetings of the consultative parties. India voted in  
favour of the third resolution. 
 
   <br><br>The thirteenth meeting of the Antarctic Consultative Parties  
held in Brussels from 7 to 18 October 1985 considered a number of  
matters concerning the impact of man's activities in the  
Antarctic environment and matters relating to the operation of  
the Antarctic Treaty. Questions relating to the establishment of  
a permanent infrastructure and sharing of costs of such an  
infrastructure and the conference activities were also considered  
on a preliminary basis. 
 
  <br><br> The debate on the agenda item dealing with the Iran-Iraq  
conflict was once again postponed to a resumed session in  
consultation with the parties concerned. The ongoing hostilities  
between Iran and Iraq however, engaged the attention of the  
Security Council during 1985. In January 1985, the reports of the  
missions investigating the conditions of POWs in Iran and Iraq  
and of the inspection of attacks on civilian areas were brought  
to the notice of the Security Council. In March 1985, the Council 
<br>-44&gt; 
 
<br><br>President issued a statement appealing to both Iran and Iraq to  
exercise restraint and to continue to honour their undertakings  
to the Security Council not to attack civilian areas. During the  
same month, the Secretary General put forward his 8-point  
proposal to both the parties for finding a comprehensive  
settlement of the war. In April 1985 the Council President issued  
a statement condemning renewed use of chemical weapons in the  
conflict. 
 
 <br><br>  The year 1985 was celebrated as the 25th anniversary of the  
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries  
and Peoples. To mark the occasion, the Special Committee on  
Decolonisation conducted two regional seminars at Port Moresby  
(Papua New Guinea) and at Havana (Cuba) to focus mainly on the  
implementation of the Declaration with respect to the remaining  
territories in these regions. Similarly, the Special Committee  
held an extra-ordinary plenary session at Tunis from 13 to 17 May  
1985. 
 <br><br>
   During the 40th session of the General Assembly, in a series  
of decisions on decolonisation issues, the Assembly called for  
renewed efforts to complete the implementation of its 1960  
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries  
and Peoples; strongly condemned South Africa's continued illegal  
occupation of Namibia and called for an end to collaboration with  
South Africa and reiterated its call for the cessation of foreign  
economic and military activities that hinder the decolonisation  
process. In addition to the two main resolutions under this  
agenda item, one relating to the implementation of the  
Declaration and the other on Dissemination of Information on  
Decolonisation, both of which were co-sponsored by India, the  
Assembly also adopted this year a third resolution on the 25th  
anniversary of the Declaration. 
 
  <br><br> The Assembly on 27 November, also adopted a resolution on  
Malvinas by a vote of 107 in favour, 4 against and 41  
abstentions. The Resolution was co-sponsored by India and several  
other Non-aligned countries. 
 
 <br><br>  India, as one of the 10 globally most advanced countries, was  
a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board  
of Governors. The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr.  
Ramanna in his speech at the General Conference highlighted the  
need for nuclear power and emphasised that Regional Cooperative  
Agreement (RCA) for countries in Asia and the Pacific should  
devote more attention to the development of nuclear power in  
these countries. He rejected the socalled non-proliferation  
measures of the NPT, which actually legitimise the possession of  
nuclear weapons by some states. He underlined that if the NPT was  
to be effective it must apply equally to all countries. India was  
concerned about recent developments of continuing extension of  
supplier restraints and conditions on transfers of nuclear  
materials, equipment and technology, which could only negatively  
affect the fundamental promotional aspect of the IAEA. The report  
of the International Atomic Energy 
<br>-45&gt; 
 
<br><br>Agency for 1984 was presented by its Director General Dr. Hans  
Blix at the 40th session of the United Nations General Assembly  
on 31 October 1985. 
 
<br><br>Economic Issues 
 
 <br>The overall climate before the start of the 40th General  
Assembly session was somewhat better than at the same time in  
1984. There had been some improvement in the world economic  
situation, particularly in the industrialized countries. However,  
it was also clear that the piecemeal measures taken towards the  
debt problem were inadequate and that developing countries  
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa continued to face major  
problems. Monetary and exchange instability and increasing  
protectionism were creating difficulties for the industrialized  
countries themselves. There was general agreement that sustained  
economic growth was required to overcome the world's economic  
problems. Beyond this common understanding, however, there was  
little progress in concrete areas. 
 
  <br><br> The virtual standstill in international economic negotiations  
in UN fora continued in 1985. The Western industrialised  
countries particularly the United States remain unwilling to  
enter into serious negotiations in the UN and the North-South  
dialogue is increasingly confined to the specialized economic  
fora like GATT, IMF and the World Bank. Their inclination is to  
use the United Nations only as a foium for general discussion and  
debate but not for serious negotiations or decisions.  
Increasingly evident also is the desire of major industrialised  
countries to reach agreements on far-reaching issues only among  
themselves without fully involving the multilateral system.  
Because of their serious economic problems, many developing  
countries have come under pressure from developed countries. 
 
  <br><br> As Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, India actively  
supported efforts towards adoption of the Declaration at the  
Ministerial Meeting of the Non-aligned Countries in Angola and  
the positions taken by Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  
which was held immediately prior to the General Assembly session  
in New York. Strenuous efforts were made to pursue the decisions  
of the Seventh Nonaligned Summit held in New Delhi particularly  
in the areas of money, finance and trade and towards the  
convening of the International Conference on Money and Finance  
for Development. 
 
  <br><br> Partly in order to revitalise the dialogue on important  
international economic issues in the United Nations, India along  
with some other developing countries called for a discussion on  
the inter-related issues of money finance, debt, trade, resource  
flows and development to examine international cooperation in  
these vital areas in a coherent and integrated manner. This  
became the theme for special focus during the meetings 
<br>-46&gt; 
<br> 
of the Economic and Social Council. The discussion on these broad  
range of areas was continued during the exercise on the review  
and appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the  
Third United Nations Development Decade. India worked closely  
with the Chairman of the Group of 77 and the Chairman of the  
Committee to reach an agreed consensus conclusion of this  
important exercise. Such a positive outcome had seemed doubtful  
during the two years of protracted negotiations on this issue and  
India was encouraged at this development. 
 
 <br><br>  At the 40th session of the General Assembly, the resolutions  
in the areas of Money and Finance, the Debt Problem and  
International Trade in Commodities could not be fully negotiated  
and have been deferred to a resumed session of the Second  
Committee of the General Assembly to take place sometime in May  
1986. Consensus was, however, possible in some important areas  
but mainly because the action sought was of limited or procedural  
nature such as food and agriculture, substantial and new plan of  
action for the least developed countries, development of energy  
resources and science and technology. 
 
 <br><br>  This year's General Assembly also adopted by consensus a  
resolution on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa. The  
General Assembly decided to hold a special session at the  
ministerial level on this subject in May 1986. The Non-aligned  
Movement had strongly supported the call for such a special  
session made by the OAU Summit Conference of the African leaders. 
 
  <br><br> The Pledging Conference for the Operational Activities for  
Development this year showed an increase in nominal term in the  
pledges for the major funds and programmes of the United Nations.  
Partly this was attributable to exchange rate variations. The  
financial situation of many of these important programmes has,  
however, stabilised. The United Nations Fund for Population  
Activities continues to face a difficult situation because of the  
withholding of a significant portion of its contribution by the  
United States, and considerable uncertainty about its future  
pledge to this fund. 
 
  <br><br> India continued to stress the importance of increased South- 
South cooperation among the developing countries. India was  
involved at the Inter-governmental Follow-up and Coordination  
Committee meeting in Jakarta which laid down improved procedures  
for the promotion of Economic Cooperation among Developing  
Countries (ECDC). A major development in this area was the  
holding of a Ministerial Conference on Global System of Trade  
Preferences (GSTP) which was hosted by India in July 1985. The  
meeting provided an important impetus to the ongoing work on GSTP  
and in promoting trade among developing countries. A meeting of  
participating institutions in the Research Information System of  
NAM (RIS) was also held in Delhi in November 1985.

<tr><td><p align="justify"><br><br>Social and Humanitarian Issues 
 
   In conformity with the principles enshrined in our  
Constitution, India continued to take an active interest in  
social issues, both in the United Nations General Assembly and  
other UN fora. As Chairman of the NAM India helped in co- 
ordinating the Non-aligned positions, particularly on issues  
relating to South Africa, the Middle East and the Right to  
Development as a human right. 
 
   <br><br>India was also involved in the adoption of a Draft Declaration  
on the Human Rights of Individuals who are not Nationals of the  
Country in which they live and also contributed to the ongoing  
negotiations on the Right to Development defending the principles  
of socio-economic justice and national sovereignty over natural  
resources for all countries as also in urging the world community  
to accede to the International Covenant on Human Rights and the  
International Covenant on Suppression and Punishment of the Crime  
of Apartheid and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial  
Discrimination as well as contributing to the drafting of a  
Convention on the Rights of the Child and those of Migrant  
Workers. 
 
  <br><br> In the Third Committee where seventy resolutions were adopted,  
India co-sponsored several resolutions relating to racism,  
apartheid, plight of refugees, the fund for development of women,  
control of drug trafficking and on the use of scientific and  
technological developments. India helped ensure the adoption of  
several other important resolutions, both on socio-economic  
issues as well as those on the right to selfdetermination, youth,  
torture, ieligious intolerance and human rights. A resolution on  
National Institutions for the promotion and protection of human  
rights initiated by India was adopted without a vote in the  
General Assembly. 
 <br><br>
   The Indian delegation continued to voice its concern at the  
deteriorating situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms  
in the world. In the General Assembly, India came forward  
strongly in defending the rights of the people of South Africa  
and expressed our abhorrence of the system of apartheid. On the  
problem of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, India called for a  
viable political solution and avoidance of violence. We supported  
the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and hoped that  
the spirit of democracy would continue to prevail in the ongoing  
talks between the Sri Lanka authorities and the Tamil leaders of  
Sri Lanka. For the first time, the situation of human rights in  
Afghanistan and Iran came up for discussion at the General  
Assembly. India emphasized the need for a political solution to  
the problem and the principle of non-interference in the internal  
affairs of States. 
 
  <br><br> India highlighted the continued colonisation of Namibia and  
the sufferings of the Palestinians in the territories occupied by  
Israel. India joined the developing countries in calling for the  
adoption of the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the  
Advancement of Women and participated actively in the work  
relating to the Second Decade 
<br>-48&gt; 
 
<br>to combat racism, the role of youth, the world social situation  
and policies and programmes relating to crime prevention,  
disabled persons, refugees, the campaign against drugs and the  
international Covenant on Human Rights and the establishment of a  
New International Economic Order. 
 
  <br><br> India's concerns were reiterated at the 41st session of the  
Commission on Human Rights held in February-March 1985 in Geneva.  
Human Rights violations in Southern Africa, Namibia and Palestine  
were once again highlighted. 
 <br><br>
   A number of new initiatives in the human rights field were  
taken during the 38th session of the Sub-Commission on Prevention  
of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities held in Geneva in  
August 1985. Another resolution in the context of the Bhopal  
tragedy under the item Human Rights and Technological  
Developments, adopted by consensus, underscored the objective of  
having uniformity of standards in the application of  
technological processes in all parts of the world so that there  
was no discrepancy between the standards adopted in developed and  
developing countries. The Resolution requires the Secretary  
General to place before the Sub-Commission next year information  
on the existing practices followed by transnational corporations  
and enterprises regarding disclosure by them of all the  
information at their disposal on the actual and potential hazards  
of their promsses, products and technologies to governments,  
employees, consumers and the general public. 
 
<br><br>Administrative Matters 
 
 <br>  The Indian delegation to the Fifth Committee played a  
constructive role in keeping with the realities confronting the  
United Nations on budgetary and administrative issues as well as  
in helping the developing countries to evolve positions which  
would be more balanced. 
 
 <br><br>  India was one of the countries involved in assisting in the  
rediafting of the socalled "Japanese proposal" to "review the  
efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the  
UN" as well as in obtaining a consensus for the resolution as it  
was finally adopted. This resolution now sets up a Group of  
Inter-Govemmental Experts who in the next 8 months would look  
into matters which would assist in further improving the  
efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the  
United Nations. The developing countries would have to look  
seriously at methodologies which could be proposed to the, Groutp  
to assist in achieving a greater degree of political balance  
while preserving thd basic principles of the UN Charter. 
 <br><br>
   In the area of personnel questions, India's efforts were  
directed towards adoption of a resolution which, inter alia,  
requested the Secretary General to submit to the General Assembly  
at its 41st session proposals for reviewing the system of  
desirable ranges for the geographical distribution of staff with  
a view to achieving a balanced application of all factors  
relevant to the calculation of the desirable ranges. 
<br>-49&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  An item that evoked a keen debate in the Sixth Committee was  
the report of the Secretary General on 'Measures to Prevent  
International Terrorism'. The delegates of the Sixth Committee  
voiced concern at the increasing incidence of acts of  
international terrorism and were unanimous in condemnation  
thereof. A draft resolution was adopted by the Sixth Committee by  
a vote of 118 to 1, with 2 abstentions. Unlike in the past, this  
year there was a remarkable change in the attitude-of member  
states in dealing with this menance, for all acts, methods and  
practices of terrorism, wherever and by whomsoever committed,  
were unequivocally condemned as criminal. India played a vital  
role in moulding a compromise between Cuba and Colombia on the  
one side and the West on the other side. 
 
 <br><br>  The Sixth Committee also held a lengthy debate on the draft  
Code of Offences against the peace and security of Mankind.  
Although it was inscribed as a separate item, it was discussed  
together with another item entitled "Report of the International  
Law Commission on the work of its thirty-seventh session" because  
the International Law Commission itself had prepared the Draft  
Code of Offences against the Peace and Security of Mankind. In  
the course of the debate, India condemned terrorism in all forms  
wherever and by whomsoever committed and also made a reference to  
mercenary schools where terrorists were trained. The statement by  
India was well received. 
 
<br><br>Specialised Agencies 
 
  <br> India was elected to the Commission on Human Rights during the  
first regular session of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)  
held in May 1985 in New York. 
 
 <br><br>  At the invitation of the ILO, the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv  
Gandhi, addressed the 71st International Labour Conference in  
Geneva on 17 June 1985. Stressing the importance of the ILO's  
contribution in advancing the cause of social justice, the Prime  
Minister expressed the hope that the work which ILO had initiated  
for the weak, the unemployed and the unorganised would be further  
enlarged. 
 <br><br>
   During the year India continued to participate activcly in ILO  
activities. A tripartite delegation from India led by Shri T.  
Anjaiah, former Minister of Labour, attended the 71 st session of  
the International Labour Confernee held in Geneva in June 1985. A  
representative of the Government of India chaired the ILO  
Governing Body till the expiry of his term in June 1985. 
 
  <br><br> India contributed in particular to the working of WHO  
programme on Human Reproduction, Tropical Diseases Research, and  
Diarrhoeal Diseases. A delegation led by Shrimati Mohsina Kidwai,  
Minister of Health and Family Welfare, participated in the  
deliberations of the 38th World Health Assembly held in Geneva in  
May 1985. 
<br>-50&gt; 
 
<br><br>Nassau-1985 
 
   <br>The Commonwealth Heads of Government met at Nassau (the  
Bahamas) from 16-22 November 1985. There was an impressive  
gathering of leaders from Commonwealth countries specially  
Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia. Among the important leaders  
who attended were the Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada,  
Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Zimbabwe  
while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zambia were iepresented by their  
Presidents. India was represented by Prime Shri Rajiv Gandhi. 
 
  <br><br> Consideration of possible Commonwealth action against South  
Africa in order to pressurise the racist South African regime to  
dismantle apartheid and vacate its illegal occupation of Namibia  
dominated the Nassau CHOGM. 
 
   <br><br>The Prime Minister's key note address was the point of  
departure for the suggestion made at CHOGM that leaders adopt a  
separate declaration on a world order. A working group at Foreign  
Ministers' level, chaired by India's Foreign Minister and  
consisting of UK, Malaysia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Guyana, Canada and  
New Zealand prepared the draft which led to the adoption of the  
Nassau Declaration of World Order. 
 
<br><br>Activities of the Non-aligned Movement 
 
  <br> During the period under review, the Movement of Non-aligned  
Countries remained actively seized of developments in various  
parts of the world, particularly in Southern Africa, the Middle  
East, Central America and Cyprus. In conformity with and in  
pursuance of the decisions taken by it at the Seventh Summit, the  
Movement focused efforts towards promotion of nuclear  
disarmament, and international economic cooperation for  
development. 
 
  <br><br> Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi, as the Chairman of the  
Movement, addressed a special Plenary Meeting of Non-aligned  
Countries at the United Nations Headquarters on 22 October 1985  
on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations.  
The Non-aligned caucus in the Security Council, consisting of  
Non-aligned members of the Council in 1985 including India,  
played an important and dynamic role in the, deliberations of the  
Council on several issues. it also took a number of follow-up  
measures in the implementation of the Action Programme for  
Economic Cooperation adopted by Seventh Conference of Heads of  
State or Government of Non-aligned Countries held at New Delhi in  
March 1983. 
 
</p></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>Within the Security Council the Non-aligned countries actively  
participated in the consideration of the situation in the Middle  
East, developments in Lebanon and in the occupied Palestinian and  
Arab territories and expressed grave concern over the 
<br>-51&gt; 
 
<br><br>continuing Israeli policy of establishing illegal settlements in  
the occupied territories and the widespread and frequent  
violations by Israel of the rights of the Palestinian people in  
contravention of the relevant General Assembly and Security  
Council resolutions as well as established norms of international  
law. They called for a just and comprehensive solution of the  
Middle East problem on the basis of the inalienable right to  
self-determination of the Palestinian people and their right to a  
home-land. 
 
 <br><br>  The Coordinating Bureau held an urgent session in New York on  
6 March 1985 to consider the situation in the areas occupied by  
Israel in Southern Lebanon, the Western Bekaa and the Rashaya  
district. In the communique adopted on the occasion the Bureau  
expressed its grave concern at the deteriorating situation which  
threatened peace and security in these areas. 
 
 <br><br>  The Non-aligned Committee of Eight on Palestine met in New  
Delhi on 20 April 1985 at Ministerial level. The Ministers were  
given a comprehensive briefing by Mr. Yasser Arafat, Chairman of  
the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization  
on the current situation. 
 
  <br> A special plenary meeting of the Movement was held in New York  
on 17 May 1985 in which the Foreign Minister of Argentina made a  
statement on the Question of the Malvinas Islands. 
 
  <br><br> The Seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- 
aligned Countries held at New Delhi had mandated the Coordinating  
Bureau of the Movement to closely monitor events in the Central  
American subregion. A group of 'Friends of the Chairman,'  
comprising 13 countries, with a purely advisory role and  
subordinated to the Bureau itself, was constituted by the Bureau  
in 1984 to assist the Chairman in following the evolving  
situation in Central America. In response to an invitation from  
the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, sevral members of the group  
visited Nicaragua from 29 March to 1 April 1985. The Chairman of  
the Coordinating Bureau submitted a report to the Bureau on the  
visit. 
 
  <br><br> An urgent meeting of the Coordinating Bureau was held on 26  
July 1985 to consider the latest developments relating to the  
situation in Central America, particularly in and around  
Nicaragua. The meeting adopted a communique on the occasion. 
 
   <br><br>The Deputy Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, Mr. Victor Hugo  
Tinoco. addressed a meeting of the Coordinating Bureau on 9  
December 1985 and apprised members of the situation in and around  
Nicaragua. 
 
  <br> On 18 June 1985, the official spokesman of the Government of  
India on behalf of the Chairman of the Movement, issued a  
statement expressing concern over new 5 EA/35-9 
<br>-52&gt; 
 
<br>developments in the part of the Republic of Cyprus under foreign  
occupation, in particular the holding of a "referendum" on 5 May  
1985, the "Presidential elections" of 9 June 1985 and the  
proposed "Parliamentary elections". 
 
  <br><br> The Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-aligned Countries  
was held from 4 to 8 September 1985 at Luanda in Angola. The  
Conference made an analysis and assessment of the current  
international political and economic situation, and reviewed the  
implementation of the decisions of the Seventh Summit Conference  
of Heads of State or Government held in New Delhi and subsequent  
Ministerial and other meetings of the Non-aligned Countries. The  
Conference decided by consensus that the venue of the next summit  
would be Harare. 
 
   <br><br>A Commemorative meeting was held in New York on 13 September,  
1985 to observe the Day of Non-alignment. The meeting was  
addressed inter by the President of the General Assembly and the  
Secretary General of the United Nations. 
 
   <br><br>The Meeting of Ministers and Heads of Delegation of the Non- 
aligned Countries to the Fortieth Session of the United Nations  
General Assembly was held at New York on 1 October 1985. 
 
  <br><br> The Movement's efforts to promote contacts amongst leaders for  
addressing issues of concern to the international community led  
to a proposal to urge summit-level participation on the occasion  
of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. This way in  
keeping with the importance that the Non-aligned countries have  
consistently accorded to the role of the United Nations. It was  
also a natural follow-up measure to the New Delhi Declaration  
which had called on the international community to observe 1985  
as the Year of the United Nations. The unique gathering of a  
significant number of world leaders at New York in October 1985  
on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  
provided a valuable  opportunity for interaction between Heads of  
State or Government. Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi, who  
attended the commemoration, besides meeting a large number of  
leaders, addressed the United Nations General Assembly and a  
special plenary meeting of Non-aligned countries. 
 
  <br><br> A number of meetings of the Non-aligned were held in the  
implementation of the Action Programme on Economic Cooperation  
that was adopted at the New Delhi Summit. 
 <br><br>
   The group of meetings of the Non-aligned countries in the  
sphere of Standardisation Measurement and Quality Control was  
held in New Delhi from 23 to 31 January 1985, The meetings  
included (a) Second Meeting of Experts, (b) Fifth Meeting of the  
Coordinating Countries, (c) Workshop on Standardisation and  
Quality Assurance, and (d) Meetings of the Functional Groups. The  
Meeting of the Coordinating Countries reviewed the composition of  
the Functional Groups and sought to coordinate positions relating  
to international organisations. 
<br>-53&gt; 
 
  <br><br> An important development during the year was the finalisation  
of the Statute of the Non-aligned Centre for Science and  
Technology of the Non-aligned and other Developing Countries.  
Several plenary meetings of the Movement were held at New York to  
give the Statute its final shape. A Plenipotentiary Conference  
was held in New York on 4 February 1985 to adopt the Final Act.  
So far 25 countries have signed the Statute. 
 <br>
   The ninth meeting of Coordinators of Non-aligned Countries in  
the field of Health was held at Havana from 23 to 28 March 1985. 
 
   <br><br>The ninth meeting of Health Ministers of Non-aligned Countries  
was held in Geneva on 8 May 1985 during the 38th session of the  
World Health Assembly. The meeting reviewed the progress made in  
the implementation of the Strategies of Health for All by the  
year 2000 and the items of the agenda of the 38th World Health  
Assembly. 
 
 <br><br>  As recommended by the New Delhi Summit, the International  
Centre for Public Enterprises (ICPE), Ljubljana, prepared a study  
on the Role of Women in Development. This was to serve as a  
reference in the preparations for the World Conference on Women  
held in Nairobi. An open ended Ministerial-level meeting of the  
Non-aligned and other Developing Countries was held in New Delhi  
from 8 to 11 April 1985, prior to the World Conference on Women,  
with a view to coordinating aspects of common interest.

 <br><br>  The Coordinating Bureau on 9 January 1985, established an  
Action Committee to formulate a Plan of Action for a concrete  
initiative by Non-aligned Countries for cooperation to meet  
thecritical economic situation in Africa. The Action Committee  
met on 21 February, 27 February and 6 March 1985. The Extra- 
ordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau on the  
Question of Namibia, heldin New Delhi from 19 to 21 April 1985,  
adopted the reports of the Action Committee and the Plan of  
Action of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries to meet the  
Critical Economic Situation in Africa. 
 
  <br> Offers!.of assistance have been received from Algeria,  
Argentina, Bangladesh, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Libya,  
Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru and Yugoslavia. The coordination  
of these offers is being carried out by India in its capacity as  
the Focal Point for the Plan of Action, The Focal Point is  
presently coordinating the execution of 9 projects in 7 African  
countries identified from the FAO compilation on the  
Rehabilitation of Agriculture in Africa. 
<br>-54&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  The Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-aligned Countries  
held at Luand a, Angola, in September 1985, inter alia, discussed  
the international economic situation. It also reviewed the state  
of implementation of the Action Programme for Economic  
Cooperation of the Non-aligned Countries and noted with  
satisfaction the progress made towards its implementation since  
the seventh Non-aligned Summit. 
 
  <br><br> The Luanda Ministerial Meeting had taken clear decisions on  
pursuing the implementation of the 7th Summit initiative for the  
convening of an International Conference on Money and Finance for  
Development and on measures to be pursued for resolving the  
critical conditions arising out of the indebtedness of developing  
countries. The objective was that at the 40th UN General  
Assembly, the Group of 77 should try and achieve clear mandates  
in both these areas. India was able to ensure that the directions  
that had emerged out of the Luanda Ministerial meeting were  
clearly and positively reflected in the programme of work of the  
Group of 77, as incorporated in the Ministerial communique of the  
Group of 77 adopted in relation to the 40th UN General Assembly.

   During 1985 the Preparatory Commission for the  International  
Sea-bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of  
the Sea (PREPCOM) continued its work. It held its third session  
in two parts, viz., from 11 March to 4 April 1985 at Kingston,  
Jamaica and from 12 August to 4 September 1985 in Geneva. India  
was represented at both these sessions. 
 
   <br><br>During both these sessions Chairman Warioba held extensive  
informal consultations with concerned delegations including India  
with a view to finding a solution to the problem of overlapping  
of application area of the USSR with that of Japan and the USSR  
with that of France, and for finding a viable mine site for  
activities by the International Sea-bed Authority. While these  
consultations were inconclusive it was agreed that the four  
pioneer investors namely, India, France, Japan and the USSR will  
meet in Geneva in December 1985 to further explore the  
possibility of finding a solution to this problem. The four  
pioneer investors met in Geneva from 2-6 December 1985 and have  
made some progress, towards finding a solution to this vexed  
problem. 
 
 <br><br>  The Informal Plenary of the PREPCOM completed the second  
reading of the draft rules of procedure of the Assembly of the  
International Sea-bed Authority and commenced consideration of  
the draft rules of procedure of the Council of the Authority.The  
four Special Commissions of the PREPCOM continued discussions of  
the subjects allocated to them. 
 
   By a letter dated 10 june 1985 addressed to the Chairman of  
the Preparatory Commission, the USSR had informed that the United  
States had issued a licence to the 
<br>-55&gt; 
 
<br>Consortium Ocean Mining Associates, for exploration in the part  
of the International Sea-bed area in the Pacific Ocean. In this  
context the Preparatory Commission on 30 August 1985 adopted a  
Declaration which was co-sponsored by the Group of 77. This  
Declaration, inter alia, declared that any claim, agreement or  
action regarding the International Sea-bed area and its resources  
undertaken outside the Preparatory,Commission which is  
incompatible with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and its  
related resolutions shall not be recognised. 
 
 <br><br>  At its 40th Session the General Assembly of the United Nations  
adopted a resolution on the Law of the Sea which inter alia took  
note of the Declaration of 30 August 1985 of the Preparatory  
Commission and called upon States to desist from taking actions  
which undermine the Convention or defeat its object and purpose  
and to observe the Provisions of the Convention when enacting  
their national legislation. This resolution was co-sponsored by  
53 States including India. 
 
  <br> The Legal Sub-Committee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful  
Uses of Outer Space held its 24th session in New York from 18  
March to 4 April 1985 and considered legal questions concerning  
remote sensing, nuclear power sources, defining outer space, and  
use of geostationary orbit. 
 
 <br><br>  Regarding legal implications of remote sensing of earth from  
space, the Sub-Committee continued work on, this item using among  
other things, texts submitted by France, Brazil, Chile and Kenya.  
By the end of the deliberations of the working group, its  
chairman was able to present a working document containing a set  
of remote sensing principles which could provide a basis for an  
agreement by consensus in the near future. 
 
  <br> On the nuclear power sources, the Working Group considered  
questions of assistance to States and notification prior to re- 
entry of a space object with a nuclear power source on board.  
Tentative agreement was reached on supplementing two items in the  
format for notification of the malfunctioning of a space object  
with a nuclear power source on board, a format endorsed by the  
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1983. 
 
 <br><br>  Regarding the definition and delimitation of outer space some  
delegations considered that the definition of outer space was  
urgent in view of the fact that legal regimes applicable to air  
space and outer space were radically different in nature. In  
their view, the appropriate course was a multilateral agreement  
which would establish a specific altitude as the upper limit of  
airspace and the commencement of outer space. Other countries  
said that such a definition or delimitation was at present  
unnecessary, because the use for such a definition or  
delimitation was inconclusive and such a boundary would be  
arbitrary. 
 
 <br><br>  Regarding the question of geostationary orbit some delegations  
stated that a special legal regime should be established for the  
orbit . It was a limited natural established for the orbit . it  
was a limited natural resource, as recognized by UNISPACE'82 and  
Article 33 of the International Telecommunications 
<br>-56&gt; 
 
<br><br>Union (ITU) Convention, and ITU arrangements on the allocation of  
orbital positions and related frequencies on a "first come, first  
served" basis were unacceptable. They stated that the orbit was  
approaching saturation with positions and related frequencies  
occupied by only a few countries. Thus principles governing the  
equitable use of the orbit by all countries needed to be  
established by the UN in order that the ITU might make required  
technical allocations of orbital positions and frequencies.  
Equatorial countries said they had a special relation to the  
orbit, which lay on the equatorial plane and was a unique natural  
resource. While recognizing that all countries should have equal  
and equitable opportunities for access to the orbit, they stated  
that equatorial countries had special rights and responsibilities  
with respect to segments of the geostationary orbit suprajacent  
to their territories. There was no agreement on this item. 
 
  <br><br> UNIDROIT (International Institute for Unification of Private  
Law) is an intergovernmental organization situated in Rome. India  
is a member of the Institute. 
 
  <br><br> UNIDROIT convened the first session of its Committee of the  
governmental experts for the preparation of a Convention on  
International Financial Leasing from 15-19 April 1985, as also  
the first session of its other committees of government experts  
for the preparation of a Convention on Certain Aspects of  
International Factoring from 22 to 26 April 1985 which discussed  
the preliminary draft uniform rules on international financial  
leasing and the draft uniform rules on certain aspects of  
international factoring. India participated in both the meetings. 
 
  <br><br> At the elections held during the fortieth session of the UN  
General Assembly in December 1985, India was elected to the  
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. During that  
session Shri Samarendra Nath Sen of India was appointed to the  
United Nations Administrative Tribunal after his election by the  
Fifth Committee. 
 
  <br><br> The Commission held its eighteenth session in Vienna from 3 to  
21 June 1985. Thirty-three member States of the Commission,  
including India, participated in this session. Although several  
items were included in the agenda of the session, Most of the  
time and attention of the Commission was devoted to the  
finalisation of UNCITRAL model law on International Commercial  
Arbitration which was finalised. The Commission also adopted text  
of a model law on International Commercial Arbitration.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>The world economy continues to be in a critical stage. Both  
developing and developed countries have during the last few years  
faced considerable hardship. The developing countries, have,  
however, been the worst sufferers. Growth rates of most countries  
remain depressed; the debt burden of many developing countries  
continues to be at crushing levels; most developing countries are  
experiencing stagnant or declining growth rates, The external  
environment for them is both harsh and adverse. Concessional  
flows for development have declined. Global liquidity has  
decreased and there is a hardening in the conditionality of  
international financial institutions. Barriers against exports  
from developing countries have increased. Commodity prices in  
real terms are at low levels. As a result, the development  
process of most developing countries has been seriously affected.  
The economies of a few industrialised countries have recently  
shown signs of recovery but this has had little impact on the  
rest of the world. Moreover, in the U.S.A. there are already  
signs of an overall economic downturn in growth and production  
(in the first quarter of 1985). The durability of the recovery  
is, therefore, uncertain. A significant dimension in the current  
crisis is the serious erosion of the UN system and multilateral  
development and financial institutions, particularly IDA. The  
dialogue between developed and developing countries, despite the  
best efforts of the latter, has made little or no headway. 
 
  <br><br> The response of the international community to this continuing  
crisis has proved inadequate. While the concept of  
interdependence has been given recognitioneven at summits of  
industrialised countries --there has been little coherent or  
coordinated international action to provide impetus to the  
process of development. Unfortunately there has been a weakening  
of the existing mechanisms of international cooperation for  
development. This has manifested itself in a growing tendency for  
major industrial countries to seek unilateral or bilateral  
solution for their immediate problems and a reduction of support  
for multilateral institutions in the fields of development,  
finance and trade. 
 
  <br><br> Non-aligned and other developing countries have sought in a  
number of ways during the year under review to reverse this trend  
and to strengthen international economic cooperation. 
 
  <br><br> The Seventh Summit of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries  
held in New Delhi in 1983 had made a number of far-reaching  
proposals to deal with the crisis. The 
<br>-58&gt; 
 
<br><br>Economic Declaration of the Seventh Summit had suggested a three  
pronged strategy for promoting international economic cooperation  
i.e launching of global negotiations;(ii) adoption of programme  
of immediate measures in the areas of money and finance, trade  
and raw materials, energy and food; and (iii) intensification of  
economic cooperation among developing countries. 
 
 <br><br>  The most far-reaching proposal was the call for the convening  
of International Conference on Money and Finance for Development  
with universal participation aimed at meeting effectively the  
development and other financial requirements of the international  
economy particularly those of the developing countries and the  
need for growth oriented structural adjustments. A high level  
group set up by the late Prime Minister in her capacity as  
Chairperson of the Movement of Non-aligned countries developed  
this proposal and examined the substantive and procedural issues  
in this regard. 
 
 <br><br>  During the year under review meetings of the Ministers of the  
Movement of Non-aligned countries and the Group of 77 emphasised  
the importance of convening the International Conference on Money  
and Finance for Development with universal participation and in  
this context expressed appreciation for the initiative taken by  
the Chairperson of the NAM in setting up the Expert Group. The  
Group of 77 Ministerial Meeting of October 1985 called for  
initiation during the 40th session of the General Assemmbly of  
the preparatory process for convening the International  
Conference, urging the utilisation of all relevant studies and  
proposals. 
 
  <br><br> India, as Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Group of 24  
(Finance Ministers of developing countries in the World Bank and  
IMF) during 1984-85, was able to generate support for the NAM  
proposal in the communique of the Group of 24 at its Ministerial  
meeting in April 1985. 
 
  <br><br> The meetings of the Interim and Development Committees of the  
IMF and world Bank in April 1985 and October 1985, however, did  
not make much headway on the substantive issues of concern to  
developing countries. Some positive decisions were, however,  
taken on specific issues such as the decision to call for an  
expanded role for World Bank and a firm time-table for IDA VIII  
and to examine the reports of G-10 and G-24 on the International  
Monetary and Financial systems. 
 
  <br><br> This was not surprising in view of the fact that the Annual  
Summit meeting of the 7 major industrialised nations in Bonn in  
May 1985 did not reflect any substantive progress on issues of  
concern to developing countries in the sphare of international  
economic relations. The Summit Declaration recognised the concept  
of inter dependance between North and South but paid service only  
to the need for maintaining and, if possible, increasing the flow  
of resources including financial development assistance to the  
third world countries. IDA VII found no mention at all. The focus  
of the Summit was on the proposal for a New Round of Multilateral  
Trade Negotiations which 
<br>-59&gt; 
 </p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align="justify"><br><br>was put forward by some major industrialised countries and on  
which there was a broad agreement among the Seven that these  
should start as soon as possible. 
 
  <br><br> The U.S.A. supported by major industrialised countries has  
been making determined efforts to start a New Round of Trade  
Negotiations under the aegis of GATT which would also include new  
areas particularly trade in services.    Developing countries  
were opposed to this proposal as they maintained that the  
unfinished work of the last round, presently taken up by GATT, be  
completed as also commitments on 'stand. still' and 'roll back'  
on protectionism fulfilled. Developing countries also had  
reservations on the inclusion of new areas particularly trade in  
services and others such as trad related aspects of investments. 
 
   <br><br>At a special meeting of the GATT Contracting Parties in  
September 1985 and the annual session of GATT in November 1985,  
developing countries were pressured into accepting the setting up  
of a Preparatory Committee to consider the agenda, modalities and  
other issues relating to the Proposed Naw Round of Trade  
Negotiations in GATT. 
 
  <br><br> To enable an in-depth examination of the issues in the  
Proposed New Round and with a view to a better coordination of  
positions of developing countries, the Ministry of External  
Affairs assisted the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in  
organising an international colloquium titled the "Proposed New  
Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and Developing  
Countries"in December 1985. The colloquium provided a valuable  
forum for informal exchanges at the level of senior officials  
from important developing countries and concerned international  
organisations, as well as experts in their individual capacities,  
on the subject. The colloquium recommended that the trade issues  
be considered in the wider perspective of issues in the world  
economy as a whole that specific priorities be set by developing  
countries in the Proposed New Round and that services should not  
be included in the GATT. It emphasised the need for continuous  
inter-action among the developing countries on the subject. 
 
  <br><br> The Commonwealth Summit of October 1985 reviewed developments  
in the world economy and specific issues in the North-South  
Dialogue. The Summit recognised the need for stimulating the  
North-South Dialogue. It considered it important "to develop an  
active dialogue on the functioning of international monetary and  
financial system" and noted that the Spring 1986 meeting of the  
Development and Interim committees would provide an opportunity  
for in-depth examination of the relevant issues, in the light of  
the Reports by the Group of 10 (Finance Ministers of developed  
countries) and the Group of 24 (Finance Ministers of developing  
countries). The Commonwealth Summit affirmed the importance of a  
New Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations in the GATT in  
helping to restore confidence in-the multilateral system and  
emphasised the importance of the interests of participants being  
taken into account and respect for the principles enshrined in  
the Tokyo Round. 
<br>-60&gt; 
 
  <br><br> Increasing attention continues to be paid to greater  
cooperation among developing countries both in the Group of 77  
and in the Non-aligned Movement. Intensive efforts are underway  
within the Group of 77 to implement the  
Caracas Programme of Action. One of the important initiatives  
taken under ECDC, in which considerable progress has been made,  
is the establishment of Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)  
for which negotiations have already begun. India hosted a  
Ministerial level meeting in New Delhi on 25-26 July 1985. At  
this Ministerial Meeting in which over 70 countries participated  
with 30 at the level of Ministers, significant political impetus  
was provided to the establishment of the GSTP through concrete  
progress on specific issues such as the establishment of a time- 
table for launching GSTP recommendation 
for an across the board tariff cut upto 10 % and the decision to  
further political level review meetings to maintain the momentum.  
The Ministerial meetirg also adopted a Declaration on the  
international trading environment as it affects trade of  
developing countries. 
 
 <br><br>  An important initiative in the area of ECDC is the proposal  
for the establishment of a Bank of Developing Countries. This  
proposal has, however, been stalled as some countries have taken  
the view that there is no need for the establishment of a new  
financing institution at this stage. 
 
 <br><br>  Another important initiative of the Group of 77 is the  
establishiment of a MultiSectoral Information Network (MSIN) of  
developing countries. The objective of the MSIN is to provide a  
network which would facilitate exchange of development oriented  
information among the developing countries in all major sectors  
of economic activity. Priority has been placed on the TCDC  
component in a proposed pilot project. The MSIN would also  
complement information systems in the UN such as INRES and TIPS.  
The MSIN project has been examined and developed through several  
meetings of experts as well as at inter-governmental level. We  
are also taking steps to ensure that there is the required inter- 
action between the MSIN and the Research and Information System  
(RIS) of the Governments of Non-aligned countries. 
 
 <br><br>  The Inter-governmental Follow-up and Coordination Committee  
held its 4th meeting at Jakarta from 19-23 August 1985. This  
meetiiig of senior officials reviewed progress in the  
implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action. Several  
important recommendations were made especially to provide impetus  
to the GSTP and the MSIN 
 
  <br><br> The Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in October l985  
strongly reaffirmed the belief in collective self-reliance of  
Non-aligned and developing countries and called for specific  
steps on MSIN, GSTP and TCDC. 
 
  <br><br> The Movement of Non-aligned countries in the context of its  
endeavours to promote collective self-reliance among Non-aligned  
and developing countries organised a series of meetings in  
diverse spheres of economic cooperation contained in its Action  
Programme for Economic Cooperation. India played a leading role  
in the 
<br>-61&gt; 
 
<br>furtherance of this objective especially in view of her current  
Chairmanship of NAM ECDC had been a major issue before the  
Seventh Non-aligned Summit. The Summit adopted the important  
Declaration on collective self-reliance and reviewed the  
implementation of the Non-aligned Programme of Action. The NAM  
Ministerial Conference at Luanda sought to further stimulate  
action on ECDC. 
 <br><br>
   India hosted the Second Conference of the Research and  
Information System of Non-aligned and developing countries in  
November 1985. This Conference provided a valuable opportunity  
for an exchange of views on important issues in multilateral  
economic cooperation, cooperation among developing countries and  
the problems of the least developed and low income countries  
especially in Africa. The Conference made important  
recommendations on these issues keeping in view preparations  
forthe Eighth Non-aligned Summit. It also decided to constitute a  
Committee of Six designated institutions of the coordinating  
countries in this sphere. This represented an important step  
towards a net-work of the research and information institutes of  
Nonaligned and developing countries to bring about closer  
coordination of economic research and information in the South. 
 
   In addition India hosted meetings in specific sectors of the  
Action Programme such as sports. 
 
  <br><br> India's keenness to promote cooperation with countries in Asia  
and Africafound expression in bilateral schemes of assistance  
under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC)  
Programme operated by the Ministry of External Affairs. This  
programme supplements multilateral schemes such as the Colombo  
Plan and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan. The  
ITEC Programme, which was launched in 1964 with an outlay of Rs.  
4.46 lakhs, has steadily expanded. It now covers nearly 60  
countries and has a budget allocation of Rs. 9.00 crores for  
1985-86. 
 
  <br><br> The main forms of technical cooperation under ITEC Programme  
are providing training in India, deploying Indian experts abroad,  
undertaking feasibility and technoeconomic studies, financing  
visits of economic delegations, organising workshops and supply  
of equipment. The area of cooperation covers such diverse fields  
as agriculture, natural resources, industry, education, foreign  
trade promotion, banking and insurance, in-service training  
courses etc. 
 </p></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>During 1985-86, 700 slots were earmarked for nominees of  
developing countries for training in specialised Indian  
institutions, and nearly 150 Indian experts were in position in  
developing countries on short or long-term assignments. Some of  
the other ITEC activitieduring 1985-86 were: feasibility studies  
in Ethiopia in the fields of water resources, agriculture and  
livestock; visits of teams of experts to Ethiopia, the  
philippines and Vietnam in the fields of education, smallscale  
inoustries and personnel training respectively; and provision of  
consultancy services for building a conference complex in  
Seychelles. 
<br>-62&gt; 
 
 <br><br>  Among the goods supplied during 1985-86 or the supply of which  
was in the pipeline were a tractor with a complete Ploughing set  
to People's Democratic Republic of Yemen; spinning wheels to  
Sudan; equipment for an industrial project, diesel generating  
sets and musical instruments to Afghanistan; sport goods to  
Jamaica, Montessarrat and Fiji; bicycles to Vietnam; and  
medicines to Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Victnam and Loas. A proposal  
for supply of irrigation pumps to Laos is being processed.  
Delegations received during the year included one from Ethiopia  
in the fields of banking and mining and from Laos in the field of  
industrial development. 
 
  <br><br> The objective of strengthening Technical Cooperation among  
Developing Countries is also pursued through the Ministry playing  
an active role in international organisations. During 1985-86  
representatives of the Ministry made significant contribution to  
meetings on TCDC organised by UNDP in New York and by ESCAP in  
Bangkok where certain specific suggestions made by Indian  
delegations were well received. A representative of the Ministry  
also led an Indian delegation to meeting organised by UNIDO in  
Brundi for industrial development of that country where offers of  
industrial collaboration and technical support in identified  
sectors were made by India. 
 
  <br><br> India's assistance to famine-affected African countries was  
stepped up. The supply of 100,000 tonnes of wheat announced last  
year was completed and action initiated for a further supply of  
foodgrains worth Rs. 12.5 lakhs. 
 
 <br>  An Indian delegation led by Secretary (ER) in the Ministry of  
External Affairs attended the annual Consultative Committee  
meeting of the Southern African Development Coordination  
Conference (SADCC) in Harare in January 1986 and offered  
significant assistance over a five-year periodito the frontline  
states, primarily in the field of agriculture, industry,  
transport, energy and manpower training. These concrete offers of  
support were greatly appreciated. India is already involved in  
several projects in cooperation with ECA (Economic Commission for  
Africa), some of which have already been completed. At the ECA  
meeting in April 1985, India uncertook to implement a new project  
for development of small scale industries in certain African  
countries in the context of the Industrial Development Decade for  
Africa. 
 
 <br><br>  The Ministry played an active role in the deliberations of  
Economic Joint Commission with various countries including  
Mauritius, Ethiopia, Federal Republic of Germany, Afghanistan,  
Qatar and Iran. In the Joint Commission with Mauritius, further  
promotion of technical cooperation and supply of equipment in the  
fields of small scale industry, meteorology, education and health  
services were agreed upon. In the Joint Commission with Ethiopia  
the field of cooperation was also significantly stepped up. 
 
 <br><br>  The Ministry assisted foreign governments in recruiting Indian  
experts, on bilateral basis. It also made its contribution  
towards promotion of Indian economic 
<br>-63&gt; 
 
<br>interests through its representation in bodies such as EXIM Bank,  
Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation (ECGC), Federation of  
Indian Engineering Organisation (FIEO), Indian Institute of  
Foreign Trade (IIFT), Project and Equipment Corporation (PEC),  
Overseas Construction Council of India (OCCI) etc. and was  
involved in various activities and policies relating to the  
country's foreign economic policy in diverse fields.

 <br><br>  Historical Division provides research input into the working  
of the working of the Ministry. It prepares background papers on  
various current international developments and analyses these  
developments in the perspective of the present situation. It is  
also responsible for providing the historical and technical input  
in boundary questions. All the maps on India published abroad are  
monitored for their depiction of India's external boundary and  
wherever a case of wrong depiction comes to notice the matter is  
taken up suitably with the concerned organisations to ensure  
remedial action. 
 
  <br><br> To support the research efforts a well stocked Library exists  
which has over one hundered thousand books and documents in its  
collection. During 1985 alone 1800 books, 400 maps, 600 pamphlets  
and 10 reels of microfilms were added. The Library subscribes to  
558 periodicals (442 foreign and 116 Indian) besides 37 daily  
newspapers (25 foreign and 12 Indian). Back-files of Bangladesh  
Observer (Dhaka), Guardian (Rangoon), Sun (Colombo), Dawn  
(Karachi), Pakistan Times (Rawalpindi), China Daily (Beijing),  
Renmin Ribao (Beijing), Egyptian Gazetted (Cairo), Suna  
(Khartoum), Standard (Nairobi), The Times (London), The  
International Herald Tribune (Hong Kong), Izwestia (Moscow) are  
being maintained. 
 
  <br><br> The Library regularly issues a monthly Chronicle of Events,  
Foreign Affairs Documentation Bulletin and annotated Monthly list  
of Books added to the Library.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>Coverage on India in foreign media seemed to be marked by a  
more positive tone and of a more understanding nature than during  
the previous years. The manner in which the nation has rallied  
following the tragedies of the previous year was widely noted.  
India's efforts to improve relations with neighbouring countries,  
her active role as the Chairman of NAM in promoting an end to  
colonialism in Namibia, disarmament and the New International  
Economic Order as also the attempts made to tackle contentious  
issues within the region by close and friendly contacts with  
neighbouring countries, and, internally, the Punjab and Assam  
accords contributed to this process. The External Publicity  
Division (XP Division) buttressed this positive projection in  
media abroad by supply of high quality print and audio visual  
publicity material. Facilities were also provided in India to  
foreign media personnel. 
 
  <br><br> The accords reached on the Punjab and Assam and the elections  
there were widely publicised. All restrictions on visit to the  
Punjab by accredited foreign correspondents were lifted.  
Necessary facilities were also given to foreign correspondents to  
cover the elections in Assam. 
 
  <br><br> 135 media personnel from the participating countries of the  
Six-Nation Summit in New Delhi (Argentina 32, Greece 46, Mexico  
48, Sweden 5 and Tanzania 2) joined the resident foreign and  
Indian press corps in New Delhi to cover the Summit on Nuclear  
Disarmament in January 1985 and were given full facilities.  
Consequently, there was sizeable publicity for the Summit in  
India and abroad, highlighted by a live telecast of the  
proceedings and the joint press conference, in various capitals.  
A comprehensive pamphlet on the Summit was prepared and widely  
distributed abroad through our Missions. 
 
   <br><br>A large number of foreign and Indian media personnel who  
included 26 journalists/cameramen who had come from abroad (8  
from Yugoslavia, 3 from Pakistan, 3 from Nigeria and the rest  
from Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Doha) covered the  
Extra-ordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of  
the Non-aligned Countries on Namibia. For catering to their need  
of photo opportunities, supply of copies of transcript of  
speeches, fixing of interviews with dignitaries, etc. a media  
centre at Vigyan Bhavan appropriate for such a large conference  
was set up with the help of the Press Information Bureau. Apart  
from the daily briefings, special high level briefing was  
arranged on the eve of the meeting. A Pamphlet entitled "Non- 
aligned Movement 
<br>-67&gt; 
 
<br><br>during India's Chairmanship" and a press release entitled  
"Background on the Question of Namibia" were distributed by XP  
Division. Doordarshan was assisted by us in organising many  
special programmes relating to the NAM meeting and XP Division  
arranged for a daily round-up on Doordarshan. Doordarshan offered  
daily capsules over the satellite on the proceedings of the  
meeting which were picked up by a number of NAM countries. 
 
 <br><br>  The XP Division expanded its network of communications to keep  
our Missions informed on matters of contemporary interest in  
India, relations with other countries as well as on important  
political, economic, scientific, cultural and technological  
developments in India through twice daily transmissions. During  
the year, 15 more missions were added thus increasing the total  
number of missions/posts covered on a daily transmissions basis  
to 54. In addition, 34 missions are receiving bi-weekly press  
telexes, and 3 missions are covered by press cables. 
 
 <br><br>  The "Indian and Foreign Review," a fortnightly magazine, in  
colour, and its French counterpart, "Courrier de L'Inde," the  
monthly "Foreign Affairs Record" as well as the periodic  
compilations of the Prime Minister's speeches on foreign policy  
were separately brought out regularly. Pamphlets on Prime  
Minister's visits to USSR, USA, Egypt and Algeria were also  
brought out as were special publications on the Six-Nation Summit  
and 40th anniversary of the UN. 
 
 <br><br>  XP Division purchased "Hip Hip Hurray," "Sagar Sangam" and  
"Daigaya Mukalu" children's film-all feature films-and many  
documentary films which included "Everest 84," highlighting the  
achievements of Kumari Bacchendari Pal and the full set of the  
films produced by the Films Division on India's freedom struggle.  
Film Weeks were organised by our Missions in Tokyo, Seoul, Suva,  
Lisbon, the Hague, Antananarivo and Dhaka, with the help of XP  
Division. 
 
   <br><br>XP Division organised the visit abroad of two professors from  
the Film and Television Institute, Pune, and also supplied  
required film material for an Indian Film Seminar organised by  
our Mission at Dhaka. Video and audio cassettes of the India  
magazine programme covering topical developments and suitable  
entertainment programmes were supplied weekly to 63 missions.  
Video Cassette Recorders and Colour TVs were sanctioned to the  
Information Wings of 30 missions for monitoring coverage on  
India. Video material on achievements of Indian women was  
supplied for screening during the International Women's  
Conference in Nairobi in July 1985. Indira Priyadarshini Photo  
Exhibition was sent to our missions in Algiers and Cairo on the  
occasion of the Prime Minister's visit to these countries apart  
from the regular supply of photographs and transparencies to our  
missions abroad. Photos for Exhibitions on the occasion of the  
40th anniversary of the UN and the SAARC Pavillion at the Indian  
International Trade Fair, 1985, at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi  
were also provided. 
<br>-68&gt; 
 
  <br><br> The XP Division continued to provide facilities to media  
representatives from abroad for doing their work. During the  
nine-month period ending 31 December 1985, apart from catering to  
the resident foreign and Indian media representatives accredited  
to the Press Information Bureau, about 400 foreign media  
representatives who came on the occasion of important  
international conferences held in New Delhi or whenever  
theyaccompanied visiting Heads of State/Government were catered  
to. Similarly, complete logistic arrangements with the help of  
our missions abroad were made for the large media contingent  
which accompanied the Prime Minister on his visits to the Soviet  
Union, USA, UK, France, Oman, Vietnam, Japan, Bangladesh, New  
York and Nassau so that they could transmit their  
despatches/photographs and films speedily back to India for  
publication. Rules governing the entry of foreign television and  
film documentary teams have been considerably streamlined.  
Producers are no longer required to give an undertaking that  
their films will be released only after prior viewing by us, and  
the lead time for clearing applications has been reduced to three  
weeks from the previous 6-8 weeks. This liberalisation has had a  
beneficial effect in that it has removed some irritants. At the  
same time in administering these liberalised rules every care is  
being taken that there is no abuse of those rules. 
 
 <br><br>  The meeting of Sub-commission III on Information (including  
Social Sciences), Culture and Sports of the Indo-Pak Joint  
Commission was held in New Delhi during the period 2-4 July 1985.  
Consequent on the decisions taken, the "Times of India"  
correspondent has taken up his position in Pakistan and similarly  
a "Jung" correspondent from Pakistan has started functioning in  
India in addition to the PTI correspondent in Pakistan and the  
Associated Press of Pakistan's correspondent in India. All India  
Radio and Radio Pakistan are also exchanging correspondents. 
 
  <br><br> A three-member Indian delegation attended the first  
coordinating committee meeting of the Non-aligned News Agencies  
Pool (NANAP) at Belgrade. XP Division assisted the organisers of  
the Sixth General Assembly of the Asian Pacific News Agency held  
in New Delhi during the period 27-30 March 1985. 
 
  <br><br> The XP Division continued to subscribe to the feature news  
services of news agencies and commissioned special articles on  
the occasion of Republic and Independence Days for dissemination  
abroad. The publication of special supplements on India on  
National occasions were also facilitated.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br><br>A large number of persons of Indian origin have settled in  
many countries all over the world and Indian nationals are also  
travelling and residing abroad on an increasing scale. Over the  
years people of Indian origin have made a significant and wide- 
ranging contribution to the development of the countries of their  
residence and played a useful role in their political, economic  
and industrial development. Many developing countries have  
acknowledged the "Indian factor" in their socio-economic  
progress. In several industrialised countries Indian expatriates  
have acquired a special visibility because of their professional  
and technological skills. It is the consistent policy of the  
Government of India that persons of Indian origin who have taken  
the nationality of the countries of their domicile should  
identify themselves with the country of their adoption. The  
Government of India, however, continues to respond to their need  
to maintain cultural contacts with India and remains alive to  
their interests and welfare. it is also the duty and  
responsibility of the Government of India to protect the rights  
and interests of Indian citizens living abroad and take  
appropriate action in this regard whenever called upon to do so. 
 
  <br><br> Indian overseas, whether our nationals or not, expect a wide  
variety of services from the Government of India. Our Missions  
are frequently called upon to respond to queries or demands on a  
wide-range of subjects, The Special Coordination Division has  
been set up in the Ministry of External Affairs to handle the  
work relating to Indians Overseas, including Indian citizens.  
This Division is the nodal point to which references are made for  
coordinated action. The need for such a nodal point had also been  
increasingly felt by our Missions abroad and Indians overseas,  
specially when several economic and/or political questions are  
required to be tackled. Issus relating to Overseas Indians are  
being dealt with in a number of Ministries and agencies of  
Government of India. The Division keeps in close touch with these  
Ministries, agencies and is engaged in collecting  information on  
issues pertaining to Indians Overseas so that a central pool of  
information is built up. 
 
  <br><br> It is being increasingly appreciated that Indians Overseas can  
provide a bridge of understanding in the effort to strengthen  
friendly relations between India and the country of their  
domicile. They have demonstrated their potential as a reservoir  
of skill, expertise, technology and investment for the benefit  
both of the country of their adoption and the land of their  
origin. To this end, Indian Missions abroad have been encouraged  
to expand their cultural contacts with Overseas Indians generally  
with due regard to the needs of the host countries, in addition  
to the efforts that are being made by the Missions to render  
effective services to Indian nationals overseas.

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>As part of its continuing efforts to render better and faster  
service to the public, further streamlining of procedures,  
simplification of formalities and rationalisation of the  
organisational set-up has been undertaken. 
 
 <br><br>  There are 21 Passport Offices under the control of the  
Ministry of External Affairs. These  offices are spread all over  
India covering almost all the States. During the calendar year  
1985, these offices earned a revenue of Rs. 9.39 crores through  
passport fee and incurred an expenditure of Rs. 2.93 crores  
towards office establishment resulting in a net revenue of Rs.  
6.45 crores, to the Government. A detailed statement of revenue  
and expenditure is given at Appendix VI. A Statement showing the  
number of passports issued and miscellaneous services rendered  
during 1985 is at Appendix VII. 
 
  <br><br> Several administrative steps have been taken during the year  
to help the passport applicants through simplification of the  
application forms/procedures. The payment of the passport fee  
through postal order instead of money orders was introduced, as  
the postal orders are easily available in all denominations at  
all Post Offices in India and also because of its easy accounting  
procedure. To modernise the cash accounting in the Passport  
Offices, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) are being introduced.  
Four ECRs have already been installed at the Passport Office,  
Delhi. By the end of March 1986, ECRs will be installed at  
Bareilly, Trichy and Calcutta. It is intended to instal ECRs in  
the rest of the Passport Offices during the financial year 1986- 
87. 
 
  <br><br> A few legal measures have also been taken during the year to  
rectify the inadequacies in the existing arrangements. A  
notification under the Passport Act, 1967, has been issued to  
exempt from Passport application, the Indian nationals who are to  
be deported by the foreign governments but who do not hold valid  
travel documents and refuse to apply to the concerned Indian  
Missions forgrant of Emergency Certificate for travel to India. 
 
  <br><br> Further, the Passport Rules, 1980, have been liberalised by  
dispensing with the requirement of financial guarantee or in lieu  
there  of the verification certificate. The passport application  
form has also been simplified and made computer compatible. With  
these twin measurs it has become easier for the general public to  
avail of the passport facility. 
<br>-75&gt; 
 
  <br><br> With a view to closely monitor the implementation of policy  
aspects and also to have proper feed-back from the passport  
offices on the practical aspects of the implementation of  
procedures, the biennial Passport officers Conference was held  
inNew Delhi from 21-23 November 1985. The Conference was attended  
by Officers from the 21 Passport Offices, representatives from  
the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of  
Labour, Deptt. of Electronics etc., and the Security Printing  
Press, Nashik. Apart from a review of the work being done in the  
Passport Offices, the meeting also considered the planned  
computerisation and introduction of Machine Readable Passports.  
The biennial Conference has since been made an annual feature. 
 <br><br>
   In the financial year 1985-86 steps have been taken to instal  
computers at the four major Passport Offices, viz., Delhi,  
Bombay, Cochin and Madras. Of the remaining Passport Offices in  
the country, 12 offices shall be computerised during the  
financial year 1986-87. Computerisation of the Missions abroad  
shall also begin in 1986-87 to be largely completed by 1987-88.  
Computerisation of the Passport Offices and the Missions  
constitute the first step towards introduction of Machine  
Readable Passports. The Government has decided to introduce  
Machine Readable Passports by 1990-91 in phases. The Machine  
Readable Passports will enable the  Government to ensure  
tamperproof security of the booklets, provide better quality  
booklets to the passport applicants and will enable quicker  
clearance at the international airports. The Machine Readable  
Passports will be of the specifications prescribed by the  
International Civil Aviation Organisation and International  
Standard Organisation. 
 
  <br><br> An important step in handling complaints from the public was  
taken during the year by setting up of a Grievance Cell in all  
the Passport Offices. A comparatively senior officer in each  
Passport Office was designated to receive, enquire into and  
dispose of complaints from the public on delays in issuing  
passports. During the year 1985, approximately 1100 cases of  
complaints regarding delay in issue of fresh passports or renewal  
thereof were received in the Grievance Cell of the Ministry of  
External Affairs against the Passport Offices in India. All these  
complaints were referred to the concerned Passport Offices for  
immediate necessary action, and about 400 complaints were settled  
promptly by issuing passports and rendering the services desired  
by the applicants. Reports on the complaints received from the  
passport offices indicate that the reasons for delay were  
generally non-receipt or late receipts of verification reports  
and noncompliance of formalities by the applicants themselves.  
The applicants are generally kept informed of the reasons for  
delay. Renewal of passports or other miscellaneous services are  
generally being rendered in three working days. 
 
 <br><br>  Fifty nine cases of appeal against the orders of impounding or  
refusal of passport facilities to Indian nationals by the  
Passport Offices were received. In about 28 cases, the Chief  
Passport Officer himself heard the appeal and passed orders  
allowing or rejecting the appeals. Other cases of appeal are in  
the process of consideration. 
 <br><br>
   Two hundred and twenty applications were received for issue of  
Certificate of Identity to stateless persons, most of them being  
Tibetan refugees. In most of the cases, 5 EA/85-12. 
<br>-76&gt; 
 
<br>Certificates of Identity have been issued to the applicants.  
About 130 requests were received from Indian passport holders for  
grant of endorsements for South Africa. Almost all the cases have  
been disposed of on merits. 
 
  <br><br> During the year 1985, a total of 1487 cases of deportation of  
Indians came to the notice of the Ministry. Of this, as many as  
1295 were deported from UAE. The Indian Missions and Posts abroad  
repatriated 269 persons who found themselves stranded in foreign  
countries, after extending financial assistance wherever  
necessary. Cases of 238 Indian nationals arrested in various  
countries were received. The Missions have rendered all possible  
consular assistance to the arrested persons. Steps were also  
taken to facilitate their release and return to the country.  
Eight hundred thirty five cases of death of Indian nationals  
abroad came to the notice of the Ministry and action was  
initiated to claim wage-dues and death compensation, if any, for  
the legal heirs of the deceased, through the respective Indian  
Missions. The Ministry also handled 174 cases of deaths of  
foreign nationals in India. 
 
  <br><br> As part of the consular work, 1,32,981 documents submitted by  
the public for production to foreign authorities were attested  
during the year. The attestation service is being rendered free  
in India. Also, the attestation work is centralised and is done  
only in New Delhi (Attestation Cell, Patiala House). To  
decentralise the attestation facility, steps have been initiated  
to enact suitable legislation. 
 
  <br><br> The fee structure for consular services rendered abroad by our  
Missions has been further simplified by introducing a uniform fee  
for all Missions through a suitable amendment for the Diplomatic  
&amp; Consular Officer (Fees) Rules, 1949, and Foreign Marriage  
Rules, 1970. The two categories of rates applicable earlier have  
been merged into a single uniform schedule. Consular fee  
structure has been further simplified. 
 
 <br><br>  The need for streamlining the functioning of our consular  
sections abroad was emphasised at the highest level. The reports  
concerning the action taken received from our Missions were

<tr class="evenRow"><td><p align="justify"><br>During the year under review, the Ministry made constant  
efforts for the propagation of Hindi abroad and for the use of  
Hindi in official language policy of the Government of India and  
in pursuance of the Official Language Act and rules framed  
thereunder. At the Headquarters of the Ministry as well as in the  
Regional Passport Offices and in the Missions and Posts abroad,  
use of Hindi was further encouraged. In countries where there is  
a sizeable population of Indian origin, constant efforts were  
made for the propagation of Hindi. 
 
  <br><br> With a view to monitoring the progress of Hindi in the  
Ministry, meetings of the Official Language Implementation  
Committee were held and various measures for the proper  
implementation of the Official Language Rules and Act in the  
Ministry were discussed. Official Language Implementation  
Committees have also been constituted or are being constituted in  
bigger Passport Offices. Quarterly Progress Reports regarding  
progressive use of Hindi were called for and reviewed regularly  
from the various sections of the Ministry and Passport Offices  
and also from the Indian Missions abroad. 
 
   <br><br>During the year under review, one of the important decisions  
taken was to constitute the full fledged Hindi Advisory Committee  
in the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Foreign Minister in  
place of the sub-Committee of the Central Hindi Committee that  
has thus far been functioning in this Ministry. A resolution to  
this effect has been issued. The first meeting of the Committee  
is also being convened shortly. 
 
   <br><br>Officials posted in Indian Missions abroad make use of Hindi  
messages from the President on the occasion of Republic Day and  
Independence Day. 
 
  <br><br> The Ministry of External Affairs traditionally issued all the  
Letters of Appointment, Letters of Credence and Letters of  
Recall, etc., of Heads of Missions posted abroad originally in  
Hindi. 
 
  <br><br> During the year under review, the Ministry prepared the Hindi  
texts of Protocol/ Agreements entered into with the Foreign  
Governments. In addition, the Hindi Section 
<br>-80&gt; 
 
<br>of the Ministry vetted the Hindi texts of the Protocols and  
Agreements prepared by other Ministries. 
 
  <br><br> During the year, the Hindi Section has also taken in hand the  
translation of the literature of United Nations in pursuance of  
the decision taken earlier in the Meetings of the sub-Committee.
