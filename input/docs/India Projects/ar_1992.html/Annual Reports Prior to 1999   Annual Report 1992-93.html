<br>India's External Relations  An Overview
<br>
<br></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>The functioning of the Minis" of External Affairs during the year 
   1992-93 should be evaluated in the context of the additional dimensions 
   of changes and uncertainties which characterised international relations 
   during this period, as well as certain trends of domestic turmoil and 
   tension. India's foreign policy, therefore, had to acquire the necessary 
   flexibility and responsiveness to meet the situation. The year under 
   review shows that the Ministry under the guidance of the higher 
   leadership in the Government has been able to meet this objective to a 
   satisfactory extent despite external pressures and internal constraints. 
    
  <br><br>Basic considerations which governed the structuring of our foreign 
   policy and its implementation are: preservation of India's national 
   identity as a plural, democratic and secular society, India's 
   territorial integrity, and well-being of our people. This last objective 
   involved the refashioning of our domestic economic arrangements and its 
   appropriate projection abroad so that the necessary external inputs 
   could be ensured for sustaining developmental activities and 
   modernisation of our economy. These factors governing our foreign policy 
   were subject to pressures generated by external trends and forces 
   characterising the international situation. While there were growing 
   trends of democracy in the international community and a greater demand 
   for economic fairplay and respect for human rights, there was also an 
   upsurge of centrifugal ethno-religious forces, secessionist movements, 
   assertion of subnational identities threatening composite pluralistic 
   societies. Our foreign policy had to and has to cope with these 
   challenges while ensuring our abiding interests in maintaining our 
   national identity and ensuring our economic development. 
    
 <br><br>  India adjusted to the rapidly changing external scenario with dynamism 
   and a practical approach. Though in the aftermath of the cold war the 
   world 
    
    
   was perceived as unipolar with the United States becoming the most 
   influential politico-military power, India perceived that the 
   international situation cannot be defined in uni-dimensional terms. 
   There were and there are other emerging centres of influence which would 
   have long term influence on and implications for international 
   relations. An economically resurgent China, - technologically and 
   economically dominant Japan and Germany, a politically assertive Europe 
   integrating itself in socio-economic terms were and are to be 
   acknowledged as potent influences in the conduct of 'foreign relations. 
   The emergence of regional cooperation arrangements in the ASEAN and Asia 
   Pacific region and in South and North America were other factors to be 
   reckoned with. The emerging world, therefore, is multipolar and Indian 
   foreign policy aimed at establishing equations with these emerging 
   centres of influence in international relations. The balance held by the 
   two superpowers is gone. The multiplicity of new nations and the role of 
   Russia in the changed context requires bilateral exchanges and the 
   forging of new associations with emerging nations. 
   <br>-1&gt; 
   <br><br>India's relations with its immediate neighbours in South Asia are 
   naturally a matter of highest priority. India made a conscious and 
   purposive effort to improve bilateral relations and multilateral 
   cooperation with its neighbours. Prime Minister, Shri Narasimha Rao, met 
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan five times at different 
   international conferences. Foreign Secretary level talks were held as 
   scheduled throughout the period under review. Additional Confidence 
   Building Measures are being put in place gradually. Attempts continued 
   for establishing a working good-neighbourly relationship with Pakistan. 
   In overall terms, however, there has been a distinct negative trend in 
   Pakistan's attitude towards improving Indo-Pak relations. Unless there 
   is a change in Pakistan's behaviour, an adversarial and tense 
   interaction could be the prospect in the foreseeable future. The reason, 
   in India's perception, is Pakistan's continuing domestic political 
   compulsions to interfere in Kashmir and Punjab, Pakistan's perceptions 
   about India's vulnerabilities of which it attempts to take advantage and 
   Pakistan's own internal crisis of identity which necessitates the power 
   structure of Pakistan nurturing an antagonistic relationship with India 
   on the basis of communal and extremist religious arguments. While 
   acknowledging these prospects realistically, India's endeavour remains 
   to prevent the tense relationship 
    
    
   from crossing thresholds which could drift towards military 
   confrontation. India's long term interest is in having a good- 
   neighbourly and normal relationship with Pakistan. 
   <br>-2&gt;
  <br><br> Relations with Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives have steadily 
   improved and the content of bilateral relations has increased. There is 
   a qualitative and positive change in our relations with Nepal, which 
   acquired economic substance due to the discussions held between the 
   Prime Minister of Nepal and Prime Minister, Shri Narasimha Rao, at Delhi 
   and Kathmandu. Our commitment to deepening our close links with Bhutan 
   was expressed through decisions on cooperation in Bhutan's Seventh Five 
   Year Plan (1992-97) and during the King of Bhutan's State visit to India 
   in January 1993. With Nepal, an ambitious agenda of cooperation in 
   developing water resources and in strengthening our many bonds was 
   agreed during Prime Minister Shri Narasimha Rao's visit to Nepal in 
   October 1992. Discussions held by our Prime Minister Shri Rao with 
   President Premadasa in Colombo in late 1991 and during Mr Premadasa's 
   visit to India in January 1993 marked a constructive orientation in 
   relations with Sri Lanka. There have been high level visits between 
   these countries and India which contributed substantially to this 
   process. Discussions between Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and President 
   Gayoom also structured bilateral relations between India and Maldives on 
   positive lines. 
    
  <br><br> Relations with Bangladesh showed improvement, the highlight of the year 
   was Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia's visit to India in May, 1992. The 
   long standing problem related to the Tin Bigha corridor was resolved 
   with India handing over Tin Bigha to Bangladesh and satisfactory 
   arrangements being made for Bangladesh's access to the Tin Bigha area 
   through a leased corridor. Issues relating to the sharing of water 
   resources, the return of the Chakma refugees were the subject matter of 
   detailed discussions. Though they remain unresolved, a willingness to 
   reason together on these issues instead of taking rigid political 
   stances characterised exchanges between the two countries. 
    
  <br><br> The demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya and its aftermath 
   has affected bilateral relations with India on the one hand and Pakistan 
   and Bangladesh on the other. The assertively intrusive pronouncements 
   made 
    
    
   by the leaders of these two countries and the resolutions passed in the 
   National Legislatures of these two countries on developments in India 
   have certainly generated additional tensions. Establishing a pattern of 
   durable friendly relations and creating an atmosphere of peace and 
   stability in the South Asian region, therefore, remains a difficult task 
   but working for the objectives of friendship, peace and stability with 
   patience remains a commitment of the Government of India not only 
   because this is desirable but also because it is necessary and 
   imperative for stability and progress of the South Asian region. 
   <br>-3&gt;
   <br><br>India's relations with the United States have become closer and more 
   substantial. Beginning with the meeting between Prime Minister Narasimha 
   Rao and President George Bush in New York in January 1992 during the 
   Security Council Summit, a series of high level contacts continued 
   throughout the period under review. These contacts covered political, 
   strategic, economic and cultural activities in consequence of which 
   Indo-US cooperation in these spheres have increased in range and 
   content. 
    
   <br><br>India has restructured its relations with all the countries which 
   constituted the former Soviet Union. High level exchanges took place 
   between India and the Russian Federation culminating in President 
   Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993 during which ten bilateral 
   agreements for cooperation were signed covering the entire spectrum of 
   political, economic, technological and defence relations. The visit, 
   while underlining the continuity in IndoRussian relations, also 
   signified India establishing a new pattern of relations with the Russian 
   Federation, the latter emphasising that the relationship is with a new 
   political entity and not merely a continuum from the relationship with 
   the former Soviet Union. 
    
   <br><br>The year was characterised by exchange of visits between the top 
   political leaders of various Republics which constituted the former 
   Soviet Union. A series of bilateral agreements of cooperation in 
   different fields have been put in place with several of these Republics. 
   India has established direct diplomatic relations with all the Central 
   Asian Republics and European Republics which formerly were in the Soviet 
   Union. Foundations have been laid for long term and substantive 
   relations with all these Republics keeping in mind mutual requirements 
   and complimentarities. Conscious of the special 
    
    
   cultural and historical linkages with the Central Asian region, India 
   has opened Embassies in Alma Ata in Kazhakhstan and Tashkent in 
   Uzbekistan. The Ministry has also decided to open a Mission in Dushanbe 
   in Tajikistan. These Missions have concurrent accreditations to cover 
   other countries in Central Asia. The majority of leaders, who came to 
   India from areas formerly of the Soviet Union, were from the Central 
   Asian Republics and a number of leaders of the Government of India also 
   visited these Republics. 
  <br>-4&gt; 
  <br><br> The politico-economic integration of Europe despite the difficulties 
   being encountered in the process required India to incorporate the 
   factor in its relationship with West European countries. High level 
   contacts were maintained with these countries with Prime Ministerial 
   level exchanges having taken place with UK, Germany, France, Portugal 
   and Spain. Both political and economic relations were strengthened and 
   their long term orientation are being defined in agreements with the 
   European Community collectively and with several European countries 
   individually. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with China showed steady improvement and were 
   characterised by an increasing number of high level visits and 
   discussions. Prime Minister Li Peng visited India during the period 
   under review; former President R Venkataraman visited China and had 
   extensive discussions with the entire leadership of China. Apart from 
   these, Legislators, Ministers, cultural and technological delegations 
   exchanged visits. Consulates were reopened in Shanghai and Bombay. The 
   Joint Working Group dealing with 
   the boundary question increased the ' frequency of its meetings and 
   tangible progress has been made in implementing mutual confidence 
   building measures and towards reaching an agreement on maintaining peace 
   and tranquillity on the Line of Actual Control. While the resolution of 
   the boundary question will take time, the objective of both sides has 
   been to steadily strengthen bilateral relations and evolving a political 
   atmosphere of mutual trust which would contribute to the solution of the 
   boundary issue. Instead of the annual one round of the bilateral 
   meetings of the Joint Working Group, two rounds (fourth and fifth) of 
   the JWG have already been held during the year and the next round 
   (sixth) will take place during 1993. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to Japan in June 1992 and the visit 
   of Prince and Princess Akishino from Japan to India in November 1992, 
    
    
   commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
   relations between India and Japan were the highlights of Indo-japanese 
   relations during 1992-93. Indo-japanese political, cultural, economic 
   and technological cooperation showed growth. High level exchanges 
   between Governmental and economic leaders of the two countries gave an 
   impetus to this process. These exchanges with Japan reflected the 
   importance that India attaches to Indo-japanese relations in the context 
   of Japan's significance and influence in regional and international 
   affairs. 
  <br>-5&gt; 
  <br><br> Success of the ASEAN as a regional grouping of countries naturally 
   attracted India's attention, given India's own economic reforms. India 
   desired improved relations with individual countries in the ASEAN region 
   and with ASEAN as a collective entity. ASEAN agreed to have sectoral 
   dialogue with India and associated India with the ASEAN in a sectoral 
   framework. This implies India's being able to interact with the ASEAN 
   countries in specific areas of economic and technological activities. 
   Bilateral relations with important ASEAN countries have also increased 
   with possibilities of greater economic interaction between them and 
   India. Beginnings have also been made for cooperation in the fields of 
   defence supplies and consultations on security matters with the 
   initiation of high level visits by our Defence Minister and senior 
   officials of the Ministry and Service Chiefs to the area. 
    
   <br><br>India has shown interest in associating itself with new economic 
   cooperation arrangements which are on the anvil in the Asia Pacific 
   region including countries like Australia, South Korea and Japan. But as 
   these arrangements are still embryonic, final scope for further 
   cooperation with this area is yet to crystallise into future groupings. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with countries of the Gulf, West Asia and North Africa 
   were maintained on an even keel. An important development was that the 
   misunderstandings about India's policies in some countries towards the 
   Gulf crisis of 1990-91 were removed. Relations were stabilised and 
   upgraded. India's economic relations and the status and well-being of 
   the people of Indian origin functioning in the Gulf countries, West Asia 
   and North Africa stabilised and improved. 
    
   <br><br>India's establishing direct diplomatic relations with Israel was in 
   conformity with the emerging trend in international relations of more 
   and more countries 
    
    
   including Arab countries having contacts with Israel. The Chairman of 
   the PLO Mr Yasser Arafat also acknowledged the political realism of the 
   step taken by India. India was invited to become a participant in the 
   Middle East Peace Process and was invited to become a member of all the 
   five working groups discussing different aspects of structuring new 
   agreements on the Middle East-Palestine question. India has been a 
   participant in these proceedings since their inception. 
  <br>-6&gt; 
   <br><br>Developments in South Africa, particularly the ongoing discussions 
   between the African National Congress and the regime in Pretoria were a 
   matter Of particular interest and attention to India. India has sent 
   observers to monitor proceedings and discussions for the restoration of 
   democracy and a majority government in South Africa. Indian political 
   figures and officials have been in close touch with the Commonwealth 
   Secretariat and with the African National Congress in furthering the 
   process for the installation of a truly democratic Government in South 
   Africa. Expectation is that such a Government will come into being by 
   the end of 1993. India proposes to gradually increase its cultural, 
   commercial and consular presence in South Africa in tandem with progress 
   being made towards the installation of a democratic Government in that 
   country. India expects to establish full diplomatic relations when a 
   democratic Government comes into power in South Africa. 
    
   <br><br>India maintained its close relationship with African countries and with 
   their leaders. Programmes of economic and technical cooperation have 
   been sustained. However, due to political violence, uncertainties and 
   considerations of economy, the Ministry decided to close down its 
   Missions in Zaire, Somalia and Malawi. 
    
   <br><br>India's bilateral relations with countries of Caribbean and South 
   America were maintained at optimum levels despite limitations of 
   distance and economic factors. India's cooperation with South American 
   countries were particularly significant in the multilateral context as 
   during the period under report the Global Summit Conference on 
   Environment and the various meetings of the G-15 were held in that 
   region. 
    
  <br><br> India was active in various multilateral fora sharing the concern of the 
   international community on important issues and also for ensuring its 
   own 
    
    
   national interests which can be affected by the deliberations and 
   decisions of such organisations. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao 
   participated in the Security Council Summit at the end of January 1992. 
   He also participated in the International Economic Conference at Davos 
   and the Non-Aligned Summit at Jakarta. India remained active in the 
   United Nations particularly as a member of the Security Council till the 
   end of 1992, relinquishing the seat on the 1st of January 1993, at the 
   end of India's two-year tenure. Indian forces are participating in UN 
   peace keeping operations in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Cambodia and 
   Mozambique. 
  <br>-7&gt; 
   <br><br>The Indian delegation led by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao took part in 
   the crucial 10th Non-Aligned Summit held in Jakarta in September 1992. 
   This Summit was crucial because it was the first Summit of the NAM after 
   the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the end of the cold war, and the 
   emergence of new equations between different power centres in the world. 
   The relevance of the NAM and countries in the non-aligned movement was 
   being questioned. Prime Minister Shri Narasimha Rao's speech gave the 
   necessary orientation to the NAM emphasising that if the NAM was 
   relevant in a bipolar world, it is even more relevant as a movement to 
   protect the interests of the developing countries in a unipolar or 
   economically multipolar world. Our Prime Minister's realistic and 
   practical analysis of the prospect and role of the NAM was appreciated 
   and was acknowledged as an important factor contributing to the movement 
   adjusting to changing realities with the required orientations and 
   directions. 
    
   <br><br></td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td>Activities of the G-15 continued to be a matter of attention on the part 
   of India. India participated in the preparatory meetings for the G-15 in 
   Caracas, New York, Geneva and Dakar, ultimately leading to the 
   participation of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the G-15 Summit in 
   Dakar in November 1992. India alongwith Senegal and Malaysia contributed 
   substantially to the programmes and projects being undertaken by the G- 
   15. India is to host the next summit of the G-15 in Delhi later in 1993. 
    
   <br><br>India remains fully committed to the ideals and objectives of the SAARC 
   Charter. Indian participation was active and sustained in various 
   programmes, projects and workshops organised by SAARC. India took a 
   particularly positive attitude on various new suggestions and projects 
   for 
   
    
   regional cooperation brought up with the SAARC during the period under 
   review. India was supportive in finalising recommendations for poverty 
   alleviation programme and for the establishment of a SAARC preferential 
   trade area. It was India's expectation that high level policy decisions 
   would be finalised during the SAARC Summit to be held in Dhaka in 
   December and later in January. Unfortunately this Summit could not take 
   place because of the political tensions and violence occurring in 
   Bangladesh and Pakistan and the views expressed on bilateral and 
   regional cooperation by leading governmental and political circles in 
   these two countries which gave negative signals to a meaningful 
   dialogue. The Government of India felt that holding of the Summit in a 
   surcharged and tense atmosphere would be counterproductive. India hopes 
   that an atmosphere of calm and peace would be restored so that the SAARC 
   Summit could be held. India's request for a postponement of the 
   scheduled Summit in no way erodes India's abiding commitments to 
   cooperation with its South Asian neighbours within the framework of the 
   SAARC. This last message was specially conveyed by the Prime Minister of 
   India to the Heads of Governments of member countries of SAARC. 
   <br>-8&gt; 
  <br><br> In the deliberations at the LIN during the period covered by this 
   report, India strongly advocated the democratisation of the LIN and for 
   making the Security Council and other organs of the LIN more 
   representative of the increased membership of the UN. While welcoming 
   the increasingly effective role that the UN is playing in peace keeping 
   and peace building operations, India urged that decisions regarding UN 
   initiatives in these matters should always be based on a consensus in 
   the General Assembly that such action should reflect the will of the 
   international community rather than just five permanent members of the 
   Security Council and that such activity should always be strictly within 
   the framework of the UN Char-ter and carried out under the command of 
   the LIN. India also noted that the five permanent members of the 
   Security Council are not in favour of revising the Charter or expanding 
   the Security Council though there have been suggestions that Germany and 
   Japan could be given permanent seats. India would continue its advocacy 
   for the democratisation of the UN to make it more effective. 
    
   <br><br>Issues of international concerns like human rights, environment, non- 
   proliferation and the transfer of advanced technologies in their foreign 
    
    
   policy dimensions engaged the attention of the Ministry. India has 
   consistently maintained that while it is committed to universal norms of 
   human rights, these should not be used unilaterally as an argument to 
   pressurise developing countries. On non-proliferation, India remains 
   committed to a principled stand, viz India is completely committed to 
   nonproliferation. However, India will not be party to any discriminatory 
   arrangement regarding non-proliferation as envisaged in the NPT. India 
   is willing to work bilaterally and multilaterally to achieve the 
   objective of global and complete disarmament, particularly nuclear 
   disarmament within a definite timeframe on a non-discriminatory basis. 
   India has agreed to have bilateral discussions with a number of 
   important countries to meet this objective. That these countries which 
   are committed to non-proliferation treaty are agreeable to have 
   bilateral discussions with India indicates that in some measure they 
   accept the logic and relevance of the Indian stand on non-proliferation 
   though they may not completely agree with our approach. The NPT is 
   coming up for renewal in 1995 preparatory work for this commencing later 
   in 1993. India is of the view that this occasion should be utilised to 
   review the contents of the NPT to make it non-discriminatory and 
   universally applicable. 
  <br>-9&gt; 
  <br><br>India participated in the Global Summit on Environment in Rio de Janeiro 
   in June 1992 at the Prime Minister's level. India's advocacy in favour 
   of protecting global environment without juxtaposing this objective with 
   the need for sustained development found a responsive echo among many of 
   the participants. 
    
   <br><br>India has voiced opposition to restrictive or discriminatory regimes 
   being put in place against the transfer of modern and sophisticated 
   technologies from the advanced to the developing countries. These 
   technologies relate to space, generation of nuclear energy, 
   communications, informatics and so on. India is hoping to work with 
   like-minded countries in ensuring the formulation and implementation of 
   international rules and procedures in this regard in a fair and just 
   manner. 
    
   <br><br>In step with our liberalised economic policies and the growing 
   importance of increasing trade, investment and technology flows, the 
   Ministry worked through its Missions and Posts to promote and safeguard 
   India's economic 
    
    
   and commercial interests. It paid special attention to the requirement 
   of external economic publicity in the context of the need to effectively 
   project India and its economic reform programme to the international 
   business community. In addition to preparing state of the art 
   promotional material for use by its Missions abroad, the Ministry 
   successfully organised several investment promotion events in target 
   countries in coordination with concerned Ministries and with the 
   participation of their senior Ministers and officials. For visiting 
   delegations of top rank industrialists such as those that accompanied 
   the British Prime Minister in January and the German Chancellor in 
   February 1993, the Ministry organised high level panel discussions 
   between the visiting industrialists and several Secretaries to key 
   Ministries of Government of India such as Finance, Commerce, Industry, 
   Power and Telecommunications. These Roundtables were widely appreciated 
   both by the foreign Governments and businessmen concerned as having 
   provided the opportunity for useful interactions with GOI on investment 
   and trade related issues. In addition, the Ministry was active in 
   keeping Missions informed on an immediate basis on the changes in 
   economic policies and in obtaining regular feedback on reactions to 
   India's economic liberalisation programme among industrialised 
   countries. On the basis of this feedback, the Ministry sent periodic 
   reports to concerned Ministries and organisations on ongoing investment 
   promotion efforts and further measures that needed to be taken on 
   increasing inflows of foreign investment. It also organised economic 
   orientation programmes for its Heads of Missions from target countries; 
   these programmes served to underline the growing importance of the 
   economic aspects of Indian diplomacy and by promoting first hand 
   interactions with key economic Ministries, assisted the Missions in the 
   efficient discharge of their economic and commercial responsibilities. 
   <br>-10&gt; 
   <br><br>The Missions, especially in economically important countries, were 
   active in reaching out to foreign business communities and Governments 
   and keeping them informed of the new business opportunities available in 
   India. Investment promotion seminars and industrial delegations were 
   organised, business queries promptly responded to in coordination with 
   concerned Ministries and methodical follow-up undertaken thereafter to 
   maintain close contact with potential foreign investors. 
    
  <br><br> In recognition of the important role being played by it in India's 
   investment 
    
    
   and trade promotion efforts, the Ministry has been asked to participate 
   on the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the Steering Committee Of 
   Secretaries on economic reforms. 
  <br>-11&gt; 
  <br><br> The period under review was also characterised by certain internal steps 
   taken within the Ministry to improve its functioning and efficiency. 
    
  <br><br> New Embassies were set up in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Israel and 
   Consulates General in Shanghai, St. Petersberg and Vladivostok. In 
   addition, the Consulate in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, has been 
   upgraded to an Embassy. The personnel requirement of those new Missions 
   was met in the short run by swift diversion from other Missions. 
    
  <br><br> In accordance with the Government's directive on strict economy, certain 
   Missions were identified for closure after weighing all relevant 
   factors. The Missions slated for closure are those in Malawi, Zaire and 
   Colombia. Ministry is taking measures to ensure that our bilateral 
   relations with these countries are not affected by the closure of these 
   resident Missions. 
    
   <br><br>There has been a major reorganisation and streamlining of the work at 
   Headquarters so that the Ministry can respond more effectively to the 
   changed and changing international situation. Some territorial divisions 
   have been merged to ensure better coordination of policies in the 
   concerned area and some new Divisions have been created to enable the 
   Ministry to focus more closely on developments within those regions. To 
   handle work of specialised nature, separate Units have been, set up 
   where required. For example, a Central Asia Division was established to 
   look after the newly created CIS states in Asia; separate Asia Pacific 
   and ASEAN Divisions have been carved out, an International Security and 
   Disarmament Division has been set up to look after this specialised 
   work. Further, wherever economy as well as rationalisation could be 
   achieved through merger of Divisions, this exercise was undertaken. For 
   example, the Conference Cell was made a part of Protocol Division; SAARC 
   Division was merged with Economic Division. 
    
   <br><br>To optimise the utilisation of manpower, a time schedule has been drawn 
   up for regular meetings of the various Boards to recommend postings and 
   transfers of officials which is being strictly observed. As a result it 
   has become possible to plan the movement of personnel well ahead of time 
   resulting in greater efficiency. 
  <br> -12&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The Departmental Promotion Committees to consider promotions to various 
   grades in IFS as well as IFS (B) are being convened more regularly. This 
   contributed to service morale. 
    
   <br><br>Greater transparency has been introduced in the posting procedure. For 
   the first time, a system has been introduced for circulating information 
   well in advance about the posts available at all levels to the concerned 
   officers at Headquarters and abroad. 
    
   <br><br>During the year under report, four important construction projects at 
   New York, Kuwait, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur were completed. These buildings 
   are symbolic of our cultural heritage and reflect the image of a modern 
   and dynamic India. As a result of these efforts, Ministry will save 
   considerable expenditure on the rentals of offices and residences of 
   officials in these expensive cities. With the same objective in view, 
   the Ministry purchased five apartments for residences of the officials 
   of the Indian Embassy, Washington. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry also began several new projects for construction of 
   Chanceries and residences for officials at Beijing, Islamabad (Phase 
   II), Tashkent and a well equipped Campus for the Foreign Service 
   Institute at New Delhi. A modern and spacious office is being built up 
   for Regional Passport Office, New Delhi with improved facilities for the 
   public. 
    
   <br><br>The Indian Council for Cultural Relations continued its activities 
   imaginatively and effectively under the guidance of then Vice President 
   of India, Dr Shanker Dayal Sharma. Apart from organising cultural 
   festivals, the ICCR significantly diversified its activities to 
   encourage academic exchanges, research projects and publication of 
   material of contemporary socio-cultural importance. 
    
   <br><br>Publicity activities of the Ministry of External Affairs assumed 
   critical importance in face of the adverse publicity and propaganda 
   generated by some countries against India on issues of Kashmir, Punjab, 
   violation of human rights, etc. The reports and assessments on human 
   rights issues in India circulated by human rights organisations like 
   Amnesty International and Asia Watch also necessitated a gearing up of 
   Government of India's external publicity efforts to put matters in 
   perspective, to set the record 
    
    
   straight and, more important, to project the problems faced by India and 
   the remedial action being taken by India in a manner which would prevent 
   adverse fallout. India's external publicity efforts covered the entire 
   spectrum of media activities, audio-visual, personal interaction with 
   Press representatives, organisation of seminars and discussions with 
   participation from abroad, the commissioning of articles, monographs and 
   dissemination of substantive as well as descriptive information on 
   matters of interest and matters deserving attention. 
   <br>-13&gt; 
   <br><br>The Ministry initiated an exercise to review the entire system of 
   passport services with the objective of streamlining procedures in order 
   to reduce delays, improve infrastructure and provide the public with 
   prompt passport services, while simultaneously deterring passport fraud. 
    
   <br><br>As part of this exercise the Ministry introduced a number of measures 
   including the sale of forms through Post Offices, issuance of passports 
   on a first-come-first-served basis with a set time-limit for the police 
   verification report, decentralisation of powers for the priority issue 
   of passports to specified categories of applicants, streamlined 
   procedures for the issue of duplicate passports and availability of most 
   miscellaneous services at any Passport Office. On the operational front, 
   the Ministry concentrated on improving productivity. As a result, in 
   1992 there was a 40% increase in the output of fresh passports over the 
   previous year. 
    
   <br><br>1992 has been an eventful year for international relations. There were 
   historic at times cataclysmic, changes in the international geo- 
   political environment. Indian Foreign Policy had to respond not only to 
   these external changes but also to the winds of change sweeping the 
   internal economy. Thus, internal measures and requirements of austerity 
   had to be balanced against the need of meeting our national interests in 
   terms of external relations effectively. The performance of the Ministry 
   during 1992-93 has to be evaluated against this complex and challenging 
   backdrop.

<tr><td>INDIA CONTINUED TO PURSUE THE GOALS OF PEACE, FRIENDSHIP AND <br><br>
   COOPERATION in relations with her neighbours in South Asia. To achieve 
   these goals India, Inter alia, maintained high level contacts with the 
   countries of the region. 
    
   <br><br>During the year under review, traditionally close and cordial relations 
   between India and Nepal were further deepened and strengthened including 
   through exchange of a number of official visits. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister paid an official goodwill visit to Nepal from 19 to 21 
   October 1992 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Nepal. Prime 
   Minister was accompanied by Minister of State for External Affairs Shri 
   R L Bhatia and senior officials of the Government of India. The Indian 
   and Nepalese delegations led by the two Prime Ministers held detailed 
   discussions on issues of common interest. During the course of these 
   meetings, as also the earlier discussions at the official level that 
   preceded the visit of Prime Minister, a number of decisions were taken 
   and steps finalised with a view to further strengthening and expanding 
   bilateral cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>A Joint Communique was signed during the visit enlisting various areas 
   of cooperation between the two countries. In the trade sector in 
   particular, substantial improvements have been made and transit of 
   Nepalese goods has been further facilitated. India has agreed to enhance 
   the revolving stand-by credit facility extended to Nepal from the level 
   of Indian Rs 35 crores to Rs 50 crores. A timeframe for investigations, 
   preparation of project reports and other works for water resources 
   cooperation on the Karnali-Pancheshwar, Rapti Koshi, Budhi Gandaki, 
   Kamala and Bagmati projects were agreed upon. The B P Koirala Nepal- 
   India Foundation was jointly inaugurated by the two Prime Ministers 
   during the visit. The Foundation would provide an institutional 
   framework for promoting academic, cultural and technical exchanges 
   between India and Nepal. An Indo-Nepal high level task force has been 
   set up to monitor and review the implementation of Indian aided projects 
   in Nepal. The King of Nepal has accepted an invitation from Prime 
   Minister to visit India at a mutually convenient date. The Prime 
   Minister of Nepal has also accepted the invitation to visit India. 
  <br> -15&gt; 
    
   <br><br>A 6-member Parliamentary delegation led by Shri Shivraj Patil, Speaker 
   of Lok Sabha, visited Nepal from 15 to 19 November 1992 to participate 
   in the SAARC Speakers' Conference. Shri Patil extended an invitation to 
   Members of Parliament from Nepal to attend training camps organized by 
   India's Bureau of Parliamentary Studies. 
    
   <br><br>The traditionally close and friendly relations between India and Bhutan 
   were further strengthened. His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck visited 
   India in January 1993 and held discussions with President, Prime 
   Minister 'and other senior Ministers of the Government of India on 
   issues of mutual interest. There were other high-level visits also from 
   Bhutan including the visit of the Bhutanese Planning Minister, Minister 
   for Trade and Industry and Finance Minister. The Foreign Secretary and 
   Secretary (Water Resources) also visited Bhutan. These visits helped in 
   further consolidating the close relations between India and Bhutan. 
    
   <br><br>India's bilateral cooperation with Bhutan has been steadily increasing 
   right from 1961, when India fully funded Bhutan's First Five Year Plan. 
   This close economic cooperation has been further intensified during 
   Bhutan's Seventh Five Year Plan (1992-97) which was launched in July 
   1992. The total Indian assistance for Bhutan's Seventh Plan would be Rs 
   750 crores. Several major projects are expected to be taken up by India 
   in Bhutan during this plan period including a large cement plant at 
   Nganglam, an Airport Terminal building at Paro, Kurichu Hydel Project in 
   Eastern Bhutan, hospitals, roads and bridges, transmission lines and 
   sub-stations, etc. 
    
   <br><br>The long association of India in the development of Bhutan's power 
   sector was further strengthened in November 1992 with the signing of a 
   Memorandum of Understanding between India and Bhutan for taking up the 
   detailed project report for Bunakha Hydel Project in Bhutan. Bunakha 
   Hydel Project would have an installed capacity of 120 MW and would 
   contribute to the welfare and economic development of Bhutan. 
    
   <br><br>India continued to offer Bhutanese students opportunity for secondary as 
   well as higher education and training in various fields. Cooperation in 
   educational and cultural fields continued to be close. 
    
   <br><br>The year 1992 began with a positive note in the Indo-Bangladesh 
   relations with both Governments focussing attention on devising 
   modalities for leasing Tin Bigha Corridor. An understanding on this 
   question in March 1992 paved the way for the visit of Begum Khaleda Zia, 
   Prime Minister of Bangladesh, to India in May. The level of interaction 
   with the democratic 
    
    
   government in Dhaka continued to remain relatively high, despite 
   differences of opinion on some important bilateral issues. 
  <br>-16&gt; 
<br><br>The visit of democratically elected Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Begum 
   Khaleda Zia, to India from 26 to 28 May 1992 was the first State visit 
   to a SAARC country since her assumption of power in 1991. During the 
   visit, fruitful discussions took place on regional and several key 
   bilateral issues. In addition, the following three accords were signed: 
    
   <br><br>(a) Memorandum of Understanding on Exchange of Plots for the 
   Construction of Chancery and Residential building; 
    
   <br><br>(b) A Cultural and Academic Exchange Agreement; 
    
   <br><br>(c) Exchange of Instruments of Ratification for the Agreement on the 
   Avoidance of Double Taxation. 
    
   <br><br>Less than a month later, the Tin Bigha issue was satisfactorily 
   resolved. The Corridor was finally leased to Bangladesh and opened for 
   use by Bangladeshi passengers and vehicular traffic on 26 June. 
    
   <br><br>The goodwill thus generated was further enhanced by the subsequent 
   visits to Delhi by Bangladesh Ministers for Finance from 1 to 3 
   September and Foreign Affairs from 12 to 14 November, and the visits to 
   Dhaka by Minister for Water Resources from 25 to 27 August and Foreign 
   Secretary from 21 to 23 August. 
    
   <br><br>Unfortunately, after September there were some setbacks following the 
   controversy with regard to the steps to push back illegal Bangladeshi 
   migrants and the resistance by Bangladesh not to accept them. 
    
<br><br>Bilateral relations came under further strains due to violent reactions 
   in Bangladesh to the Ayodhya incident. In widespread violence, the 
   Indian diplomatic premises in Dhaka came under attack; the High 
   Commission Library and the Indian Airlines office were set on fire. 
   Scores of places of worship, commercial establishments and houses of the 
   minority community in Bangladesh were damaged and burnt. India expressed 
   her concern in this regard to the Government of Bangladesh as also the 
   hope that the countries of South Asia would join together in opposing 
   communal forces and would not allow these forces to retard the process 
   of bilateral and regional cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>Despite setbacks, India and Bangladesh continued to hold discussions to 
    
    
   resolve other outstanding bilateral matters such as the equitable 
   sharing of the waters of the major rivers and the repatriation of Chakma 
   refugees to Bangladesh. 
   <br>-17&gt;
   The first Secretary-level Joint Committee of Experts (JCE) met in New 
   Delhi on 19 and 20 November to devise a long-term settlement including 
   an interim arrangement of the flows of Ganga and Tista during the dry 
   season. So far as the repatriation of Chakma refugees is concerned, a 
   Political Level Committee was set up by the Government of Bangladesh in 
   July as stipulated in the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Communique of May 1992 
   to encourage Chakma refugees to return to Bangladesh and for finding out 
   a political solution to the Chakma problem. Negotiations were underway 
   between the Committee and the Chakma representatives. 
    
   <br><br>The trade review talks were held in New Delhi in August to place a 
   special focus on increasing and diversifying trade and economic 
   cooperation between India and Bangladesh. 
    
   <br><br>India's exports to Bangladesh in 1991-92 were valued at Rs 810 crores 
   whereas imports from Bangladesh were Rs 14 crores. 
    
   <br><br>Despite some tentative steps taken by the Myanmar Government recently 
   towards addressing the issue, Myanmar's suppression of the democratic 
   movement continued to be a factor in India's relations with that 
   country. India continued to press for the early restoration of democracy 
   in Myanmar. In early December 1992 India extended support to a UN 
   Resolution on Myanmar, calling for an early restoration of democracy and 
   human rights and the immediate and unconditional release of all 
   political prisoners including Ms Aung San Suu Kyi. 
    
   <br><br>India watched with close attention the changes introduced by Gen Than 
   Shwe, the Chairman of the state law and order restoration council, 
   including the decision to convene a National Convention on 9 January 
   1993 to formulate a new Constitution for Myanmar. 
    
   <br><br>With a view to a better management of a working relationship with the 
   Myanmar Government, India received a Myanmar delegation led by the 
   Director General of the Myanmar Foreign Office in August 1992. 
   Discussions held during the visit identified concrete areas for 
   bilateral cooperation including border trade, prevention of narco- 
   trafficking and contacts between the civilian and military authorities 
   in the border regions of the two countries to prevent illegal 
   activities, etc. Agreements for cooperation in the areas identified thus 
   far are expected to be signed shortly. 
  <br>-18&gt; 
    
   <br><br>President of Sri Lanka, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, came to India from 1 to 
   3 October 1992 in his capacity as Chairman of the Sixth SAARC Summit. 
   The visit also served as a State visit in view of the fact that this was 
   his first visit to India as President of Sri Lanka. The President of Sri 
   Lanka and the Prime Minister confirmed the validity of SAARC as a forum 
   for enhancing interaction among countries of the region. Issues of 
   common interest to SAARC countries, discussed during the visit, included 
   poverty alleviation, SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), 
   cooperation to combat terrorism, etc. The two sides also undertook a 
   review of bilateral matters such as repatriation of Sri Lankan refugees, 
   practical problems faced by fishermen from both countries and economic 
   cooperation. The two sides expressed satisfaction over the on-going 
   return of Sri Lankan refugees to their country and agreed to continue 
   the cooperation to ensure an early return of these refugees from India. 
   From 21 January 1992 till 2 October 1992, over 29,000 Sri Lankan 
   refugees had returned to their country. The process has been temporarily 
   suspended and is expected to be resumed shortly. Regarding problems 
   faced by fishermen from both the countries straying into each others 
   waters, the two sides agreed to deal with such cases in a spirit of 
   mutual accommodation and understanding and to initiate discussions on 
   the subject at the level of senior officials. 
    
   <br><br>On the ethnic question in Sri Lanka, India reiterated her considered and 
   consistent view that the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil Community 
   should be fulfilled within the framework of a united Sri Lanka through 
   negotiations involving all parties which have eschewed violence. The Sri 
   Lankan side briefed the Indian side about the present position and 
   future prospects as seen by them. 
    
   <br><br>The year 1992 saw expanding cooperation in various areas between India 
   and Sri Lanka. The second meeting of the Sub-Commission on Trade, 
   Finance and Investment was held in New Delhi in September 1992. Meetings 
   of the other two Sub-Commissions on Social, Cultural and Educational 
   matters, and on Science and Technology are also due to be convened 
   shortly. During President Premadasa's visit, the two sides expressed 
   satisfaction over the progress with regard to various proposals under 
   the auspices of the Joint Commission. During the year, there were 
   increasing contacts between the business communities of the two 
   countries., as illustrated by the convening of the Indo-Sri Lanka joint 
   Business Council in Delhi in March 1992, after a lapse of 11 years, and 
   the participation of over 100 business delegates from India in the 
   EXPO'92 held in Colombo in November 1992. The visit of the Sri Lankan 
   Minister for Industry, Science and 
    
    
   Technology to India in March 1992 also provided an opportunity for an 
   useful exchange of views. 
   <br>-19&gt;
   <br><br>In the wake of Ayodhya incident, it was heartening to receive the 
   message sent by President Premadasa to Prime Minister on 8 December 1992 
   appreciating the principled stand of Prime Minister and the Government 
   of India. on the Ayodhya developments. The restraint and maturity shown 
   by the Government and people of Sri Lanka in reacting to the Ayodhya 
   developments is worthy of commendation. 
    
   <br><br>Existing close and friendly relations with Maldives were further 
   consolidated and reinforced by regular consultation and meetings which 
   resulted in close understanding at the highest level. Prime Minister met 
   President Gayoom in Rio during the Earth Summit in June 1992 and again 
   in Jakarta in September 1992 during the 10th NAM Summit. These high 
   level contacts provided an opportunity to assess the on-going multi- 
   dimensional cooperation programmes which encompass infrastructure 
   development, health and welfare, civil aviation, communication and 
   manpower resource development of Maldives. 
    
   <br><br>The Second Session of Indo-Maldives joint Commission for Economic and 
   Technical Cooperation was held at New Delhi on 2 and 3 March 1992. The 
   joint Commission looked into every aspect of non-military bilateral 
   relations between the two countries. 
    
   <br><br>Maldivian Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Mr Abdul Rasheed 
   Hussain, led a 6-member delegation to New Delhi to attend a conference 
   organized jointly by UNICEF and Department of Women and Child 
   Development from 3 to 5 June 1992. 
    
   <br><br>Maldivian Minister of State and Head of Customs, Mr Hussain Manikfann, 
   visited India for two weeks from 10 to 24 October 1992 to familiarise 
   himself with the Customs Regulations in India. 
    
   <br><br>Defence Secretary, Shri N N Vohra, visited Maldives from 19 to 21 
   December 1992 to discuss various matters connected with Indo-Maldives 
   defence cooperation. During his stay in Male, Shri Vohra met President 
   Gayoom, Foreign Minister Fathulla Jameel and Director General of 
   National Security Service (NSS), Mr Abdul Sattar Anbaree. 
    
   <br><br>Relations with Pakistan, however, continued to be under strain on 
   account of Pakistan's negative approach. Pakistan's interference in 
   India's internal affairs and support to subversion and terrorism 
   directed against India not 
    
    
   only continued in the States of Punjab and Jammu &amp; Kashmir but assumed 
   new dimensions. There is, however, growing international realization and 
   concern at Pakistan's involvement with terrorism directed against India. 
   In line with its proclivity to interfere in India's internal affairs, 
   the Pakistani leadership sought to make statements and agitate public 
   opinion in that country on matters such as developments in Ayodhya which 
   were purely the internal affair of India. 
  <br>-20&gt; 
   <br><br>India has, in the interest of peace and security of the region and in 
   accordance with the Simla Agreement, pursued the path of bilateral 
   dialogue with Pakistan in an attempt to create an atmosphere of mutual 
   trust and confidence. In April 1992, some proposals on Military 
   Confidence Building Measures were forwarded to Pakistan. The sixth round 
   of Foreign Secretary level talks between India and Pakistan which were 
   scheduled from 1 to 3 June 1992 had to be postponed as Pakistan vitiated 
   the atmosphere by the abduction and brutal torture of a senior Indian 
   diplomat in Islamabad in violation of all accepted norms on the 
   treatment of diplomatic personnel. The dialogue got back on track after 
   the Prime Ministers of the two countries met at Rio on 14 June 1992 when 
   they agreed that bilateral talks should be resumed. Consequently, a 
   meeting was held from 6 to 9 August 1992 on the Tulbal Navigation 
   Project. All legal and technical aspects were discussed. Pakistan's 
   clearance on the joint draft (worked out in October 1991) is awaited. 
   This was followed by the sixth round of Foreign Secretary level talks 
   from 16 to 19 August 1992, when the two sides: 
    
   <br><br>(i) Exchanged the Instruments of Ratification on the Agreement on 
   Prevention of Air Space Violations by military aircraft and the 
   Agreement on Advance Notice of Military Exercises, Manoeuvres and Troop 
   Movements; 
    
   <br><br>(ii)      Signed the Code of Conduct on the treatment of 
   Diplomatic/Consular personnel; 
    
   <br><br>(iii) Issued the Joint Declaration on complete prohibition of chemical 
   weapons; 
    
   <br><br>(iv)      Agreed to discuss a joint declaration on biological weapons 
   along the lines of the joint declaration on chemical weapons; 
    
   <br><br>(v) Reaffirmed the agreement, in principle, to convene the Sub- 
   Commissions of the India-Pakistan joint Commission at an appropriate 
   time. It was agreed that, in the meanwhile, senior officials of 
   concerned Ministries (Commerce, Education &amp; Culture and Home) could 
   meet; 
  <br>-21&gt; 
    
   <br><br>(vi) Extended a formal invitation to the Pakistan's COAS to visit, 
   India; and 
    
   <br><br>(vii) Agreed on a series of meetings at the official level: on Siachen 
   at the Defence Secretary level (October/November 1992); on Sir Creek 
   (September 1992); on technical discussions on the issue of missing 
   defence personnel (September/October 1992); and on India-Pak Committee 
   on Drug Trafficking and Smuggling. 
    
   <br><br>The sixth round of talks on the Siachen issue between the Defence 
   Secretaries of India and Pakistan were held in New Delhi from 2 to 4 
   November 1992. These talks were resumed after a gap of three years. 
   Proposals to carry forward the dialogue from the fifth round of talks 
   (June 1989) aimed at a comprehensive resolution of the Siachen issue 
   were discussed. 
    
   <br><br>The fifth round of India-Pakistan talks on the Sir Creek issue were held 
   in New Delhi on 5 and 6 November 1992. The two sides had a detailed and 
   useful exchange of views on the various issues involved. They agreed 
   that the discussions would be continued on a mutually convenient date. 
    
   <br><br>The Pakistan Foreign Secretary during his meeting with the Prime 
   Minister on 17 August 1992 handed over a letter from the Prime Minister 
   of Pakistan proposing bilateral discussions on Jammu &amp; Kashmir under 
   Article 6 of the Simla Agreement. It has been conveyed to Pakistan that 
   the Simla Agreement provides the necessary framework for resolving the 
   entire range of different issues affecting bilateral relations. 
   Negotiations within the framework of Simla Agreement cannot be 
   compartmentalized or fragmented under one specific article of the 
   Agreement removed from the context. It is ironical that Pakistan so soon 
   after suggesting bilateral talks under Article 6 of the Simla Agreement 
   preferred to raise Kashmir in violation of the Simla Agreement at the 
   international fora including at the 10th NAM Summit at Jakarta and UN 
   General Assembly (UNGA) plenary session. Pakistan has yet to demonstrate 
   its sincerity about seriously pursuing meaningful bilateral discussions. 
   This can take place only in an atmosphere of mutual trust and 
   confidence. For this, Pakistan must stop its support to terrorism and 
   cease interference in India's internal affairs. Unfortunately, within 
   days of Foreign Secretary level talks, Pakistan National Assembly passed 
   a Resolution on the Babri Masjid issue (28 August). 
    
  <br><br> On 15 October 1992, two Pakistani nationals alongwith terrorist 
   Talwinder Singh Parmar were killed in an encounter near jullundar. 
   Pakistan's allegation that these two Pakistani nationals were killed in 
   cold blood is 
    
    
   unfounded and was only to detract Attention from the fact that these two 
   Pakistani nationals were without valid visas and in the company of 
   terrorists with arms and ammunition. 
  <br>-22&gt; 
   <br><br>An attempt was made to cross the LOC on 24 October 1992. Earlier, 
   attempts had been made on 11 February 1992 and 30 March 1992. 
    
   <br><br>In an effort to curtail people-to-people contacts, Pakistan issued an 
   Advisory to its citizens on 2 December 1992 not to travel to India and 
   suggesting that those in India should curtail their stay and return 
   home. 
    
   <br><br>Following developments in Ayodhya, the Government of Pakistan took a 
   series of steps which can only be viewed by India as an attempt to 
   interfere in her internal affairs. Vituperative statements by leaders of 
   Pakistan including at the highest level, resolutions passed by Pakistan 
   National Assembly and Pakistan Senate on the demolition of Babri Masjid 
   and the decision of Government of Pakistan to officially call for 
   nationwide strike on 8 December 1992 to mark a "day of mourning" were 
   highly regrettable and unacceptable. Pakistan, or for that matter, no 
   other country has any locus standi on the developments in Ayodhya. 
    
   <br><br>The situation was further aggravated when the Indian diplomatic premises 
   in Islamabad and Karachi were targets of mob fury on 8 December. Mobs 
   ransacked and burnt the residence of the Indian Consul General in 
   Karachi. This was in violation of not only the international norms on 
   the inviolability of diplomatic premises but of the recently signed Code 
   of Conduct between the two countries, under which the receiving 
   Government is to extend protection to diplomatic/consular property and 
   personnel. In the prevailing circumstances, Government were forced to 
   evacuate the families of officials in Karachi. 
    
   <br><br>Through a unilateral decision Pakistan (on 29 December 1992) asked India 
   to reduce by 31 January 1993 the strength of the Consulate General in 
   Karachi to 20 (4 diplomats and 16 staff members). Government have 
   conveyed to Pakistan that parity of the representation between Indian 
   High Commission in Islamabad and the Pakistan High Commission in New 
   Delhi should be maintained at 110. Pakistan was asked to withdraw its 
   excess staff from India by 10 February 1993. It has been conveyed to 
   Pakistan that henceforth it would not be allowed to operate temporary 
   visa offices in India. Pakistan has also been informed that it has not 
   been found possible to accede to its request for use of 'Jinnah House' 
   for its Consulate General in Bombay or as official residence for its 
   Consul General. 
   <br>-23&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The downward trend in India-Pakistan bilateral relations has been caused 
   by Pakistan's propensity to interfere in India's internal affairs and 
   its continued support to subversion and terrorism directed against 
   India. Government are of the firm view that while there could be no 
   compromise on the unity and integrity of the nation, attempts should be 
   made to resolve differences with Pakistan bilaterally and peacefully on 
   the basis of the Simla Agreement and in the interest of peace and 
   stability in the region. Government have urged the Government of 
   Pakistan to abandon its negative approach and join in sincere efforts to 
   have a meaningful dialogue. For this, Pakistan's support to terrorism 
   must stop. Government hope that Pakistan will reciprocate the desire for 
   peace and not persist with its present policies which are a negation of 
   the accepted fundamental principles of inter-state conduct and the Simla 
   Agreement. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with Afghanistan are based on traditional ties of 
   common history and culture. The past year also saw some high level 
   exchanges. President of Afghanistan, Prof Burhanuddin Rabbani, made a 
   stop-over in New Delhi on 30 August 1992. The Afghan Minister of State 
   for Foreign Affairs, Mr Najibullah Laffraei, visited Delhi during 
   November 1992. India maintained useful exchanges with the new leadership 
   in Afghanistan. 
    
   <br><br>India has always stood for a sovereign, independent, non-aligned and 
   united Afghanistan. Government believe that a political settlement 
   taking into account the legitimate interests of all concerned should be 
   arrived at by the Afghans themselves without any form of external 
   interference. India offered Rs 5 crores worth of assistance through the 
   Office of UN Coordinators for Afghan Refugee Rehabilitation and an equal 
   amount bilaterally during 1992. India supplied relief items worth Rs 1.5 
   crores to Afghanistan through UNCOA. As a part of India's bilateral 
   commitment, Indian relief supplies worth Rs 4.7 crores of essential 
   items as well as medicines and medical equipments have also been 
   completed during 1992. 
    
   <br><br>The transitionary phase in Afghanistan has been greatly complicated. A 
   conflict situation has arisen involving various Afghan groups. Intense 
   fighting has erupted around Kabul forcing the closure of several 
   diplomatic missions, including India's. The absence of any political 
   process, leading to a settlement acceptable to all sections of the 
   Afghan people, has accentuated sectarian and ethnic tensions which could 
   seriously undermine Afghanistan's unified character as a nation state. A 
   renewed international peace initiative, possibly under UN auspices, is 
   urgently called for. 
   <br>-24&gt; 
    
   <br><br>India continued to play an important and crucial role in the South Asian 
   Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Recommendations of the 6th 
   SAARC Summit were jointly implemented by India and other member 
   countries, and she contributed to their success in the best possible way 
   in the light of her resources and capabilities. In pursuance with the 
   Colombo Summit directive, India held the SAARC Ministerial meeting on 
   environmental issues in Delhi in April 1992. The meeting adopted a joint 
   Communique reflecting the consensus of views of SAARC countries on 
   environment and development which was presented to UN Conference on 
   Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio in June 1992. Another SAARC 
   Ministerial Conference on Children in South Asia was held in Colombo in 
   September 1992. It adopted a Resolution in which 'illustrative regional 
   goals' based on National Plan of Action of the Member States in 
   education, maternal health, nutrition, access to drinking water, etc, to 
   promote the welfare of children were identified. 
    
   <br><br>One of the notable achievements of SAARC during the period under review 
   was the drawing up of a draft framework agreement on establishment of 
   SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) by the Secretary-level 
   Committee on Economic Cooperation (CEC) in November 1992 in pursuance of 
   a mandate received from &amp; 6th SAARC Summit. The framework agreement 
   envisages trade liberalisation through a product by product approach to 
   reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade among SAARC 
   countries to be established within three years of the signing of the 
   Agreement by the SAARC Council of Ministers. 
    
  <br><br>Another related development in the area of economic cooperation was the 
   establishment of a SAARC fund for identification and development of 
   regional Projects of $ 5 million through proportionate contributions 
   from the member States. A Regional Council of Development Financing 
   Institutions (RCDFI) has been established to manage this fund. 
    
   <br><br>In accordance with a decision of the 6th SAARC Summit, an independent 
   South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation, consisting of eminent 
   persons from all member States, was constituted to conduct an in-depth 
   study on diverse experiences of the seven countries on poverty 
   alleviation. The Commission has already completed its work and its 
   recommendations will be placed before the 7th SAARC Summit. 
    
   <br><br>Under the aegis of the SAARC, so far approximately 44 activities have 
   been held in 1992. These include special training courses, seminars, 
   meetings, workshops, joint research projects, technical studies, etc. 
   Almost one third 
    
    
   of the total activities were held in India. The trend in the SAARC is to 
   shift towards concrete development-oriented discussions in core areas, 
   such as, in economic cooperation, environment, poverty alleviation, etc. 
   <br>-25&gt; 
   <br><br>The year 1993 was announced as the SAARC Year of Disabled Persons by the 
   5th Summit held in Male. A Plan of action has been drawn up to observe 
   this year appropriately. The Plan envisages programmes at both national 
   and regional levels. 
    
   <br><br>Since India is committed to collective self-reliance among the SAARC 
   Countries, it has always advocated in SAARC fora, the utilisation of 
   resources available within the region for its programmes or activities. 
   However, lately India has, in due deference to the demands of the member 
   States for international assistance, agreed. to a proposed SAARC-Japan 
   Special Fund of $ 5 million to be used partly for SAARC programmes and 
   partly to provide intellectual exchange between Japan and the SAARC 
   member States. SAARC has also authorised the Chairman of the Council of 
   Ministers to carry out informal consultations with the EEC and the ASEAN 
   in order to identify mutual beneficial areas of cooperation with them. 
    
   <br><br>India continued to play an active role in the SAARC with the hope that 
   it can develop into an effective vehicle for promoting the economic, 
   social, technical, scientific and cultural development of the countries 
   of the region, as it is required to do under its Charter. 
    
   <br><br>The 7th SAARC Summit originally scheduled to be held on 12 and 13 
   December 1992 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was postponed by a month to 13 and 
   14 January 1993 in the wake of post-Ayodhya developments. India had 
   agreed to these new dates in the hope that the situation in and around 
   India would have stabilised and the political tensions in the region 
   would have abated by then. 
    
   <br><br>Unfortunately, the Summit had to be postponed for the second time, at 
   India's behest, because of continued vitiated political atmosphere and 
   actions in some member States amounting to interference in the internal 
   affairs of India. It was felt that the political direction needed at 
   that stage to provide greater content and substance to regional 
   cooperation in South Asia could not be achieved under circumstances then 
   prevailing. 
    
   <br><br>The new dates of the Summit are to be decided through diplomatic 
   channels.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>INDIA'S TRADITIONALLY CLOSE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE MEMBER 
   COUNTRIES of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and with 
   the countries in Indo-China were maintained and broadened by numerous 
   high level contacts during 1992-93. India decided to give a special 
   policy thrust to its relations with the ASEAN. 
    
   <br><br>Bilateral relations with Malaysia were enhanced with the two countries 
   having regular exchange of views at different levels. The Malaysian 
   Defence Minister Dato Seri Najib visited India in March 1992 and had 
   meetings with Prime Minister and Raksha Mantri. 
    
   <br><br>The two countries signalled upgradation of economic and trade ties by 
   raising the joint Trade Committee to a full-fledged joint Commission. 
   The first session of the Indo-Malaysian Joint Commission was held in 
   Kuala Lumpur on 2 and 3 November 1992, co-chaired by the Malaysian 
   Foreign Minister and the then Minister of State for External Affairs, 
   Shri Eduardo Faleiro. The Joint Commission has provided the necessary 
   impetus to the existing trade and economic exchanges between the two 
   countries. 
    
   <br><br>The bilateral content of India's relationship with Malaysia comprises 
   joint ventures, project exports and trade in commodities, particularly 
   palm oil, petroleum crude, rubber and tin from Malaysia. As per agreed 
   minutes signed by the Malaysian Minister for Primary Industries and the 
   Minister of State for Commerce in August 1992, India is to import 
   atleast 3,00,000 tons of palm oil annually for two years. In 
   consideration of this, the Malaysian Government has expressed 
   willingness to use the Evidence Account Mechanism for providing the 
   necessary fillip to the arrangement. 
    
  <br><br> The momentum of these exchanges was kept up with Prime Minister meeting 
   the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, during the NAM Summit in 
   Jakarta in September 1992. 
    
   <br><br>Foreign Secretary visited Malaysia from 29 to 31 January 1993, to have 
   bilateral consultations with Mr Tan Sri Ahmad Kamil, Secretary-General 
   of 
    
    
   the Malaysian Foreign Office. Discussions focussed, inter alia, on 
   preparations for the impending visit of the Defence Minister to 
   Malaysia, certain bilateral issues such as the new visa regulation 
   introduced by Malaysia, delay in Indian import of palm oil and import of 
   petroleum and petroleum products. There were also exchange of views on 
   the G-15 Summit as well as on the security environment in South-East 
   Asia in the context of evolving perceptions in ASEAN region about China 
   and Japan. 
   <br>-27&gt; 
   <br><br>Raksha Mantri, Shri Sharad Pawar, visited Malaysia from 1 to 7 February 
   1993 at the invitation of the Malaysian Defence Minister Datuk Najib. 
   During the visit, the Defence Minister signed a Memorandum of 
   Understanding for cooperation in the defence field. The MOU provides for 
   logistical support by India for the MIG-29 aircrafts which Malaysia is 
   negotiating to purchase from Russia. Besides, the MOU will focus on 
   defence infrastructure build-up, modernisation and training of ground 
   forces, regular exchange of personnel, and limited joint production 
   ventures in Air and Naval armament. 
    
  <br><br> India's relations with Singapore have been marked by the readiness 
   stressed by both sides to embark on a new phase of understanding and 
   cooperation for mutual benefit. Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and 
   Minister of Trade and Industry, Brig Gen Lee Hsien Loong, accompanied by 
   a high-powered delegation, was on an official visit to India from 22 to 
   27 March 1992. Brig Gen Lee had meetings with the Prime Minister, 
   Finance Minister, Minister of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and Minister 
   of State for Commerce. In his discussions with Prime Minister, Brig Gen 
   Lee expressed interest in a series of exhibitions from India to be held 
   in Singapore with the cooperation of the Government of India. Emphasis 
   was placed on future trade and investment ties between India and 
   Singapore. A proposal for an India-Singapore Industrial Corridor in the 
   State of Tamil Nadu also came up for examination. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister's meeting with Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok 
   Tong, during the Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta in September 1992 
   provided a further fillip to the multi-sided relationship. The Prime 
   Minister of Singapore evinced keen interest in getting skilled personnel 
   from India for projects in third countries. He also proposed the setting 
   up of a permanent exhibition of Indian culture in the Singapore Museum 
   to highlight the different cultural streams represented in Singapore. 
   Prime Minister Goh identified trade and investment as another important 
   area of cooperation. He mentioned the need for India to hold trade fairs 
   in Singapore and participate in fairs as a means of increasing her 
   exports. Prime Minister offered full cooperation for sending cultural 
   exhibits from India and welcomed the prospect for defence cooperation. 
   <br>-28&gt; 
    
  <br><br> Mr B G George Yeo, Singapore's Minister for Information and the Arts and 
   Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited India from 4 to 15 February 
   1993 at the invitation of Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri 
   Arjun Singh. The Minister led a high level delegation which included the 
   Senior Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Lim Boon Heng, senior 
   officials from the field of art and culture, trade and industry and 
   businessmen. The visit symbolised the desire of both countries to 
   significantly upgrade existing relations. The visiting Minister called 
   on the Prime Minister and handed over a letter from the Prime Minister 
   of Singapore. 
    
  <br><br> He also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Cooperation in the 
   Arts, Archives and Heritage with Minister for Human Resource 
   Development. The other Ministers with whom he had exchange of views 
   included Finance Minister, Commerce Minister and Minister of State for 
   External Affairs, Shri Salman Khurshid. Besides Delhi, the delegation 
   visited Agra, Jaipur, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras. 
    
   <br><br>India's friendly relations with the Philippines continued. India warmly 
   congratulated and assured full cooperation to the new leadership in the 
   Philippines under President Ramos after the General Elections held in 
   May 1992. Volcanic eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in August 1992 caused 
   massive destruction in the Philippines. India sent a token relief 
   assistance of essential medicines worth Rs 5 lakhs for the quake 
   victims. 
    
   <br><br>India continued to work closely with Indonesia both bilaterally as well 
   as in the Non-Aligned forum and contributed to the success of the NAM 
   Summit in Jakarta under Indonesia's chairmanship. 
    
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   visited Indonesia for the Non-Aligned Ministerial Meeting in Bali in May 
   1992. Mr Ali Alatas, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, visited New 
   Delhi in July 1992 as Special Envoy of President Soeharto, to hold 
   consultations and to invite the Prime Minister to attend the Non-Aligned 
   Summit in Jakarta in September 1992. During the NAM Summit, the Prime 
   Minister had full exchange of views in his meeting with President 
   Soeharto on NAM as well as bilateral issues of mutual interest. Shri 
   Eduardo Faleiro and Shri R L Bhatia, Minister of State for External 
   Affairs, also attended the NAM Summit. The momentum of regular 
   consultations was kept up with the Prime Minister meeting President 
   Soeharto again in Dakar during the G-15 Summit in November 1992. 
    
  <br><br> The Indonesian Minister of Industry, Mr Hartarto, accompanied by a large 
   delegation comprising of senior officials and business and industrial 
   
    
   representatives visited India in March 1992. Mr Hartarto had meetings 
   with Prime Minister, Minister of State for Industry and Minister of 
   State for Commerce. During the visit, an Agreement was signed between 
   M/s Ballarpur Industries and an Indonesian company for setting up of a 
   rayon pulp joint venture in Sumatra, Indonesia. 
  <br>-29&gt; 
   <br><br>India's traditional and historical ties with Thailand registered an 
   important step with the State Visit of His Royal Highness Maha 
   Vajiralongkorn, the Crown Prince of Thailand, in April 1992. During the 
   visit, the Crown Prince had meetings with the President, the Vice 
   President and the Prime Minister. This was the first ever visit to India 
   by the Crown Prince of Thailand. 
    
   <br><br>Foreign Secretary visited Thailand on 1 and 2 February 1993 for detailed 
   discussions with his counterpart, Thai Permanent Secretary, Dr Pracha 
   Guna-Kasem, on all aspects of bilateral relations and regional and 
   multilateral issues. The two Foreign Secretaries expressed the desire to 
   increase bilateral cooperation in diverse fields encompassing trade and 
   commerce, technology, defence and culture. Human rights and 
   environmental issues were also discussed. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with Brunei Darussalam were given a boost by the State 
   visit to India of the Sultan of Brunei in September 1992. This was the 
   first ever State visit paid by the Sultan of Brunei to India. During the 
   visit, the Sultan had meetings with the President, the Vice President 
   and the Prime Minister. The President hosted a banquet in his honour and 
   the Prime Minister had a luncheon where the Sultan met eminent Indians 
   from all walks of life. Following discussions, a decision was taken for 
   both countries to set up Resident High Commissions in each other's 
   capitals and to exchange delegations to identify areas of cooperation. 
   Brunei Darussalam had already set up a Resident Mission in Delhi in 
   August 1992, headed by an Acting High Commissioner. 
    
   <br><br>Relations with Cambodia continued to be close and friendly. India 
   remained committed to the implementation of the Paris Accord and in 
   response to requests from the United Nations, contributed about 1800 
   military and civilian personnel for the operations of the UN 
   Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). 
    
   <br><br>Shri Eduardo Faleiro, the then Minister of State for External Affairs, 
   represented India at a Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation and 
   Reconstruction of Cambodia held in Tokyo in June 1992. Shri Faleiro laid 
   stress on the urgency of international support for implementation of the 
   UN peace plan as per the 
   -30&gt; 
    
   Paris Accords by the active cooperation of all the Cambodian parties. He 
   also announced the readiness of India to continue with approximately $ 
   1.2 million worth of assistance to Cambodia despite her constraints. 
   There was general appreciation at the conference about the role India 
   has played in Cambodia throughout the two decades preceding the Paris 
   Accords, during the phase of negotiations for the Accords and 
   subsequently. Shri Faleiro also made it known that expertise, 
   appropriate technology and pertinent experience are available in India 
   for use in Cambodia under the appropriate auspices, be it the UNTAC or 
   <br><br>UNDP or through third country or multilateral aid givers. 
<br>-30&gt; <br><br>

<tr><td>Apart from grant of food aid consisting of 2000 tons of rice, medicines 
   worth approximately US $ 600,000 have been sent to Cambodia. 
   Arrangements are also being made to hold artificial limb fitment camps 
   in Cambodia. India continued to provide scholarships to Cambodian 
   nominees for technical training in India and Indian doctors were already 
   on deputation to work at a Cambodian hospital. India also continued to 
   carry out the project on restoration work at the famous Angkor Vat 
   temple in Cambodia. 
    
   <br><br>The Prime Minister met Prince Sihanouk in Jakarta in September 1992. 
   During the meeting, Prince Sihanouk expressed great appreciation for 
   India's help and participation in the peace process and also in 
   Cambodia's reconstruction. 
    
   <br><br>India's traditional relations with Vietnam were further strengthened by 
   exchange of high level visits with special emphasis laid on enhancing 
   bilateral economic, scientific and technical cooperation. The Foreign 
   Minister of Vietnam, Mr Nguyen Manh Cam, paid an official visit to India 
   from 21 to 27 March 1992. He met the President, the Vice President, the 
   Prime Minister and the then Minister of External Affairs and exchanged 
   views on regional and bilateral issues. Broad identity of views emerged 
   and it was agreed that strengthened bilateral relations between India 
   and Vietnam would endure in the emerging international situation. The 
   fifth session of the Indo-Vietnam Joint Commission was held on 24 and 25 
   March 1992. Discussions focussed on enhancement of cooperation in 
   existing areas, especially in the field of trade and commerce, as well 
   as identification of new areas of cooperation. The Cultural Exchange 
   Programme for 1992-94 was also signed. 
    
  <br><br> The Prime Minister had a meeting with President Vo Chi Cong of Vietnam 
   in Jakarta during the Non-Aligned Summit in September 1992. 
    
   <br><br>The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr Do Muoi, led 
   a high level delegation to India from 8 to 13 September 1992. This was 
   Mr Do Muoi's first visit to India and his first visit outside the 
   Socialist States. 
   <br>-31&gt; 
    
   <br><br>He had meetings with the President, the Vice President, the Prime 
   Minister and the Finance Minister. The Prime Minister led the Indian 
   delegation for the official talks. General Secretary Do Muoi stressed 
   the need to give enhanced economic content to the excellent relations 
   with India. New areas were identified for bilateral trade in commodities 
   with a view to expanding the trade turnover. The visit of Mr Do Muoi 
   constituted a new landmark in IndoVietnam relations and opened up broad 
   prospects for cementing the bonds of traditional friendship and multi- 
   faceted cooperation between the two countries. 
    
   <br><br>India's friendly relations and economic cooperation with Laos were 
   maintained. Laotian trainees continued to visit India for training in 
   diverse fields under the India Technical and Economic Cooperation 
   Programme (ITEC). In July 1992, India sent a gift of items of stationery 
   for Lao school children. 
    
   <br><br>Bilateral relations with Australia continued to progress with economic 
   and commercial cooperation assuming enhanced importance. The visit of 
   Australian Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr John Kerin, 
   to India from 25 to 29 February 1992, leading a Government trade 
   delegation, to participate in the Joint Ministerial Commission, was 
   ample testimony of the importance India placed in her economic and 
   commercial relations with Australia. The Indian side was led by the then 
   Minister of State for Commerce, Shri Chidambaram. The meeting enabled 
   the visiting Australian Minister to witness at first hand, India's 
   strong commitment to economic reforms and liberalisation. 
    
   <br><br>Trade between India and Australia hovered in the region of US $ 1 
   billion. In the first six months of the year, though the balance of 
   trade was in Australia's favour, trade figures stood at US $ 465 million 
   with Indian exports at US $ 90 million and imports at US $ 375 million. 
   The Sixth joint Business Council Meeting was held in Sydney from 23 to 
   25 March 1992 with the Australians showing keen interest in India's 
   economic reforms. The India-Australia Joint Business Council (JBC) met 
   in Delhi on 16 and 17 February 1993. 
    
   <br><br>A high-level parliamentary delegation from India led by the Speaker, 
   Shri Shivraj Patil, visited Australia from 21 to 30 June 1992. The visit 
   afforded the delegation an occasion to study parliamentary practices and 
   procedures being followed in Australia and was the first visit of an 
   Indian Parliamentary delegation since 1984. 
    
   <br><br>Exchanges with Australia at the unofficial level on strategic matters 
   continued. A Workshop on Maritime Security jointly organized by the 
   Institute of 
    
    
   Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA) and the Indian Ocean Centre for 
   Peace Studies (IOCPS), Perth, was held in New Delhi from 19 to 21 
   November 1992 with eminent personalities and specialists from both India 
   and Australia taking part. 
    <br>-32&gt;
   <br><br>Bilateral relations with New Zealand received a fillip with the visit of 
   Mr Don McKinnon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of New 
   Zealand, in June 1992 on the occasion of the inauguration of the newly 
   built premises of the New Zealand High Commission in New Delhi. Besides 
   attending the meetings of the Joint Trade Committee and the Joint 
   Business Council, Mr McKinnon also had meetings with the then Minister 
   of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro. 
    
   <br><br>The situation in Fiji continued to receive close attention. After 
   parliamentary elections in May 1992, Mr Rabuka was installed as Prime 
   Minister. Except for setting up a Joint Parliamentary Committee in 
   connection with the review of the Constitution of 1990, the Rabuka 
   Government failed to do anything tangible for improving the lot of the 
   Fijians of Indian origin. 
    
   <br><br>Despite press reports suggesting willingness on the part of Mr Rabuka 
   and other members of his Government for normalisation of relations with 
   India, no official communication or confirmation in, this regard was 
   received. 
    
   <br><br>India continued to highlight the institutionalised. racial 
   discrimination being perpetuated in Fiji at appropriate international 
   fora and during bilateral meetings. 
    
   <br><br>The Ban on commercial and technical cooperation with Fiji continued to 
   remain in force. Scholarships were given to deserving Fijian students.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW SAW THE CONSOLIDATION AND STRENGTHENING OF 
   friendly relations between India and China which started with the of the 
   then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi to China in December 1988 and 
   gained momentum with the visit of Premier Li Peng to India in December 
   1991. The highlight of the year was the State visit by former President, 
   Shri R Venkataraman, to China from 18 to 23 May 1992, the first such 
   visit to China by an Indian Head of State since the establishment of 
   diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1950. 
   Another important landmark was the visit of Raksha Mantri to China in 
   July, establishing formal links between the defence establishments of 
   the two countries. 
    
  <br><br> The former President's discussions with Chinese leaders such as 
   President Yang Shangkun, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li 
   Peng, confirmed the commitment of both the countries to the development 
   of a positive momentum in India-China relations and the desire of both 
   the countries to further strengthen their friendly, good neighbourly and 
   mutually beneficial relations. 
    
   <br><br>The visit of the Raksha Mantri can be seen as part of the confidence- 
   building effort of both the countries in order to enhance mutual 
   understanding and trust and establish a tension-free border, a necessary 
   step to peacefully settle the pending issues between India and China, 
   including the boundary question. 
    
   <br><br> momentum of high-level exchanges was maintained by a number of 
   Chinese Ministers visiting India in early 1992, such as their Auditor 
   General, Mr Lu Peijian, in January, the State Councillor and Chairman, 
   State Education Commission, Mr Li Tieying, in February/March and the 
   Minister of Civil Affairs, Mr Cui Naifu, in April. Chinese Party leaders 
   also attended the annual conclaves of the CPI (M) and the CPI in the 
   early part of the year. From India, besides Raksha Mantri, Minister of 
   Welfare, Shri Sitaram Kesri, and Minister of Human Resource Development, 
   Shri Arjun Singh, also visited China in October. The first Chinese 
   National People's Congress 
    
    
   (NPC) delegation led by its Vice Chairman, Mr Liao Hansheng, visited 
   India in December. High-level party delegations from the CPI(M), 
   AICC(l), CPI and the Telegu Desam also visited China during the course 
   of the year. The Chinese Communist Party sent a delegation headed by Mr 
   Wu Bangguo, Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary (who was subsequently 
   inducted as Politburo member at the Party's 14th Congress), which 
   visited India at the invitation of the AICC W in September. 
  <br>-34&gt; 
   <br><br>Another significant event in the year was the holding of the Festival of 
   China in India. As agreed during Prime Minister Shri P V Narasimha Rao's 
   talks with Premier Li Peng in Delhi in December 1991, the Festival of 
   China in India was inaugurated by the Vice President, Shri K R 
   Narayanan, and the Vice Chairman of the Chinese National People's 
   Congress, Mr Liao Hansheng, on 2 December 1992 at a glittering ceremony 
   at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi. The Festival was received with 
   tremendous enthusiasm in 11 cities across India. Over a hundred artistes 
   and artisans from China participated in the events. A Festival of India 
   in China is to be held in the near future. 
    
   <br><br>The Agreement on re-opening of Consulates-General of India and China in 
   Shanghai and Bombay respectively, arrived at during the Chinese 
   Premier's visit to India in 1991, was implemented and both Consulates- 
   General are now functional. The Chinese Consulate General in Bombay was 
   formally inaugurated by Mr Liao Hansheng on 7 December 1992. 
    
   <br><br>Discussion on the boundary question continued within the Joint Working 
   Group (JWG) set up for this purpose. Significantly, the JWG met twice 
   for the first time during the same calendar year: in February and 
   October. The year also saw mutual defence representation on the JWG for 
   the first time. Agreement was reached on holding of meetings of border 
   personnel of the two countries and the establishment of direct telephone 
   links between such personnel on the boundary. These agreements are being 
   implemented. Further confidence-building measures to ensure the 
   maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the line of actual control 
   are being discussed in the JWG. 
    
   <br><br>A major move was the resumption of border trade between Gunji 
   (Pithoragarh District of UP) and Pulan in the Tibet Autonomous Region of 
   China in the June to September trading season in 1992. The smooth flow 
   of such commercial traffic has encouraged the two countries to agree in 
   principle to open further points on the border to such trade. 
   <br>-35&gt; 
    
  <br><br> Trade and economic cooperation and exchanges between the two countries 
   continued to grow during the year under review. Bilateral trade for the 
   first nine calendar months of 1992 was at about the same level as last 
   year. An Orissa-based company and a Chinese steel manufacturer have 
   entered into an agreement to set up a joint venture plant. India's 
   trade, commercial and investment ties with Hong Kong and Taiwan are also 
   growing and their prospects for the future look bright. 
    
   <br><br>The Cultural Exchange Programme is being implemented as are the various 
   agreements on exchanges and cooperation in the fields of education, 
   science and technology, agriculture, audit, civil services and personnel 
   training, etc. 
    
   <br><br>During the high-level dialogue with Chinese leaders, India's concerns 
   about Chinese arms supplies to Pakistan and Myanmar were conveyed. China 
   has expressed her desire to see peace and stability in South Asia and do 
   not wish to see an escalation of the arms race in the region. The 
   discussions also covered the changing international environment and the 
   mutual desire of both the countries to see the establishment of an 
   international order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence 
   and an equitable and mutually beneficial economic order in which the 
   concerns of the developing countries will be addressed. 
    
   <br><br>Official Chinese reaction to the demolition of the mosque at Ayodhya and 
   the resulting communal violence was muted. The Foreign Office spokesman 
   described it as India's internal affair, though as India's neighbouring 
   country, China hoped the problem could be settled peacefully. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with China have therefore shown the resilience and 
   maturity that is necessary for two such large and important neighbours 
   in Asia, which will have a bearing on peace and stability of the region 
   and of the world. 
    
   <br><br>The thrust and momentum generated in recent years in India's relations 
   with Japan continued in 1992-93. The 40th anniversary of the 
   establishment of diplomatic relations and the signing of the Peace 
   Treaty between India and Japan in 1992 added another dimension to her 
   steadily burgeoning relations with Japan which were marked by a spirit 
   of friendship and cooperation in the political, economic and cultural 
   fields. The period under review also marked renewed Japanese interest in 
   India in view of the new economic policies introduced by India. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister, Shri P V Narasimha Rao, visited Japan from 22 to 26 June 
   1992 at the invitation of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Discussions on 
    
    
   various issues with the Japanese Government on both bilateral and 
   multilateral matters were fruitful with new areas for cooperation and 
   consultations being identified. The Prime Minister also met the Japanese 
   Ministers of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and Finance and 
   leaders of the five major economic organizations of Japan as well as of 
   Japanese business and industry having special interest/ties with India. 
   It was also decided to hold, for the first time, bilateral consultations 
   on disarmament and nuclear issues between the two countries at the 
   official level. It is hoped that these talks will result in enhanced 
   mutual understanding relating to their respective security concerns and 
   the emerging international order, particularly in the Asia Pacific 
   region. 
   <br>-36&gt; 
   <br><br>Prince Akishino, second son of Emperor Akihito, accompanied by Princess 
   Akishino, visited India from 12 to 20 November 1992 at the invitation of 
   the Vice President. The Speaker of the House of Representatives of 
   Japan, Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, visited India in August 1992 to commemorate 
   the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations 
   between India and Japan and the 90th anniversary of the Indo-Japanese 
   Association. Agriculture Minister, Shri Balram Jakhar, visited Tokyo 
   from 26 to 29 October 1992 to attend the 30th Congress of the 
   International Cooperation Alliance. Minister of State for Environment, 
   Shri Kamal Nath, visited Japan from 22 to 25 March 1992 to exchange 
   views with his Japanese counterpart prior to the Earth Summit in Rio. A 
   return visit was paid by Mr Shozaburo Nakamura, the Director General of 
   the Japanese Environment Agency (Cabinet Minister), in September 1992 to 
   India for discussions with Minister of State for Environment. 
    
   <br><br>In the economic sphere, the Japanese demonstrated strong interest in 
   India's policy initiatives on economic liberalisation and the opening up 
   of the Indian economy. Japan retained the top slot in the list of 
   India's ODA donors. At the Aid India Consortium meeting in Paris in June 
   1992, Japan pledged a total of Yen 111.91 billion for 1992-93, a 5% 
   increase over the previous year. 
    
   <br><br>Japanese investment in India registered a sharp increase during the 
   year. From Rs 50 million in 1990, investment from Japan rose to Rs 527.1 
   million in 1991. Total Japanese investment commitment in India had risen 
   to Rs 4,684.40 million upto October 1992, making Japan the third largest 
   investor in India after the United States and Switzerland. 
    
  <br><br>Positive interaction was also maintained with Japan at the official 
   level in diverse areas. The India-Japan Foreign Office Consultative 
   Talks were held 
    
    
   in Tokyo on 13 and 14 April 1992. The Ninth India-Japan Trade Talks were 
   held in Delhi in September-October 1992. A Memorandum of Understanding 
   was signed between the Department of Industrial Development and Japan 
   International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to examine the feasibility of 
   establishing an Industrial Model Town (IMT) in India as a pilot project 
   to attract private foreign investment to India. The detailed indepth 
   pre-feasibility report is expected to be ready by the end of 1993. The 
   Indo-Japan Working Group on Railways met in New Delhi from 30 November 
   to 4 December 1992 for wide-ranging discussions and follow up of 
   Japanese aid projects and for Japanese assistance in the upgradation of 
   technology in the Indian Railways. 
   <br>-37&gt; 
   <br><br>At the non-governmental level too, contacts and interaction were 
   sustained at a high level. The India-Japan Study Committee (IJSC) met in 
   Bangalore in May 1992. They examined in particular ways of strengthening 
   the bilateral linkages with stress on specific areas such as science and 
   technology. It was also decided to make the meetings bi-annual in view 
   of the intensification and broadening of areas of cooperation. 
   Subsequently the 22nd Joint Meeting of the IJSC was held on 4 and 5 
   February 1993 in New Delhi where it was agreed, inter alia, to undertake 
   joint studies in areas of mutual interest. The India-Japan Joint 
   Business Council timed its annual meeting this time in Tokyo in June to 
   coincide with Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit. An Investment 
   Promotion Seminar was organized in Japan by FICCI and the Confederation 
   of Indian Industry in September. A delegation of the Japanese 
   Parliamentary Association on Population and Development visited India in 
   October 1992. 
    
   <br><br>In the cultural field, a series of special events were organized both in 
   India and Japan in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of India-Japan 
   diplomatic ties. Japan is also in the process of assisting India in the 
   efforts to preserve her cultural heritage, The Government of Japan sent 
   a high level Cultural Mission to India from 28 to 31 January 1993 for 
   exploring and suggesting ways to increase cultural exchanges between the 
   two countries. 
    
   <br><br>A steady intensification of exchanges and interaction marked India's 
   bilateral relations with the Republic of Korea. President and the Prime 
   Minister congratulated Mr Kim Young Sam, the new President of the 
   Republic of Korea, who assumed office on 25 February 1993. Shri 
   Madhavsinh Solanki, the then Minister for External Affairs, visited the 
   Republic of Korea from 15 to 18 March 1992 at the invitation of Foreign 
   Minister Lee Sang Ock 
    
    
   with whom he had useful exchange of views on matters of mutual interest. 
   An Agreement on Civil Aviation was also signed during the visit which 
   will enable the Korean Airlines to fly to Bombay and Delhi and Air India 
   to fly to Seoul and Pusan. The visit was also utilised to apprise the 
   Government and business community in South Korea about India's new trade 
   and economic reforms and the investment opportunities here. Bilateral 
   consultations at the official level were institutionalised with the 
   first consultations being held in Seoul during the visit. 
    <br>-38&gt;
   Other visits from India included the visit of the then Minister of State 
   for Industry, Prof P J Kurien, on 24 and 25 April 1992 to attend the 
   Sixth Session of the World Assembly of Small and Medium Enterprises 
   (WASME) and the visit of the then Minister of State for Tourism, Shri M 
   0 H Farook, accompanied by high-level officials in June 1992 for 
   discussions with his counterpart on promotion of tourism between the two 
   countries. 
    
   <br><br>Economic and trade relations showed an upward trend. Bilateral trade 
   between the two countries touched Rs 1376 crores recording a trade 
   surplus of Rs 152 crores in India's favour for the first time. The EXIM 
   Bank of Korea extended credit exceeding US $ 500 million for financing 
   important ONGC projects and for purchase of Korean ships by the Shipping 
   Corporation of India. 
    
   <br><br>The visit of Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Gen S F Rodrigues, to the 
   Republic of Korea from 9 to 13 November 1992 was the first ever visit by 
   Chief of Army Staff of India to South Korea and signified the growing 
   interaction between India and the Republic of Korea. Gen Rodrigues had 
   meetings with his counterpart, Gen Kim Jin Yon, and other senior ROK 
   defence officials. 
    
   <br><br>The year also marked increased exchange of delegations of businessmen 
   and industrialists between the two countries. The Indo-Korea joint 
   Business Council (JBC) was held in New Delhi in November 1992. A high- 
   level business delegation sponsored by Indian Merchants Chamber &amp; 
   Association visited the Republic of Korea in October 1992. 
    
   <br><br>At the academic level and person to person level, contacts with the 
   Republic of Korea expanded during the year. The Fourth Indo-Korean 
   Conference was held in New Delhi in November 1992 where scholars from 
   Yonsei University participated with academics from India. A group of 
   prominent citizens from Pusan also visited India while the Academy of 
   Korean Studies undertook its first field trip to India. 
  <br>-39&gt; 
    
  <br><br> India's traditionally cordial relations with the Democratic People's 
   Republic of Korea were maintained. At the invitation of Vice President 
   Li Jong Ok, the then Vice President, Dr Shanker Dayal Sharma, paid a 
   return visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from 14 to 17 
   April 1992. The visit also coincided with the 80th birthday celebration 
   of President Kim Il Sung. The visit was utilised to broaden exchanges, 
   in the political, economic and cultural spheres. Dr Girija Vyas, the 
   then Union Deputy Minister for Information and Broadcasting, visited 
   Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 12 September 1992 to attend the 
   3rd Pyongyang Film Festival of the Non-Aligned and other developing 
   countries. She also used the opportunity to meet the top DPRK leaders 
   and discuss various aspects of bilateral relations. The cultural 
   exchanges between the two countries continued. A two-member Nalanda 
   Dance Troupe from India participated in the 10th Spring Friendship Art 
   Festival of the DPRK. 
    
   <br><br>The friendly and cordial ties between India and Mongolia were further 
   strengthened during the year under review. 
    
  <br><br> In what was the highest level delegation from India since the State 
   visit of President of India in July 1988, the Vice President of India 
   paid an official goodwill visit to Mongolia from 17 to 20 April 1992. 
   The highlight of this visit was the signing of an agreement on economic 
   and technical cooperation which provides for scholarships to Mongolian 
   Government nominees in various fields, setting up of an Indian Technical 
   Centre in Mongolia and a centre for promotion of small-scale industries 
   in that country. The President of Mongolia has accepted an invitation to 
   visit India.

   <br><br>The visit of the Presidents of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan and 
   Turkmenistan to India during 1991-1992 had given an impetus to the 
   bilateral relations with these countries and these were further 
   consolidated during the current year. Ambassadors of India were 
   accredited at the newly-opened Embassies in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) and 
   Alma Ata (Kazakhstan). A decision was taken to open an Embassy in 
   Dushanbe (Tajikistan) but could not be implemented on account of the 
   outbreak of disturbances. 
    
   <br><br>An Uzbek Parliamentary delegation led by Mr S M Yuldashev, Chairman of 
   the Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan, visited India in August 1992.

   each to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and US $ 5 million each to Kyrghyzstan 
   and Turkmenistan. 
    
   <br><br>The Deputy Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan, Mr Boris Shikhmuradov, 
   visited India from I to 9 December 1992. Besides having official 
   discussions, he also met members of the Indian business community. 
    
   <br><br>Medicines worth Rupees one crore were sent to Turkmenistan as

   worth Rs 75 Lakhs were sent as assistance to the victims of the 
   earthquake. Indian participation at the 61 st Izmir International Trade 
   Fair was a success with only 7 companies contracting business worth US $ 
   6.5 million as compared to 22 companies who had bagged orders worth US $ 
   3 million the previous year. The Lord Mayor of Ankara, Mr Murat 
   Karayalcin, visited Delhi from 8 to 10 December 1992 under ICCR's

   <tr class="evenRow"><td>DURING THE PERIOD UNDER REVIEW, INDIA'S RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES 
   OF West Asia and North Africa continued to be marked by friendship and 
   cooperation. Besides bilateral interaction, India coordinated positions 
   with some countries in the region in the world fora including UN, NAM 
   and G-15 on the international issues of common concern. India noted with 
   appreciation the understanding and confidence shown by several Arab 
   countries of WANA region at Government's handling of the Ayodhya issue. 
   India together with several countries in the region found common cause 
   in combating terrorism and religious extremism. Exchange of visits and 
   foreign office consultations helped in consolidating ties during this 
   period. 
    
   <br><br>Following the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and 
   Israel, India is looking forward to developing relations with Israel in 
   mutually beneficial fields while continuing to advocate its support for 
   the ongoing peace process which it is hoped will lead to a settlement 
   acceptable to all the concerned parties, and taking into account the 
   legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people both within 
   and outside the occupied territories. 
    
   <br><br>India was invited to participate in the multilateral phase of the Middle 
   East Peace Process comprising five Working Groups set up to discuss 
   regional issues of common concern viz Arms Control and Regional 
   Security, Environment, Economic Cooperation and Development, Water 
   Resources and Refugees. India, China and Japan are so far the only non- 
   regional Asian countries participating in the Middle East Peace Process. 
   Two meetings each of the Working Groups were held between May and 
   November 1992 and India participated in all of them. India made 
   presentations in respect of its experience in the related areas. These 
   were well received and it is hoped that some of these may prove to be 
   relevant enough to be taken up for greater consideration subsequently. 
    
   <br><br>There were continued high level contacts between India and Algeria. The 
   Algerian Minister of Transport visited India from 28 April to 2 May 1992 
   and was received by Prime Minister. Discussions inter alia focussed on 
   the need for greater cooperation in the railway sector, especially in 
   Algeria's development programmes. Prime Minister and Mr Radhe Malek, 
   member of 
    
    
   the High Committee of State of Algeria shared common perceptions on the 
   challenges of religious extremism faced by both the countries when they 
   met on 21 November at Dakar during the G-15 Summit. In August 1992, 
   Secretary level discussions between two foreign offices took place in 
   Algiers focussing mainly on pending bilateral issues including the 
   convening of the next meeting of the Joint Commission and issues 
   relating to the NAM Summit. 
   <br>-43&gt; 
   <br><br>An Exim Bank Line of Credit of US $ 50 million for Algeria has been 
   extended upto May 1993, for the purpose of providing Algeria the means 
   to surpass previous levels of imports from India. 
    
   <br><br>A delegation led by Deputy Minister of Commerce visited Egypt on 17 and 
   18 May 1992 to re-emphasise necessity of boosting bilateral trade 
   between the two countries. Foreign office consultations at Secretary 
   level took place in Cairo in August. The Egyptian Foreign Minister 
   agreed to assist in satisfactorily resolving the issue of outstanding 
   payments from Egypt of over Rs 80 million pending since the termination 
   of Rupee trade agreement. Meanwhile, ECGC credits amounting to Rs 105.21 
   million have been recovered. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister met President Hosni Mubarak at G-15 Summit at Dakar in 
   November. He reiterated the outstanding invitation to President Mubarak 
   to visit India, and President Mubarak assured Prime Minister that he 
   would schedule a visit shortly. Both leaders while sharing views on the 
   progress of Middle East Peace Process felt that continuing of the 
   dialogue between the Arabs and Israel was a necessary pre-condition for 
   peace in the region. Both India and Egypt being founding members of NAM 
   agreed to devise means for strengthening the movement so that it could 
   adapt to newer challenges. 
    
   <br><br>India's first Ambassador to Israel presented his credentials on 28 
   October 1992 and the Israeli Ambassador to India on 26 November 1992. 
   Following the establishment of diplomatic relations, a number of visits 
   at the official level have been exchanged between Israel and India with 
   a view to exploring possibilities of bilateral cooperation. Some broad 
   areas of mutually beneficial cooperation have been identified, which 
   include agriculture, civil aviation, tourism, culture, science and 
   technology, and solar energy. 
    
  <br><br> The fifth session of the Indo-Jordan Trade and Economic Committee was 
   held in Amman from 20 to 23 April 1992 during which status of trade and 
   economic relations between the two countries was reviewed. Both sides 
   were satisfied with the results of the efforts made by each side to 
   increase the volume of trade between the two countries. It was also 
   agreed that further markets would be explored by conducting surveys and 
   that Jordan would advise government 
   -44&gt; 
    
   departments to buy scientific equipments from India. India agreed to 
   maintain import of rock phosphate at the 1991-92 level, the import of 
   which has been decanalised. Jordan showed its eagerness to import from 
   India wheat, rice, barley and corn. A review of the ITEC programme was 
   also made. 
   <br>-44&gt;  
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   visited Jordan on 23 and 24 August 1992. The Jordanians suggested 
   founding of an Indo-Arab thought forum and a commission of wise men for 
   Asian Ethos. An invitation to Crown Prince Hassan Bin Talal to visit 
   India was extended by the Minister. 
    
   <br><br>India supports the full implementation of the Taif Accord in letter and 
   spirit, and welcomed the first Parliamentary elections which took place 
   in Lebanon after a gap of 20 years. India supports the Lebanese people 
   and Government in their commitment to national reconciliation, unity and 
   sovereignty, and the expansion of the authority of the Lebanese 
   Government and the Lebanese Armed Forces throughout the country in 
   accordance with the provisions of the Taif Agreement. 
    
   <br><br>The major issue with Libya during the year was the attempt to recover 
   Indian blocked funds owed to Indian companies. Some progress was 
   achieved. An amount of about Rs 1350 million has been paid back to the 
   Indian companies through oil payments in 1992, and further discussions 
   are in progress. Libyan Minister of Economic Planning, Mr Omer Mustafa 
   Muntassar, visited India as Col Gaddafi's special envoy on 13 August 
   1992 and called on the Prime Minister. He briefed about steps taken by 
   Libya to comply with UN Security Council Resolutions, and sought India's 
   understanding in finding an amicable solution to the problems arising 
   out of the Lockerbie air crash case. UN sanctions against Libya 
   continued till the end of the year. 
    
   <br><br>For logistical reasons, concurrent accreditation to Mauritania was 
   changed from Indian Embassy in Dakar (Senegal) to Indian Embassy in 
   Algiers (Algeria). 
    
  <br><br> Moroccan Foreign Minister, Mr Abdul Latif Filali, visited India from 18 
   to 23 February 1992. During his meetings with the Prime Minister and 
   other leaders, discussions focussed on the Moroccan proposal to upgrade 
   the Indo-Moroccan joint Committee, the Middle East Peace Process and 
   developments relating to the Arab Maghreb Union. 
    
  <br><br> India's sympathy and support to the Palestinian people were reiterated 
   by Prime Minister when he met President Yasser Arafat during his one day 
   
    
   stopover in Tunis on 20 November 1992 on his way to Dakar to attend the 
   G-15 Summit. President Yasser Arafat briefed Prime Minister on progress 
   in the Middle East Peace Process, especially in the Israel-Palestinian 
   dialogue. Solidarity with the Palestinian people was expressed at a 
   function organized by the ICCR to commemorate the International Day of 
   Solidarity. The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri 
   Eduardo Faleiro, who was the Chief Guest, reiterated India's consistent 
   and unequivocal support to the Palestinian cause. India regretted the 
   expulsion by Israel of more than 400 Palestinians from the occupied 
   territories and urged Israel to rescind the expulsion order. India as 
   President of the Security Council was instrumental in having UN Security 
   Council Resolution No 799 of 18 December passed, which inter alia 
   condemned Israel for the expulsions. 
    <br>-45&gt;
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   visited Somalia on 16 November and handed over relief supplies worth Rs 
   20 lakhs in the form of medicines and baby food for the affected people 
   of Somalia. A cheque for US $ 250,000 from the AFRICA Fund was also 
   handed over. The Minister of State availed of the opportunity to obtain 
   a first hand view of the prevailing chaotic situation in Somalia. He 
   held discussions with Mr Ali Mahdi and Gen Aidid including the prospects 
   of convening of a National Reconciliation Conference at a future date. 
   India supported the UN Security Council Resolution 794 inviting member 
   countries to contribute forces for the peace-keeping operations for 
   bringing about relief to millions of starving Somalis. In pursuance of 
   this Resolution, India also agreed to participate in the UN Peace 
   Keeping Operation in Somalia with one Corvette and one LST and 
   approximately with a brigade, including Paramedical units, from the 
   Indian Navy and Army respectively. 
    
   <br><br>During the current year, the Sudanese have shown a positive inclination 
   to further boost the bilateral relations and to cooperate in the 
   international domain with India. A very muted Sudanese reaction on the 
   events in Ayodhya was expressed. Discussions took place to recover 
   blocked funds amounting to Rs 62.58 crores though no significant 
   progress has yet been noted. 
    
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   visited Syria from 20 to 23 August 1992 with a view to rejuvenate 
   political contacts and to, impart greater economic thrust to bilateral 
   relations. He was accompanied by a business delegation. An exchange of 
   views took place on local and regional issues including the Middle East 
   Peace Process and the NAM Summit. He called on President Assad and Dr 
   Yassin, Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, who expressed a 
   desire to visit India at the 
    
    
   head of a business delegation. Syria showed keenness in developing 
   bilateral economic ties and assured the Minister of State that Syria 
   would welcome the participation by Indian companies especially in the 
   supply of machines, plants, equipments as well as infrastructure turn- 
   key projects. 
   <br>-46&gt; 
   <br><br>The second session of the Indo-Syrian Joint Trade Committee was held in 
   Delhi from 20 to 22 May. The Syrian delegation was led by Dr Abdul Rahim 
   Subeih, Deputy Minister for Planning. Discussions on ways and means to 
   develop diversified trade relations including barter were held. 
   Cooperation in the field of irrigation and agriculture, possibilities of 
   setting up industrial projects, further Indian participation in 
   transport, communication and power sectors were discussed. The Syrians 
   expressed desire to enhance scientific and technical cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>A 9-member Syrian Parliamentary delegation, headed by the Speaker of the 
   Syrian People's Council, visited India from 8 to 17 February 1993. The 
   members of the delegation called on the President, the Vice President, 
   the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the External Affairs 
   Minister and the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Salman 
   Khursheed during their stay. Wide ranging discussions on bilateral and 
   international matters took place. The Syrian side expressed its desire 
   to further strengthen the already existing friendly relations, India 
   reiterated her stand on the Palestinian question and hoped for an early 
   resumption of the Peace Talks. India also expressed dismay at the 
   deportation of 400 Palestinians by Israel. 
    
   <br><br>Tunisian Foreign Minister, Mr Habib Ben Yahia, visited India from 26 to 
   28 August 1992. He called on the President and the Prime Minister and 
   held talks with the objective of continuing regular political 
   consultations between the two countries. Discussions focussed on the 
   Middle East Peace Process and the NAM Summit at Jakarta. 
   <br><br> 
   The fifth meeting of the Indo-Tunisian joint Committee was held in New 
   Delhi from 26 to 28 October 1992. It was agreed to organize a multi- 
   sector exhibition of Indian products in Tunisia in 1993, explore 
   possibilities of maritime cooperation, joint ventures in industry and 
   tourism and the setting up of a Joint Chamber of Commerce. 
    
   <br><br>On his way to Dakar to attend G-15 Summit, the Prime Minister stopped in 
   Tunis on 20 November. Tunisian Prime Minister, Mr Hamid Karoui, briefed 
   Prime Minister on developments in the region with special reference to 
   Libya, Western Sahara, and Middle East Peace Process. The potential of 
   further expansion of commercial and economic cooperation was underlined 
   during 
    
    
   the discussions in view of the process of liberalisation underway in 
   both the countries. 
  <br>-47&gt; 
   <br><br>India's ties with the countries of the Gulf Region are as old as the 
   recorded history, and she has close relations with the countries of the 
   Region in almost every field. The presence of more than 1.5 million 
   Indian citizens working in the Gulf countries has added a major new 
   dimension to the bilateral relationship. Before the Gulf war, the annual 
   remittances from Indian nationals in the region were estimated to be Rs 
   3,500 crores. Since the end of the Gulf war, 1,09,000 Indian nationals 
   have already returned to Kuwait and more are expected to follow. The 
   remittances are expected to register growth. 
    
   <br><br>India has signed term contracts for import of 10 million tonnes of oil 
   from Gulf Cooperation Council Countries for the year 1992-93. In 
   addition, substantial purchases of crude oil from this region were also 
   made through the spot market. The Gulf countries account for 
   approximately two-thirds of India's oil import. 
    
   <br><br>India's total trade with the Gulf Region during the year 1991-92 was 
   approximately Rs 11,546 crores, of which about Rs 3,218 crores was the 
   value of her exports. The trade would increase even further when the 
   economic sanctions against Iraq are lifted. 
    
   <br><br>The security, stability and peace in this area of strategic importance 
   is of vital interest to India and she has high stakes in their promotion 
   in this region. It has, therefore, been India's constant endeavour to 
   further strengthen her ties with all the countries of this area. 
    
   <br><br>As a part of these efforts, the Minister for External Affairs 
   accompanied by a high level official and a business delegation, visited 
   Kuwait in February 1992. A bilateral co-operation agreement providing 
   for establishment of an Indo-Kuwait joint Commission was signed during 
   the visit. India also had the opportunity of welcoming the Kuwaiti 
   Ministers of Communication and Information who visited India in February 
   and July 1992 respectively. A Memorandum of Understanding on bilateral 
   cooperation in the field of information was signed during the visit of 
   the Information Minister. These visits and intensified bilateral 
   contacts have enabled the return of more than 1,09,000 Indians to Kuwait 
   upto the end of November 1992. 
    
   <br><br>The UAE President, Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahayan, paid a State 
   visit to India in April 1992 and held detailed discussions on matters of 
   mutual interest with the Prime Minister. Both sides agreed to expand the 
   scope of the 
    
    
   bilateral relationship. An agreement on the avoidance of double taxation 
   was signed during the visit. As a result of the visit the UAE has shown 
   increased interest in investments in India. As follow up measures, a UAE 
   delegation visited India to explore possibilities of setting up a 
   hospital and discussions have also taken place in UAE for investments in 
   the oil, petrochemicals and other sectors. Further discussions on these 
   subjects are to take place.<br>-48&gt;

<tr><td>After lying dormant for nearly two decades, the issue of sovereignty 
   over Abu Musa Island in the Southern Gulf was revived afresh between the 
   United Arab Emirates and Iran. Although the two sides have held 
   discussions on this issue, the dispute has defied resolution. In a 
   statement issued on 16 September 1992, India expressed the hope that the 
   existing differences would be resolved through friendly' bilateral 
   dialogue between the countries concerned in accordance with the 
   agreements. India, consistent with basic principles governing her 
   foreign policy, reiterated her respect for the sovereignty and 
   territorial integrity of all States in the Gulf region. India attached 
   importance to the maintenance of peace, stability and security in the 
   region. 
    
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   visited Baharain, Oman and Qatar in May-June 1992. During his visit, 
   Shri Faleiro held extensive discussions with the leaders of these 
   countries with a view to explore the possibilities of further expanding 
   the scope of bilateral relationship. The Secretary General of the GCC, 
   Mr Abdullah Bishara, visited India and held discussions with the Indian 
   leadership aimed at forging stronger and political ties with all the GCC 
   States. It has been decided to hold regular dialogue with the GCC 
   Secretariat. He also interacted with a broad strata of Indian academic 
   and media personalities. The six GCC States are Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, 
   Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. 
    
   <br><br>The Under Secretary for Political Affairs of Oman, Sayyid Haitham Bin 
   Tariq Al Said, visited India in September 1992 for discussions with the 
   officials of the Ministry of External Affairs. It was agreed to conclude 
   a new agreement on economic and technical cooperation with a view to 
   expand economic and commercial ties. Oman also expressed interest in 
   cooperation in the field of agriculture. In order to achieve these 
   objectives, India extended an invitation to the Omani Minister of 
   Commerce while Oman welcomed the visit by Indian Minister of 
   Agriculture. A delegation led by the President of Oman Oil Company 
   visited India in November 1992 to explore possibilities of cooperation 
   in the oil and petrochemicals sectors and several discussions have been 
   initiated on this subject. 
   <br>-49&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Defence, Shri 
   Krishna Kumar, visited UAE in October 1992. He called on the President 
   of the UAE and had detailed discussions with his UAE counterpart. He 
   also met a wide cross-section of the Indian community there. 
    
   <br><br>The Deputy Minister for Information of Saudi Arabia visited India in 
   February 1992 at the invitation of the Government of India, and 
   Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs visited Saudi 
   Arabia and the UAE in October 1992. Secretary (West) held official level 
   talks with his counterpart in the Foreign Ministry at Jeddah. 
    
   <br><br>India, through her pragmatic approach, contributed to the development of 
   consensus and endorsement of international law &amp; legitimacy in the UN 
   Security Council in 1992 on various resolutions pertaining to the Gulf 
   Region. India continued her efforts to get compensation for Indian 
   citizens and commercial establishements which suffered losses as a 
   result of the Gulf war. 
    
   <br><br>A Special Kuwait Cell was established in 1991 to deal with the 
   compensation claims of Indian nationals, including Indian companies, who 
   sustained losses during the Gulf crisis following Iraq's invasion and 
   occupation of Kuwait in August 1990. More than sixty thousand claims for 
   about US $ 733.8 million (about Rs 1,935 crores) have already been 
   forwarded (as on 16 February 1993) to the United Nations Compensation 
   Commission, Geneva. 
    
   <br><br>The UN Security Council vide its Resolution No 687 (1991) dated 3 April 
   1991 reaffirmed that Iraq, without prejudice to the debts and 
   obligations of Iraq arising prior to 2 August 1990, which will be 
   addressed through the normal mechanisms, is liable under international 
   law for any direct loss, damage, including environmental damage, and the 
   depletion of natural resources or injury to foreign governments, 
   nationals or corporations, as a result of Iraq's unlawful invasion and 
   occupation of Kuwait. The Security Council, under the same Resolution, 
   set up a fund to pay compensation for claims that fall within the above 
   parameters and also established a UN Compensation Commission (UNCC) to 
   administer the fund. 
    
   <br><br>There were about 1,72,000 Indian nationals in Kuwait before Iraq's 
   invasion. Even before the UNCC prescribed guidelines and formats for 
   presenting the claims, Government of India considered it desirable to 
   collect information on compensation claims from Indian nationals and 
   business houses, in a suitable format which was widely circulated as 
   early as in June 1991. The Special Kuwait Cell received about 95,000 
   claims which were registered and computerised. But this exercise became 
   infructuous as later the UNCC devised its own formats for claim 
   applications. 
   <br>-50&gt; 
    
   <br><br>In June 1992, the UNCC circulated rules/procedures for filing 
   compensation claims, Six types of forms for submission of claims, 
   namely, 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' &amp; 'F' have been prescribed by the UNCC. 
   These forms were given publicity, through news media, State and Union 
   Territory Governments, etc and fresh claim applications were invited as 
   per UNCC requirements. The first four categories pertain to claims by 
   individuals which are required to be forwarded to the UNCC by 30 June 
   1993. The claims for business losses are to be subimitted on form 'E' 
   and government claims on form 'F'. The last date for submission of 'E' &amp; 
   'F' claims is 31 December 1993. 
    
   <br><br>The total amount of compensation claimed by Indian nationals/companies 
   has not yet been finally compiled as claims are still being received, 
   but it is estimated that the total claim amount will be about US $ 2,000 
   million. 
    
   <br><br>The details of the Claim Forms are as follows: 
    
   <br><br>Form 'A':      Damages arising out of departure from Iraq or Kuwait by 
   affected individuals/families for fixed amounts between US $ 2,500 to US 
   $ 8,000 
    
   <br>Form 'B': Damages for serious personal injury or death 
    
  <br> Form 'C':      Individual claims for damages up to US $ 100,000 
    
   <br>Form 'D': Individual claims for damages above US $ 100,000 
    
   <br>Form 'E':      Claims of Corporations and other entities 
    
   <br>Form 'F':      Claims of governments and international organizations. 
    
   <br><br>So far 1,52,000 'A' claims have been registered with the Special Kuwait 
   Cell. Of these about 20% claimants appear to have made more than one 
   application. After eliminating such duplicate claims, there will be 
   about 1,20,000 genuine 
   claims. All these claims are being computerised by the National 
   Informatics Centre and are under various stages of processing. Upto 16 
   February 1993, 66,121 claims of 'A' category for a total amount of US $ 
   259,921,000 have been 
   sent to the Permanent Mission of India, Geneva, for onward transmission 
   to the UNCC. It is proposed to send all remaining 'A' claims to Geneva, 
   for onward transmission to the UNCC by April 1993. 
    
   <br><br>A total of 325 claims tinder category 'B' have been ed, registered and 
   scrutinised. Of these only 37 claims for US $ 92,500 have been found to 
   conform to the UNCC requirements and have been forwarded to the PMI, 
   Geneva. Letters have been issued to the rest of the claimants requesting 
   them 
    
    
   to remove the deficiencies. It is hoped that their replies will be 
   received by the middle of March 1993 and thereafter, the remaining 'B' 
   forms will be forwarded to the UNCC. 
   <br>-51&gt; 
  <br><br> Claims under Category 'C' are expected to be around 20,000. Majority of 
   these claim forms have not been filled in correctly. The claim forms are 
   being scrutinized and the claimants will bp notified to remove the 
   deficiencies. 
    
   <br><br>The total number of claims received and registered under Category 'D' so 
   far is 326. Scrutiny of these claims has been completed and letters have 
   been issued to the claimants to remove deficiencies as per the UNCC 
   requirements and resubmit the claims by March 1993. 
    
   <br><br>So far, 118 claims from the Companies, Corporations, etc have been 
   received. Very few claims have been submitted in the UNCC form 'E'. Even 
   these have not been correctly filled in and supported with documentary 
   evidence. Letters are being sent to the concerned to meet the UNCC 
   requirements. Even though the last date of submission of claims in form 
   'E' is 31 December 1993, it is proposed to forward the forms to Geneva 
   in the first half of 1993. One 'E' claim for US $ 472.8 million has 
   alredy been lodged with the UNCC. 
    
   <br><br>As regards government claims to be submitted in form 7, the concerned 
   authorities have been advised to submit their claims in time. 
    
   <br><br>The tensions between Iraq and coalition partners resurfaced during 
   December 1992- January 1993. The two sides were at variance with respect 
   to a number of issues, including border demarcation between Iraq and 
   Kuwait, 'no fly zones' and access to the search teams from UN Special 
   Commission. These differences resulted in a series of military actions 
   by USA, UK and France against Iraqi targets. On 14 January 1993 a 
   statement by India hoped that dangerous escalations would be avoided by 
   strict adherence to the terms of the ceasefire after the Gulf war and by 
   full recognition and observance of the sovereignty, integrity and 
   international legitimacy of all States in the Gulf region. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry assisted in arrangements for Haj Pilgrimage and 24,000 
   Hajis performed the Haj in June 1992 under the auspices of the Haj 
   Committee. 4,700 travelled by sea and 19,300 by air. A twelve member Haj 
   Goodwill Delegation led by Shri Khurshid Alam Khan, Governor of 
   Karnataka, visited Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage and carried a letter 
   from Prime Minister to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. 
  <br>-52&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The unfortunate incident that took place in Ayodhya on 6 December had 
   its repercussions in the countries of the Gulf region. Most of the Gulf 
   countries and inter-regional groupings such as Gulf Cooperation Council 
   and the Organization of Islamic Conference issued critical statements 
   condemning the incident and the communal riots that took place in the 
   wake of the destruction of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya. The Government made 
   every effort to explain developments in the correct perspective to the 
   friendly countries. The Ambassadors of GCC countries as well as OIC were 
   briefed by the Minister of State as well as the Secretaries in the 
   Ministry of External Affairs. Indian Envoys in the Arab capitals also 
   made efforts to explain the developments. It is assessed that as a 
   result of these efforts, the countries by and large appreciate India's 
   commitment to secular ideals and the sincerity with which the Government 
   is trying to find appropriate solutions to this intensely complex 
   problem. 
    
   <br><br>India has traditionally attached importance to the relations with Iran. 
   Iran has assumed special significance for India against the backdrop of 
   the situation in the Gulf, developments in Central Asia and Afghanistan 
   and in the region as a whole. Iran's large reserves of oil and gas, its 
   status as a major power in the region and its impulses on issues of 
   growth and development are factors conducive to cooperation of great 
   mutual benefit and advantage. 
    
   <br><br>Iran too pays substantial attention to relations with India. Frequent 
   high level exchanges have characterised the bilateral relations. Iranian 
   Foreign Minister, Dr Velayati, visited India for the Sixth Session of 
   the Indo-Iranian Joint Commission on 10 and 11 November 1992. During the 
   Joint Commission Session, Iran conveyed firm signals of its readiness to 
   upgrade political, economic and commercial realtions with India. Apart 
   from three existing committees dealing with trade, industry, cultural 
   and consular matters, etc, two new committees were set up in the Joint 
   Commission to handle new thrust areas of agriculture and transportation. 
   There was progress in specific areas of cooperation. Indian proposals 
   for participation in projects in Iran are also in various stages of 
   finalisation.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>THE DEMOCRATIC WAVE ACROSS THE VAST AFRICAN CONTINENT HAS RESULTED IN 
   profound changes. Some countries made progress towards multi-party 
   democracy, in other countries the transformation has been slow, and in 
   some there has actually been regression. The reform process in South 
   Africa received a setback due to continuing violence specially after the 
   initial optimism over the successful meeting of the Convention for a 
   Democratic South Africa (CODESA-I). It is hoped that the political 
   deadlock at CODESA-II over the formation of a representative government 
   was only temporary. 
    
   <br><br>India has welcomed the growing acceptance of multi-party democracy in 
   Africa. There was a smooth transition in Zambia to multi-party 
   democracy. Kenya and Tanzania have carried out the necessary 
   constitutional amendments for registration of various political parties. 
   The first multi-party election in 26 years was held in Kenya on 29 
   December 1992. Two distinguished Indians were part of the Commonwealth 
   Observers Team in Kenya. Seychelles elected a Constitution Commission in 
   July 1992. However, as the draft Constitution submitted for referendum 
   in November 1992 could not muster the requisite minimum percentage of 
   votes (60%), the Constitution Commission is being reconvened in January 
   1993 to draw up a fresh constitution. In Madagascar, the new 
   constitution was approved in a referendum held in August. In Guinea and 
   Mali multi-party elections were completed and new Governments came into 
   power during the course of the year, In Gambia President Jawara was re- 
   elected. In Zaire a transitional government was elected in August 1992 
   and has been charged with a mandate to organize multi-party elections 
   within a period of 2 years. In Ghana Presidential elections were 
   completed in November 1992. Ft Lt J J Rawlings was elected as the 
   civilian President and installed on 7 January 1993. Parliamentary 
   elections took place on 29 December 1992 with the opposition parties 
   boycotting them. In Nigeria the democratic process received a setback 
   due to widespread complaints of irregularities. The Presidential 
   elections originally scheduled to take place in December 1992 have been 
   postponed to June 1993. Mozambique, after signing a General Peace 
   Agreement on 4 October 1992, is moving towards establishment of a multi- 
   party system. Angola conducted 
    
    
   <br><br>elections in September 1992. The ruling MPLA party won the elections but 
   there will be a run-off between President Dos Santos and UNITA leader Mr 
   Jonas Savimbi as neither got the required percentage. Thus significant 
   changes are being effected in sub-Sahara Africa. 
   <br>-54&gt; 
   <br><br>Economically the continent continues to suffer, its problems being 
   compounded by a severe drought in Southern Africa. Most of the countries 
   have accepted the structural adjustment programme of the IMF as a major 
   means of their economic recovery even though the conditionalities 
   involve a lot of sacrifices. There was a trend towards greater regional 
   cooperation. Therefore, economic groupings like Economic Community of 
   West African States (ECOWAS) in West Africa, Southern African 
   Development Community (SADC) in Southern Africa, Preferential Trade Area 
   (PTA) covering Eastern, Central and Southern African countries or the 
   Indian Ocean Commission are expected to play a greater role. Then, there 
   is the African Economic Community which is the ultimate aim of the OAU. 
    
   <br><br>India has always attached special importance to its relations with 
   Africa. With the political independence of all African countries and the 
   prospect of reform within South Africa, the struggle against colonialism 
   and institutionalised racialism is moving towards a successful 
   conclusion. In the future, new relationships based on concrete economic, 
   technological and educational cooperation will assume enhanced 
   significance. It is increasingly being realised that in several areas 
   Indian technology is more relevant to the needs of Africa than that 
   provided by the developed countries. India has initiated economic 
   collaboration arrangements with several countries of Africa. The focus 
   of Indian cooperation would now shift more to consultancy services, 
   projects, joint ventures and investments in various fields besides 
   promoting India's exports to Africa. Despite constraints of resources on 
   both sides, Indian efforts would be to embark on mutually beneficial 
   projects. The countries of Africa seek Indian assistance for their human 
   resource development. In this sphere India is in a position to assist; a 
   large number of Indian scientists and technical experts are already 
   working in Africa. 
    
  <br><br> While expressing regret at the continuing violence in South Africa, 
   India worked assiduously in various international fora to promote the 
   restoration of the process of negotiations for bringing about a non- 
   racial, democratic and undivided South Africa. She has welcomed the 
   resumption of negotiations between the African National Congress (ANC) 
   and the South African Government. The next multi-party constitutional 
   negotiations are likely to be resumed in February 1993. 
   <br>-55&gt; 
    
   <br><br>In view of the positive developments towards the formation of an interim 
   Government of national unity, India announced the decision to set up a 
   Cultural Centre in South Africa at a suitable location to promote 
   "people to people" contacts, with power to discharge necessary visa 
   functions. This is in consonance with the decision taken at the 
   Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held at Harare in 1991. 
   India also decided to commence direct air links with South Africa. In 
   accordance with the CHOGM time-table, diplomatic relations with South 
   Africa will need to await the establishment of an interim Government. 
   <br><br> 
   India continued to give moral and material support to the ANC to end 
   apartheid in South Africa. Sixteen ANC diplomats are being trained in 
   the Foreign Service Training Institute. Other proposals for human 
   resource development are also in the pipeline. 
    
   <br><br>The highlight of India's relations with Mauritius was the visit by Prime 
   Minister, Shri P V Narasimha Rao, in March 1992 as Chief Guest for the 
   celebrations declaring Mauritius a Republic. This was followed by the 
   visit of Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo, First President and former Governor 
   General of Mauritius, in May-June. The Mauritian Foreign Minister, Mr 
   Paul Raymond Berenger, also visited India from 5 to 12 August 1992. 
   These and other high level visits resulted in a further consolidation of 
   the existing close ties between the two countries. 
    
  <br><br> In the elections held in Angola on 30 September and 1 October 1992 the 
   ruling Popular Movement for the liberation of Angola (MPLA) was declared 
   the winner having polled 53.74% votes while National Union for the Total 
   Independence of Angola (UNITA) could muster only 34.1%. 
    
   <br><br>A second round of presidential polls is to take place as neither 
   candidate could obtain more than 50% of the votes. The UN continue to 
   make efforts to bring about a political dialogue between the two sides. 
   India hopes that agreement is reached and peace prevails in Angola. 
    
   <br><br>A General Peace Accord was signed on 4 October 1992 between the 
   President of Mozambique, Mr Chissano, and the RENAMO leader, Mr Afonso 
   Dhlakama, in Rome. The two leaders expressed their interest and 
   willingness to make every effort for a lasting peace in Mozambique. A 
   United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) has been established. 
   The UN Force is to act in conformity with the Peace Accord in ensuring 
   peace, ceasefire and holding of elections. India has been requested to 
   provide logistic companies for ONUMOZ. The Mozambican Foreign Minister, 
   Dr Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi, paid an 
    
    
   official visit to India from 25 to 27 August 1992. Mozambique would like 
   India to play an active role in the reconstruction of its economy, 
   particularly in the field of agriculture, transport, communication, 
   mines and industry. 
   <br>-56&gt; 
   <br><br>India and Uganda have longstanding relations except for the aberration 
   during Idi Amin's regime from 1972-76. President of Uganda, Mr Yoweri 
   Kaguta Museveni, paid a State visit to India from 12 to 14 October 1992. 
   The visit provided a fillip to the bilateral relations and the two 
   countries can now move forward to forging a constructive relationship 
   based on mutual benefit. Uganda is seeking India's assistance in various 
   fields for the reconstruction of its economy. Some areas of cooperation 
   have been identified like setting up food processing industry, wood 
   products, manufacture of bicycles, edible oils and fertiliser. A 
   Framework Agreement was also signed to sort out the problem of blocked 
   funds in Uganda. 
    
   <br><br>The then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, 
   paid a visit to Ethiopia from 9 to 17 November 1992. This was the first 
   Ministerial visit to Ethiopia in 15 years. The Transitional Government 
   of Ethiopia, since it assumed power in May 1991, has been undertaking 
   major political, economic and social changes in the country. India's 
   assistance to Ethiopia's economic development was appreciated. The 
   Ethiopian leadership, has expressed the hope that India would assist 
   them further in their economic development. The Foreign Minister of 
   Ethiopia led a high-level economic delegation to India from 14 to 16 
   December 1992. They have sought Indian cooperation in rural technology 
   particularly agro-industries, small scale industries and technical 
   assistance, specially in higher education. They are also seeking Indian 
   investment. 
    
   <br><br>Sierra Leone witnessed a coup d'etat in April 1992. The President, Mr 
   Joseph Momoh, fled the country. Captain Valentine Strasser took over as 
   President at the head of a military ruling council. Another coup attempt 
   on 28 December 1992 failed. 
    
  <br><br>In Ghana, the Parliamentary elections for 200 constituencies were held 
   on 29 December 1992. With many opposition parties boycotting the 
   elections, the National Democratic Congress Party of President Rawlings 
   won the elections securing 189 seats. 
    
   <br><br>The civil war in Liberia continued, bringing untold misery to the 
   people. Intermittent fighting continued throughout the year, 
   intensifying in the latter half of the year. At least 3,000 casualties 
   were reported. The West African Peace Keeping Force, ECOMOG, continued 
   its efforts to bring the fighting to 
   
    
   an end. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Summit 
   held in Abuja in November 1992 decided to impose economic sanctions on 
   warring factions not complying with the Yamoussoukro-IV agreement. The 
   UN Security Council passed a resolution to impose arms embargo on 
   Liberia, excepting ECOMOG. The UN Secretary General appointed a Special 
   Representative to evaluate the situation and report to the Security 
   Council. All necessary efforts were made to assist Indians in Liberia. 
   <br>-57&gt; 
   <br><br>President Eyadema of Togo dissolved the Government led by Prime Minister 
   Joseph Koffigoh on 13 January 1993 for "failing to organize elections on 
   schedule" thereby 11 putting the continuity of the state in peril". He 
   stated that a new Prime Minister would be appointed to head a government 
   of national unity which would be charged with the task of organizing in 
   the shortest possible period, free democratic and fair elections. 
    
   <br><br>Mr James A Michel, Chief of Staff of the Seychelles Peoples Defence 
   Forces and Minister of Finance and Information of the Republic of 
   Secychelles visited India from 12 to 17 October 1992 at the invitation 
   of Minister of State for Defence and discussed matters relating to 
   bilateral defence cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>The Government of India was deeply concerned over the adverse effects of 
   the unprecedented drought prevailing in Southern Africa and the 
   consequent distress among the people of the region. Despite her severe 
   economic constraints, India sent relief assistance comprising medicines, 
   baby food and water purification tablets to some of the more severely 
   affected countries like Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, 
   Zambia and Zimbabwe as well as some countries further. up north like 
   Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia. While this was a modest contribution, it was 
   symbolic of the concern that the people of India felt for the people of 
   the countries of Africa. 
    
   <br><br>During the year under review, India continued to play a significant role 
   as Chairman of the Action For Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and 
   Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund which was set up by the 8th NAM Summit in Harare 
   in September 1986 as an expression of the Movement's support and 
   solidarity with the Frontline States. The mandate of the AFRICA Fund was 
   renewed by the 9th NAM Summit in Belgrade in 1989 till the 10th NAM 
   Summit. The 10th meeting of the Senior Officials of the AFRICA Fund 
   Committee in Cairo in May 1992 reviewed the outcome of all the various 
   initiatives taken by the Fund. The Prime Minister as Chairman of the 
   AFRICA Fund Committee made a statement on the AFRICA Fund to the 10th 
   NAM Summit in Jakarta in September 1992. In his presentation, the Prime 
   Minister endorsed the recommendations of the AFRICA Fund Committee that 
   while the mandate of 
    
    
   the Fund ends at the 10th Summit, the member states of the Movement 
   would continue to support the liberation movements in South Africa till 
   the objective of bringing about a non-racial unified and democratic 
   South Africa is achieved. The 10th NAM Summit commended the role played 
   by India as Chairman, and the Committee member countries and expressed 
   its appreciation and gratitude to all donor countries for their generous 
   contributions. The Summit also accepted the proposal of the Chairman, 
   Prime Minister of India, to provide US $ 250,000 for the humanitarian 
   relief in Somalia and the remaining balance to the Southern Africa 
   Development Community (SADC) for drought relief in Southern Africa, 
   human resource development in South Africa and voter education there 
   before the elections. The Summit further recommended that while the 
   mandate of the Fund ends at the Summit, member countries of the Movement 
   should Continue to strengthen the liberation movements in South Africa 
   with fresh expressions of political and material support. 
   <br>-58&gt; 
   <br><br>India on her part, as a contributor to the Fund, continued to make 
   efforts for full utilisation of its contribution of Rs 50 crores in kind 
   and of the contribution of Rs 2.56 crores by individuals, private and 
   public organizations in India. Further, in accordance with the decision 
   of the 10th NAM Summit, a cheque for US $ 250,000 was given to the UN 
   Special Representative in Somalia by the then Minister of State for 
   External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, in Mogadishu in November 1992. 
   Shri Eduardo Faleiro in January 1993 presented another cheque for US $ 
   290,000 to SADC for utilisation in accordance with NAM's decision. 
    
   <br><br>The activities of the AFRICA Fund have been greatly appreciated- by the 
   Frontline States and the liberation movements and have earned all round 
   recognition. Its experience has set an example in South-South 
   cooperation and collective solidarity. It was India's privilege to be 
   associated with this effort both as a contributor to the Fund and its 
   Chairman.

<tr><td>A. OVERALL TRENDS 
    
   THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS IN 1991-92 HAD 
   indicated the sweeping changes that had affected the erstwhile USSR and 
   continued to take place in the countries of Eastern Europe. The changes 
   that have taken place and are continuing in Eastern Europe and the 
   former Soviet Union are expected to have a major impact on international 
   relations. The process of reformulation of international relations and 
   the building of new international structures has begun. Developments in 
   the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will have a 
   very important bearing on the evolution of this new order. 
    
   <br><br>The changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union 
   are not only of a political dimension but also embrace far-reaching 
   economic reforms with the objective of closer integration into the 
   international economic system and efforts to firmly establish a 
   pluralist form of democracy although the pace and content in respect of 
   these activities varies from country to country. These processes, taking 
   place simultaneously, have given rise to a plethora of problems within 
   these countries and also those which have an external dimension 
   including, inter alia, the rise of ethnic nationalism, migration of 
   populations, a re-orientation of the Trans-Atlantic and European 
   security structures, multiplicity of political parties and movements and 
   self-doubt about several aspects of the change including the likelihood 
   of substantial economic recovery in an acceptably reasonable time-frame. 
    
   <br><br>India has welcomed the advent of democracy and a pluralist form of 
   Government in the East European countries. India has also welcomed the 
   efforts being made by these countries to re-model their economic 
   structures to integrate them into the international economic system 
   based on market principles. At the same time, it is India's belief that 
   the political and economic changes in these countries provide the 
   framework for even closer, mutually beneficial political, economic, 
   commercial, scientific and other forms of cooperation. The changes in 
   these countries have brought them ideologically 
    
    
   more in line with India's own non-ideological orientation and democratic 
   beliefs. They also provide opportunities for India, particularly in 
   economic terms. 
  <br>-60&gt; 
  <br><br> Several steps were taken to consolidate India's traditionally friendly, 
   cooperative and mutually beneficial relations with the independent 
   Republics that emerged from the former Soviet Union. These included high 
   level political interchanges. Diplomatic relations have been established 
   with all the Republics that emerged from the former Soviet Union. 
   India's diplomatic presence has been expanded. Indian Embassies are now 
   functioning in Kiev and Minsk and Consulates General in Vladivostok and 
   St. Petersburg. India's relations with these countries are being 
   reconstructed on new lines. The expectation, however, is that India's 
   relations with all the successor States would stabilise. India had very 
   good relations with the former Soviet Union and it is the intention that 
   these relations will endure with the successor Republics. 
    
   <br><br>Efforts are being made and would be pursued to maintain the close 
   political relations that India had previously enjoyed with the East 
   European countries. The economic dimension of the relationship has 
   necessarily to take into account the changes not only in these countries 
   but also the on-going changes in India. 
    
   <br><br>Following the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of 
   Yugoslavia, India had on 11 May 1992 extended recognition to the 
   Republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and the Indian 
   Embassy in Belgrade continued to be accredited to the newly formed 
   Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In respect of Macedonia, taking all 
   relevant factors into account, India has not accorded recognition. 
    
   <br><br>The on-going crisis in the former Yugoslavia is a matter of serious 
   concern and anxiety. India is grieved at the loss of innocent lives and 
   the economic and social distress that has resulted from the crisis. 
   India's approach to the crisis has from the very inception been based on 
   principle. She welcomes all efforts to bring about an immediate peaceful 
   settlement and stress the need for an early political resolution without 
   resort to any form of force or violence. 
    
  <br><br> As a gesture of solidarity, India has decided to contribute humanitarian 
   relief amounting to Rs 1 million for the former Yugoslavia. The amount 
   is to be used to purchase medicines, etc, through the Indian Red Cross 
   for use by the ICRC. 
    
   <br><br>The year also saw the peaceful and constitutional division of the Czech 
   and Slovak Federal Republic with effect from 1 January 1993. India has 
   recognised 
    
    
   both the new Republics that have emerged, viz the Czech Republic and the 
   Slovak Republic. Diplomatic relations continue, without break, with both 
   these countries. India's Ambassador in Prague has been appointed as the 
   first resident Ambassador to the Czech Republic and the first non- 
   resident Ambassador to the Slovak Republic. The Embassy of the CSFR in 
   New Delhi has been divided into two portions. Both countries have 
   diplomatic representation in India on a continuing basis. 
   <br>-61&gt; 
   <br><br>B. DESCRIPTIVE PART 
    
   <br><br>The emergence of Russia as an independent State, together with the 
   process of democratisation and economic reforms entailed certain 
   adjustments in bilateral relations on both sides. While the process 
   involved some transitional difficulties mainly in economic interaction, 
   both countries are aware of the continued convergence of interests and 
   the new opportunities that have opened up for the further development of 
   mutually beneficial cooperation in the new context. 
    
  <br><br> High level political and official contacts with Russia underlined the 
   importance both countries attach to the bilateral relationship. Prime 
   Minister, Shri P V Narasimha Rao, and President Yeltsin have since their 
   January 1992 meeting kept in touch including through exchange of letters 
   and President Yeltsin paid an official visit to India in late January 
   1993. President and Prime Minister have been invited to visit Russia. 
    
   <br><br>Former State Secretary, Mr Gennady Burbulis, visited India in May 1992 
   at the invitation of Finance Minister. He was accompanied by Ministers 
   of Foreign Economic Relations, Economy, and Fuel and Energy and State 
   Counsellor for Conversion of Defence Industry. He called on the 
   President, Vice President and Prime Minister and held discussions with 
   Raksha Mantri and Ministers of State for External Affairs, Commerce and 
   Power. An agreement establishing an Indo-Russian joint Commission and 
   another agreement on trade and economic cooperation were signed during 
   the visit. 
    
   <br><br>The high point of Parliamentary contacts between Russia and India was 
   the visit of a Russian Parliamentary delegation led by the Supreme 
   Soviet Chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, to India in August 1992. Apart 
   from discussions with the Honourable Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Deputy 
   Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and Members of Parliament, Speaker 
   Khasbulatov also called on the President and the Prime Minister. He 
   spoke warmly of the historical legacy of Indo-Russian relations and the 
   need to sustain and deepen them. 
   <br>-62&gt; 
   <br><br> 
   Raksha Mantri, Shri Sharad Pawar, paid an official visit to Moscow in 
   September 1992. Substantive discussions were held with acting Prime 
   Minister, Mr Gaidar, and Defence Minister, Gen Grachev, apart from other 
   Russian dignitaries. Raksha Mantri discussed with his host bilateral and 
   international security issues and continuing military-technical 
   cooperation between India and Russia. The Chiefs of the Air and Naval 
   Staff of the Indian Armed Forces also paid goodwill visits to Russia in 
   October and November 1992 respectively. 
    
  <br><br> President Yeltsin visited India from 27 to 29 January 1993. He was 
   accompanied by the first Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr 
   Shumeiko, Foreign Minister, Defence Minister, Minister of Security and 
   Minister of External Economic Relations, among others. President Yeltsin 
   had meetings with the President and Prime Minister. The Ministers 
   accompanying him had separate bilateral discussions. 
    
   <br><br>During the visit of President Yeltsin, a treaty of friendship and 
   cooperation and agreements on Rupee-Rouble exchange rate, on defence 
   cooperation, on Indo-Russian consultations, on cultural and scientific 
   cooperation, on information, on combating illicit traffic in narcotics 
   and on cooperation between the Ministry of Home Affairs of India and the 
   Russian Security Ministry, and an MOU on science and technology were 
   signed. Four letters were also exchanged on trade and related matters. 
    
   <br><br>The visit laid a durable foundation for future friendship and close 
   interaction between India and the Russian Federation. President Yeltsin 
   indicated Russia's desire to build a dynamic growth-oriented multi- 
   faceted relationship with India and stated that a friendly and stable 
   relationship between two big Asian powers like Russia and India will 
   contribute to the cause of regional stability and peace. The convergence 
   of views on issues of mutual interest and common concern would enable 
   fruitful and purposeful cooperation between the two countries both 
   bilaterally and in the multilateral context. In effect, following 
   President Yeltsin's visit a new chapter has opened in Indo-Russian 
   relations - a chapter that takes into account the changed global context 
   as also the changes that have taken place in both the countries. 
    
   <br><br>India and Russia have cooperated fruitfully in international 
   organizations including the UN. India supported the UN General Assembly 
   resolution (based on the joint Russo-Afghan Declaration of 14 May 1992) 
   appealing to the Governments of Afghanistan and Russia to start talks on 
   the humanitarian question of the return and accounting of POWs and MIAs. 
   <br>-63&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The first meeting of the Indo-Russian joint Commission is expected to be 
   held in the near future. 
   <br><br> 
   Three important issues merit mention in relations with the Ukraine. The 
   most important is the rapid development of bilateral relations, starting 
   with the visit in January 1992 of a team of Secretaries, including 
   Foreign Secretary, which laid the foundation for further high-level 
   contacts and establishment of diplomatic relations. Foreign Secretary 
   was received by President Kravchuk, who expressed his keenness to 
   continue the close relations that existed between the former USSR and 
   India. 
    
   <br><br>President Kravchuk subsequently visited India in March 1992 during which 
   four important agreements were signed. Prime Minister and President 
   Kravchuk signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation on 27 March 
   1992 which was subsequently ratified and Instruments of Ratification 
   were exchanged in November 1992 in Kiev. The other agreements were : (i) 
   Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation; (ii) Agreement on 
   cooperation in fields of Science and Technology; and (iii) Agreement on 
   Cooperation in the spheres of Culture, Arts, Education, Tourism, Sports 
   and Mass Media. 
    
   <br><br>In October 1992, Raksha Mantri, Shri Sharad Pawar, visited Kiev, during 
   which he had meetings with President Kravchuk, Defence Minister Morozov, 
   Foreign Minister Zlenko and Minister for Heavy Industry and Conversion 
   Antonov. This visit served to continue the high-level dialogue between 
   the two countries and determined the method of payments settlements to 
   be used in selected sectors of trade between the two countries. 
    
   <br><br>The Indian Embassy was opened in Kiev on 7 May 1992, the first among the 
   new CIS Republics. Since then, the Ambassador has joined and more 
   officials are expected to join shortly. The Ukrainian Embassy in Delhi 
   is due to open shortly and their Ambassador has been chosen. 
    
   <br><br>A number of draft agreements were exchanged and official level visits 
   have also taken place, aimed principally at working out the details of 
   the agreements and understandings reached at the political level. A 
   number of public sector and private business persons have visited Kiev 
   and other important cities. In this connection, the Indian Exhibition 
   organized by Indian Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO) in Kiev in 
   September 1992 gave Ukrainian officials and the emerging private sector 
   a comprehensive idea of the potential of India as a trade partner. 
   Earlier, in August, the Indo-CIS Chamber of Commerce had organized a 
   successful exhibition in Kiev. 
<br>-64&gt; 
    
   <br><br>After recognizing the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of 
   Belarus in December 1991, Protocols establishing diplomatic and consular 
   relations at Resident Mission level were signed on 17 April 1992 at 
   Minsk. A new Embassy of India in Minsk was opened on 14 May 1992 and is 
   functional since then. Prime Minister has invited Chairman of the 
   Supreme Soviet of Belarus and Chairman of the Council of Ministers to 
   visit India and the timing of these visits is under discussion. To 
   maintain and expand traditional bonds of friendship and cooperation with 
   Belarus a number of agreements on political, economic, commercial, 
   cultural, science and technology cooperation, etc are at various stages 
   of negotiation. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister met the Presidents of all the three Baltic Republics at 
   Rio de Janeiro on 13 June 1992. He recalled that India had established 
   diplomatic relations with all the three Republics and, in due course, 
   would open Missions in their capitals. 
    
   <br><br>The process of interchange, in particular in the commercial and cultural 
   sectors, has been initiated. Proposals of technical assistance under the 
   ITEC programme are also under consideration. 
    
   <br><br> with Armenia, Georgia and Moldova in the commercial and 
   cultural sectors as also in the matter of technical assistance under 
   ITEC have been initiated. The President of Moldova is expected to visit 
   India during 1993. 
    
   <br><br>Relations with Hungary continued to develop with a series of working 
   level visits. Official consultations on foreign policy were held in 
   Budapest in October during the visit of Secretary (West), Shri K 
   Srinivasan. The Science and Technical Cooperation Agreement was renewed 
   for a further period of five years in December 1992 when the Hungarian 
   Minister without portfolio, Prof Erno Pungor visited India. A bilateral 
   agreement on tourism was signed earlier in October between Secretary 
   (Tourism) and the visiting Hungarian Chairman of the Tourism Board, Mr 
   Kazmir Kardos. On the cultural side, the State Secretary for Culture, Mr 
   Elemer Biszterszky visited India in February 1992 and following his 
   discussions with Secretary (Culture), the two sides agreed on an 
   implementation plan for the Cultural Exchange Programme which had been 
   renewed the previous year. 
    
   <br><br>The trade picture during the year reflected both the opportunities and 
   challenges resulting from the changes in the economic and commercial 
   field in the two countries. Keeping in mind the growing importance of 
   consumer goods in India's exports to Hungary, India was selected as the 
   Chief Guest 
   -65&gt; 
    
   for the Budapest International Autumn Trade Fair. The Indian 
   participation at the Europa'92 Telecommunication Exhibition in Budapest 
   was also in high profile. In the field of joint ventures and 
   collaborations, efforts were underway on both sides to take advantage of 
   economic liberalisation programmes in India. 
<br>-65&gt; 
   <br><br>Important Indian visitors to Hungary during the year were the Chairman 
   of Atomic Energy Commission, the Chairman of the Indian Trade Promotion 
   Organization, Chairman of the Telecommunications Commission, the 
   Maharashtra Minister of Industries and a delegation from the Ministry of 
   Industry to study the labour situation in Hungary. 
    
   <br><br>1992 was also an active year for cultural activities. The 100th death 
   anniversary of the famous Hungarian Indologist Alexander Choma de Korosi 
   was commemorated by a series of events both in India and Hungary. Among 
   them was the dedication of a stupa by His Holiness Dalai Lama during his 
   visit to Budapest. Noted artistes like sitarist Shahid Parvez Khan and 
   the Kathak group led by Rohini Bhate visited Hungary and the Hungarian 
   Choral Quintet performed in several cities in India. 
    
  <br><br> At the political level, preparations are underway for a meeting of the 
   Indo-Hungarian Joint Commission. A Parliamentary delegation from Hungary 
   led by the Speaker is expected to visit India in the summer of 1993. The 
   State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr Janos Martonyi, is also expected 
   in India to continue the practice of regular bilateral official 
   consultations. High level state visits to and from Hungary are also 
   under consideration for 1993. 
    
  <br><br> Poland continued its march towards marketisation of its industry, trade, 
   commerce and economic structures in spite of certain hardships in 
   transition and maintained the on-going process of integration with 
   European institutions. 
    
   Following the privatisation of foreign trade in Poland and the changes 
   in economic policies in both countries, the process of direct contact 
   between Indian and newly emerging Polish businessmen accelerated during 
   the year. 
    
   <br><br>Consultations at the level of Foreign Ministries of both countries were 
   held in Warsaw in October 1992. Secretary (West) and Under Secretary of 
   State of Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs led their teams. It was 
   found that a basis for further strengthening of Indo-Polish relations 
   continues to exist. 
    
  <br><br> A Polish Parliamentary delegation led by the Chairman of the Sejm 
   visited India in December 1992 at the invitation of the Indian 
   Parliament. The visit permitted an extensive and frank exchange of views 
   between Indian 
   -66&gt; 
    
   parliamentarians and freely elected Polish parliamentarians. The 
   delegation also called on the President and the Vice President. 
<br>-66&gt; 
   <br><br>It is anticipated that President Walesa will pay a visit to India in 
   1993. It is expected that in early 1993 an agreement on cooperation in 
   the field of science and technology, a programme of cooperation for 
   1993-94 in the field of science and technology and a cultural exchange 
   programme between India and Poland would be signed. 
    
   <br><br>India's relations with the Czech &amp; Slovak Federal Republic continue to 
   be close and friendly despite its preoccupation since June 1992 with the 
   impending break-up into two independent States, Czech Republic and 
   Slovakia on 31 December 1992. 
    
   <br><br>The 45th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between 
   India and CSFR was marked by exchange of messages in November 1992 at 
   the Foreign Minister/Minister of State level. The death in November 1992 
   of Alexander Dubcek, the hero of the 1968 'Prague Spring' movement was 
   condoled. Prime Minister sent a special message of condolence. 
    
   <br><br>The six day visit of the Slovak Minister for International Relations to 
   India in April 1992 preceded by two weeks President Havel's transit 
   through New Delhi. During his visit to Prague in October 1992, Shri K 
   Srinivasan, Secretary (West), had bilateral talks with the Federal First 
   Deputy Foreign Minister. 
    
   <br><br>A reference has already been made above to India's recognition of the 
   two new States that have emerged from the division of the CSFR. Prime 
   Minister sent messages of congratulations to both the Prime Ministers of 
   the Czech and Slovak Republics in which he recalled, inter alia, the 
   tradition of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation in the 
   commercial, economic, scientific, defence, cultural and other spheres. 
   He also conveyed that Government of India would endeavour to strengthen 
   this tradition with both the Czech and Slovak Republics for mutual 
   benefit. Trade Agreements with both the new Republics, providing for 
   commerce in convertible currency, are being negotiated.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri R L Bhatia, paid an 
   official visit to Poland on 9 and 10 February, Slovak Republic from 11 
   to 13 February, Czech Republic from 14 to 16 February and Hungary on 17 
   and 18 February 1993. Besides meeting with the Foreign Ministers in 
   these countries and discussing bilateral matters and issues of common 
   concern, he called on the Heads of State or Government. The purpose of 
   the visit was to maintain the close 
    
    
   political, economic and defence relations that India enjoys with these 
   countries and to study ways for developing new relationships in the 
   light of far-reaching changes taking place in these countries. 
   <br>-67&gt; 
   <br><br>The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officially passed into 
   history on 27 April 1992 with the adoption by the SFRY Parliament of the 
   Constitution of the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia comprising Serbia 
   and Montenegro. Elections to the new FRY Parliament were held on 31 May 
   1992. The Parliament approved Dr Dobrica Cosic as the first President of 
   the FRY and Milan Panic as its first Prime Minister. Subsequently, a 
   further round of elections were held on 20 December 1992 in the FRY for 
   various posts. In the meanwhile, the UN had adopted comprehensive 
   mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia on 30 May 1992. These sanctions 
   were further intensified in November 1992. The sanctions were imposed 
   for alleged involvement of Serbia in the continuing war in Bosnia- 
   Herzegovina and for non-cooperation by Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
   in UNPAs. The situation in Kosovo in the Republic of Serbia continued to 
   be tense with total non-cooperation by the ethnic Albanians with the 
   Federal and Serbian authorities. Long term CSCE Missions were sent to 
   Serbian provinces of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandzak. 
    
   <br><br>After recognition by the EC and a large number of countries, after 15 
   January, Croatia was admitted as a UN member in May 1992. Elections were 
   held in Croatia on 2 August. President Franjo Tudjman was re-elected and 
   the ruling Croatian Democratic Union Party was once again elected to 
   power. Barring the situation in the UNPAs and the Pink Zones, the 
   situation in Croatia returned rapidly to normal. 
    
   <br><br>Slovenia was admitted to the UN in May 1992. It had also been recognized 
   by a large number of countries after 15 January 1992. Elections were 
   held in Slovenia on 6 December 1992. President Milan Kucan was re- 
   elected and the Liberal Democratic Party emerged as the single largest 
   party in Parliament. The situation in Slovenia was stable throughout the 
   year. 
    
   <br><br>Following Greek protests over the use of the name Macedonia, the EC and 
   most other nations in the region withheld their recognition. Macedonia 
   was recognized only by nine countries. To overcome the problem of 
   recognition, Macedonia decided to seek admission into the UN. A decision 
   by the UN is awaited. Due to the growth of tension in Macedonia, the 
   Security Council approved the deployment of UNPKF along Macedonia's 
   borders with both Serbia and Albania as a preventive measure. 
  <br>-68&gt; 
    
  <br><br> The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina continued to pre-occupy the 
   attention of the international community throughout the year. The 
   recognition of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government by the EC and a large 
   section of the international community saw civil war break out in the 
   Republic due to the objection to international recognition by the Serbs 
   in that Republic. The cost of this civil war has been considerable in 
   terms of damage to men and material and loss of human lives. The UN 
   Protection Force was deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina in August 1992 and a 
   large number of UN Resolutions adopted related to the situation in this 
   Republic, especially with the humanitarian aspects of peace-keeping and 
   on no-fly zone. 
    
  <br><br> The EC Conference on Yugoslavia was transformed into a larger 
   International Conference on Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), with the active 
   involvement of the UN, based in Geneva, with two British and American 
   Co-Chairmen representing the UN Secretary General. 
    
   <br><br>The Security Council passed twenty Resolutions on the former Yugoslavia 
   from April to December 1992. These were in addition to the six 
   Resolutions adopted in 1991-92. The Resolutions, inter alia, related to 
   deployment of UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Macedonia; 
   sanctions against Yugoslavia; the situation in UNPAs and Pink Zones in 
   Croatia; conveying humanitarian assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina; 
   monitoring of airports and declaration of no-fly zone over Bosnia- 
   Herzegovina; detention camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina; violation of human 
   rights; war crimes and also that relating to Yugoslavia's membership in 
   the UN. The General Assembly passed two Resolutions on the situation in 
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and one on Yugoslavia's membership. 
    
   <br><br>India abstained on 3 Resolutions of the Security Council and 2 
   Resolutions of the General Assembly. The overall Force Commander of UN 
   Forces in former Yugoslavia is a serving Indian Army officer, Lt Gen 
   Satish Nambiar. 
    
   <br><br>Besides the UN and EC, other international organizations which debated 
   the situation on Yugoslavia, included the CSCE, the G-7, the OIC, NATO, 
   WEU and NAM. Yugoslavia's membership of several organizations, including 
   the UN, NAM and G-15 was placed in suspense. 
    
   <br><br>Yugoslavia was Chairman of NAM during the conflict with in it. The NCB 
   Meeting in Bali and the NAM Summit in Jakarta devoted sometime over the 
   situation in Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia handed over the Chairmanship of NAM 
   to Indonesia on the eve of the Summit through a letter at the 
    
    
   Ministerial Meeting. Croatia was admitted as an Observer in NAM and 
   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia as Guests. Macedonia showed an interest 
   to join the movement. 
   <br>-69&gt;
   <br><br>India and Bulgaria continued to maintain traditionally close and 
   friendly relations in the political and cultural fields. In the cultural 
   field, several Indian Professors visited Bulgaria and a Kathak dance 
   troupe led by Rohini Bhate participated in the Bourgas International 
   Dance Festival and gave performances in Sofia and Veliko Turnovo. 
   Secretary (Culture), Ministry of Human Resource Development, visited 
   Bulgaria at the invitation of the Minister of Culture of Bulgaria to 
   review Indo-Bulgarian cultural relations. 
    
   <br><br>Bulgaria's first post-1945 non-communist Government led by Prime 
   Minister Filip Dimitrov's Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) having 110 
   seats of 240 lost the confidence of the National Assembly in November 
   1992 when the 24-member ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
   (MRF) withdrew its support. After the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
   was unable to select an acceptable candidate for Prime Minister, the MRF 
   nominated, Prof Lyuben Berov, Economic Adviser to the President, who 
   with the support of BSP received on 30 December the Assembly's approval 
   for a new non-party Cabinet. 
    
   <br><br>Indo-Romanian ties continued to develop. The holding of elections in 
   Romania in October 1992 contributed to the growth of pluralist democracy 
   in that country. 
    
   <br><br>Secretary (West) visited Bucharest in August 1992 for Foreign Office 
   consultations and it is expected that a Parliamentary delegation from 
   India will visit Romania during 1993. 
    
  <br><br> A draft Cultural Exchange Programme is presently under discussions and 
   once signed would lead to closer people to people contact. 
    
   <br><br>The Rupee clearing arrangement which was to end on 31 December 1992 has 
   been extended till 31 March 1993 after which it is expected that all 
   commercial transactions would be in freely convertible currencies. An 
   Indo-Romanian Chamber of Commerce was set up in India in October and the 
   Romanian side. have indicated that they will set up a similar body soon 
   in Romania. 
    
   <br><br>A Civil Aviation Agreement was signed with Romania in August 1992 in New 
   Delhi which allows for three Romanian Airlines flights per week to India 
   and vice versa.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>During the year, India's initiatives on forging closer relations with 
   countries in Western Europe were given sharper focus. Government took 
   into account impending changes across the European continent in light of 
   the Maastricht Treaty which aims at economic, monetary and political 
   union of the EC member countries, as well as the entering into effect of 
   a Single European Market by January 1993. 
    
<br><br>The Annual Indo-EC Troika-level talks were held in Delhi in March 1992. 
   The Foreign Ministers of Portugal, UK and the Netherlands visited India 
   for the talks. The Troika Foreign Ministers reassured India that the 
   current preoccupations of the European Community with developments in 
   Central and Eastern Europe and the Republics of the former Soviet Union 
   should not be seen as a disinclination of their interest in the 
   developing world, especially India. A new framework cooperation 
   agreement between India and the EC was initialled in December 1992, 
   which recognizes India as a major partner and paves the way for 
   expansion and diversification of Indo-EC cooperation in the fields of 
   trade, investment, technological and scientific exchanges, and cultural 
   cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>Substantial progress was made during the year in intensifying the 
   already close relations with the UK. The groundwork was laid during the 
   visit of the British Foreign Secretary in January 1992, when it was 
   agreed that a regular bilateral dialogue would be maintained at various 
   levels and would also be institutionalised between the two Foreign 
   Offices. Pursuant to this decision, a number of high-level visits were 
   exchanged during the year. The visit of the Prince of Wales to India in 
   February 1992 was yet another milestone in the growing friendly 
   relations between India and the UK. 
    
   <br><br>On 22 September 1992, India and the UK signed an Extradition Treaty and 
   an Agreement concerning the Investigation and Prosecution of Crime and 
   the Tracing, Restraint and Confiscation of the Proceeds and Instruments 
   of Crime (including crime involving currency transfers) and Terrorist 
   Funds. These two agreements were of historic and pathbreaking importance 
   and strengthened the commitment of both countries to work together in 
   combating terrorism. The Agreements are expected to become effective in 
   early 1993 after completion of ratification procedures. 
    
   <br><br>British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, visited India from 23 to 28 
   January 1993. He was the first British Prime Minister to be invited 
   since Independence to be Chief Guest on the Republic Day. His visit 
   marked the culmination of a 
    
    
   process of high level exchanges initiated in January 1992 and symbolised 
   the maturity of Indo-British relations which now stand firmly placed in 
   a modern, forward-looking context. Mr Major was accompanied by a high 
   level business delegation. The British Prime Minister reaffirmed the 
   UK's commitment to close cooperation with India in combating terrorism. 
   He also expressed support for India's secular and democratic traditions 
   as well as economic reforms. The visit of Mr Major provided a strong 
   impetus to bilateral trade as well as investment and joint ventures, 
   availing of the opportunities opened up by India's economic 
   liberalisation programme. 
    <br>-71&gt;
   <br><br>India has traditionally enjoyed close relations with France, to which we 
   attach importance in both the European and the global contexts. Prime 
   Minister's official visit to France from 28 to 30 September 1992 served 
   to consolidate these relations. Both sides confirmed their desire to 
   impart new dimensions and depth to bilateral relations, in particular in 
   the areas of investment, technology and trade. In order to build on the 
   impetus provided by Prime Minister's visit, a number of Ministerial 
   visits were exchanged with France and a regular dialogue at the level of 
   Foreign Secretaries was also institutionalised. 
    
   <br><br>The Festival of India in Germany, which concluded in July 1992, was 
   widely acknowledged as a great success and played an important role in 
   bringing the peoples of India and Germany closer together. The first 
   meeting of the Indo-German Consultative Group, set up by the Prime 
   Minister and the German Chancellor, was held in Bonn on 16 September 
   1992. This Group recommended a number of measures for strengthening 
   bilateral cooperation in various fields. Actions were initiated to 
   implement these recommendations. German Chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, 
   visited India from 18 to 22 February 1993. The Jawaharlal Nehru Award 
   for International Understanding was conferred upon him on 19 February 
   1993. This Award symbolised not only the high esteem in which the 
   Chancellor is held in India for his personal contributions to the cause 
   of world peace and development, but also the cordiality and closeness of 
   bilateral relations to which both countries attach great importance. 
    
  <br><br> Germany is already India's leading partner in Western Europe in terms of 
   trade, investment and technology transfer, aid and S &amp; T cooperation. 
   The German Chancellor's visit provided an opportunity to further 
   consolidate these relations. During the year, a number of Ministerial 
   visits were also exchanged between India and Germany and a dialogue at 
   the level of Foreign Secretaries was initiated. 
   <br>-72&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The State visit of the President of Portugal to India from 26 January to 
   4 February 1992 marked a high point in Indo-Portuguese relations. Prime 
   Minister also paid a transit visit to Lisbon on 15 June 1992. Government 
   approved a Portuguese proposal for the setting up of a Consulate General 
   of Portugal in Goa. 
    
   <br><br>Prime Minister paid a transit visit to Madrid on 10 June 1992. The 
   Spanish Prime Minister paid an official visit to India from 7 to 10 
   February 1993 during which a number of important bilateral agreements 
   were concluded. Relations with Spain, particularly in the areas of trade 
   and economic relations, continued 'to expand. 
    
   <br><br>India's trade and economic relations with Italy also continued to grow. 
   The Bologna University in Italy organized a major Symposium on India 
   from 17 to 20 September 1992 to which a large number of scholars, 
   scientists and historians were invited. Government were represented at 
   the Symposium by Shri Madhavrao Scindia, the then Minister of Civil 
   Aviation and Tourism. 
    
   <br><br>The Austrian Minister for Economy, Mr Walter Schussel, visited India 
   from 13 to 18 October 1992. His visit coincided with that of an Austrian 
   business delegation, indicating the growing interest on both sides in 
   establishing joint ventures and collaborations taking advantage of the 
   favourable investment climate resulting from India's economic reforms. 
    
   <br><br>During the year, Foreign Secretary/Secretary level consultations between 
   Foreign Offices were also held with Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden. 
    
   <br><br>In addition to making concerted efforts to expand relations with West 
   European countries in the fields of trade, investment and technology 
   transfer, Indian Missions faced the challenging task of responding to 
   public concerns in Europe on areas ranging from human rights to the 
   environment. There was a growing tendency among certain countries of 
   Western Europe to lay emphasis on human rights issues and establish 
   linkages to developmental assistance. The projection of India's 
   commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law was vigorously 
   undertaken by Indian Missions, generally with a considerable measure of 
   success. 
    
   <br><br>As a result of India's active diplomacy, Governmental reactions on the 
   Ayodhya incident in most of the West European countries tended to be 
   favourable. Official Statements by the British Government and the EC 
   showed an understanding and support for Government's action to restore 
   calm and emphasise the continuity of the secular and democratic 
   traditions of India. 
   <br>-73&gt; 
    
<br><br>The European Parliament also passed a supportive and balanced resolution 
   on Ayodhya. Indian Missions continued to be engaged in the task of 
   ensuring that there were no setbacks as a result of the Ayodhya incident 
   to the growing relations between India and Western Europe in the 
   economic arena.

   INDIA HAS ALWAYS PURSUED FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, 
   BASED<br><br>
   on shared democratic values and traditions. The changes in the 
   international environment brought about by the end of the Cold War have 
   provided both the countries with an opportunity to re-evaluate bilateral 
   relations. The past year has been marked by increased diversification of 
   India's bilateral ties, an intensification in the pace of exchanges 
   between the two countries and greater political appreciation of each 
   other's perspectives on various issues, important differences in the 
   positions of the two countries on these issues notwithstanding. 
    
   <br><br>Important American personalities who visited India during the year 
   included Senators David Boren, Claiborne Pell, Carl Levin, Howard 
   Metzenbaum, Paul Simon, Daniel P Moynihan, Representative Jim McDermott 
   and Mr Kurt Schmoke, Mayor of Baltimore. From Indian side, Minister of 
   State for Commerce visited Chicago to participate in the COMDEX Spring 
   '92 Exhibition and Raksha Mantri undertook an official visit to the US. 
    
  <br><br> At the official level, there were visits by Ambassador Peter Burleigh, 
   Counter Terrorism Coordinator, Mr Melvyn Levitsky, Assistant Secretary 
   of State for International Narcotics Matters, Mr James Lilley, Assistant 
   Secretary of Defence, Ms Teresita Schaffer, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
   for Near East and South Asia, Mr Sichan Siv, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
   for South Asia, Mr R Grant Smith, Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
   International Narcotics Matters and Mr Vincent Decain, Assistant 
   Director of the US Arms Control &amp; Disarmament Agency. Important visits 
   at the official level from India to the US included those by Foreign 
   Secretary and Defence Secretary. 
    
  <br><br> The election of Mr Bill Clinton as the 42nd President of the United 
   States, and the induction of the Democratic Administration has opened 
   new vistas for enhancing relations with the United States. Although 
   President Clinton has not articulated his Administration's policies 
   towards India in any detail, he made several positive references to 
   India during the campaign. 
   <br>-75&gt; 
    
  <br><br> An MEA delegation which attended the second round of Indo-US bilateral 
   talks in Washington in November 1992 also visited the Democratic 
   campaign headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, to meet members of 
   President Clinton's Transition Team. This initiative, the first by any 
   foreign country since Mr Clinton's election, was designed to establish 
   initial contact with the new Administration. It is Government's 
   expectation that interaction with the new Administration will not only 
   consolidate the basic continuity, in Indo-US relations but help in 
   building a more meaningful and mature relationship based on mutual 
   understanding and trust. 
    
   <br><br>The US remained India's largest trading partner as well as the biggest 
   foreign investor in India. Total trade turnover during 1991-1992 was 
   around US $ 4.91 billion. India had a favourable balance of trade with 
   the US, with imports amounting to US $ 1.99 billion and exports US $ 
   2.92 billion. 
    
   <br><br>The US has welcomed the recent economic liberalisation measures taken by 
   India, has encouraged this process and supported India's request for 
   loans in multilateral financial institutions. US companies accounted for 
   nearly 30 per cent of all Indian joint ventures with foreign companies. 
   Investment from the US increased from Rs 344.8 million in 1990 to Rs 
   1858 million in 1991 and by 31 October 1992 had touched Rs 10073 
   million. 
    
   <br><br>The US-India Business Council and the Indo-US joint Business Council met 
   in a joint session on 7 and 8 December 1992 at the US Chamber of 
   Commerce in Washington. The JBC meeting discussed issues relating to 
   intellectual property rights, technology transfer, trade and environment 
   and financial services. 
    
<br><br>After some initial difficulties, subsidies under the US's Export 
   Enhancement Programme were also extended to India and India contracted 
   the purchase of 1.5 million metric tonnes of wheat from the US. 
    
   <br><br>The issue of protection of Intellectual Property Rights continued to 
   remain a major trade-related irritant in bilateral ties. High level 
   consultations have narrowed the gap on copyrights, trademarks and access 
   to US motion pictures, but differences continue to persist on patents, 
   especially in relation to food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. On 29 
   April 1992, the US withdrew GSP concessions on specified imports of 
   drugs and chemicals from India as a retaliatory measure. India has also 
   been redesignated a "priority foreign country" under the Special 301 
   provisions. India has expressed her disappointment and regret on this 
   unilateral move since these issues are under discussion at the Uruguay 
   Round of the GATT multilateral trade negotiations. 
  <br>-76&gt; 
    
   <br><br>High technology transfers from the US had emerged as an important facet 
   of bilateral interaction. The Cray XMP-14 Supercomputer at the National 
   Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting in New Delhi was upgraded to 
   a Cray XMP-216 under a bilateral agreement. However, due to increased 
   proliferation concerns heightened by the Gulf War, the US has of late 
   been more stringent in releasing dual-use high-technology items, 
   including spare-parts. Negotiations for a second Supercomputer for the 
   Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, did not fructify because of US 
   insistence on intrusive and restrictive security and end-use conditions. 
   The US attitude has adversely affected a number of Indian programmes, 
   particularly in the Department of Space. On 11 May 1992, the US 
   annuounced the imposition of a two year ban on American trade and 
   technology transfers with and to ISRO and Glavkosmos of Russia over a 
   deal for the supply of cryogenic rocket engines which the US regards as 
   being violative of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). 
    
   <br><br>On 16 June 1992, the US Department of Commerce amended Export 
   Administration Regulations by notifying a list of countries to which no 
   American Company can export any product without licence if it has reason 
   to believe that the product will be used for missile design, 
   development, production and use. The list includes India and 
   specifically mentions the Agni and Prithvi projects and the SLV, ASLV, 
   PSLV and GSLV programmes. India has conveyed her concern to the US to 
   name her civilian space programme in the notification as it has no 
   connection with her missile programme. The US policy of linking 
   technology transfers to nonproliferation objectives is a negative trend 
   in the bilateral ties. 
    
   <br><br>To enable a better appreciation of each other's perspectives, India has 
   initiated a bilateral dialogue with the US on disarmament, non- 
   proliferation and regional security issues. Two rounds of discussions 
   have been held so far, covering the entire range of global arms control 
   trends, regional security issues and initiatives, designed to promote 
   stability and confidence building. These talks have facilitated a better 
   understanding of each other's position. 
    
   <br><br>Human rights has become a priority issue for both the US Administration 
   and Congress. Pakistan-supported Kashmiri groups and proponents of 
   "Khalistan" have joined hands and have employed professional lobbyists 
   to intensify their propaganda compaign against India in the US. As a 
   result of this lobbying and the one-sided reports by international human 
   rights organizations, some US congressmen were influenced to introduce 
   anti-India bills relating to human rights. Attempts were also made to 
   cut the 
    
    
   meagre US developmental aid to India over alleged human rights 
   violations in Punjab and Kashmir, though eventually no bills or 
   amendments specifically targetting India were adopted. The US 
   Administration has also expressed concern, from time to time, about the 
   human rights situation in Kashmir and Punjab. At the same time the 
   Administration has showed an understanding of the extraordinary 
   situation in these two states created on account of cross-border 
   terrorism. The US Government has implicitly acknowledged Pakistan's 
   involvement in training and arming of terrorists in Kashmir and Punjab. 
   US officials have indicated to Indian officials that they have taken 
   this up strongly with Pakistan. The provisions of US law require a 
   determination to be made about countries sponsoring terrorism. This is 
   reported to be under consideration with respect to Pakistan. 
    <br><br>-77&gt;
   <br><br>Bilateral defence cooperation has been proceeding satisfactorily in a 
   structured manner, aided by frequent exchanges of high level visits. A 
   number of senior US military officers have visited India including 
   Admiral Kelso, US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Larson, CINCPAC, 
   Gen Sullivan, Chief of Staff, US Army, Lt General Corns, USARPAC, Vice 
   Admiral Arthur, former Commander of the Seventh Fleet, and his 
   successor, Vice Admiral Timothy Wright. 
    
   <br><br>Raksha Mantri visited the USA from 5 to 9 April 1992 at the invitation 
   of US Defence Secretary. The Chief of Naval Staff and Chief of Air Staff 
   also visited the US during 1992. Despite intensified defence 
   cooperation, procurement of defence items from the US is limited to 
   commercial purchases in small amounts. 
    
   <br><br>For the first time Indo-US Joint Naval exercises were held off the 
   Western seaboard on 29, May 1992. Four warships, two from each side, 
   participated in the 24 hour exercises. These exercises were held in the 
   wider context of India's desire to strengthen professional contacts 
   between the Indian Navy and navies of other friendly countries. The 
   Indian Army co-hosted the XVII Pacific Armies Management Seminar in 
   Delhi jointly with the US Army Pacific (USARPAC) in January 1993 within 
   the framework of Indo-US Army-to-Army cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>Under the aegis of the Indo-US Joint Commission, specific projects in 
   the agriculture and health sciences are underway. An important on-going 
   project is the Indo-US Vaccine Action Programme. Funding problems in the 
   future are anticipated because of the depletion in the corpus of the 
   United States India Rupee Fund (USIF-the PL-480 Funds) which will run 
   out by 1997. 
  <br>-78&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The budgetary situation in the US has led to a decline in dollar funding 
   of bilateral exchanges and projects. In science and technology 
   collaborative projects, the US has introduced issue of intellectual 
   property rights thereby hindering further intensification of cooperation 
   in an area long considered to be of mutual benefit. This has led to 
   projects being restricted to basic research rather than applied R &amp; D 
   which would involve sharing of IPR. 
    
   <br><br>A major aid package for population control in Uttar Pradesh has been 
   worked out for which around US $ 225 million will be made available by 
   USAID over a period of 10 years. 
    
   <br><br>India and the US have been cooperating fruitfully in the area of 
   narcotics control. 
    
   <br><br>Under an agreement signed on 25 September 1992, the US will provide $ 
   45,000 to the Narcotics Control Bureau for buying equipment which will 
   help in narcotics control at Bombay airport. 
    
   <br><br>Government accord high priority to the strengthening of Indo-US 
   relations within the framework of shared interests through a process of 
   dialogue. India's endeavour is to narrow differences where they exist 
   and expand cooperation in a substantive manner in areas of mutual 
   benefit. The overall ambience of Indo-US relations has improved 
   qualitatively although certain irritants in bilateral relations remain. 
   <br><br> 
   Founded on historical and shared ties of the Commonwealth, Indo-Canadian 
   relations have been traditionally friendly. 
    
   <br><br>Canada has welcomed India's new economic policies. There are at present 
   70 joint ventures and technical collaborations between India and Canada 
   in areas such as telecommunications, mining equipment and surface and 
   air transportation. More than half of these were finalised since the 
   initiation of the economic reforms programme. 
    
   <br><br>Canada has been supportive of India in multilateral financial 
   institutions. Canadian aid to India during 1992 amounted to 
   approximately C $ 100 million. Total bilateral trade for the year 1991- 
   92 was of the order of Rs 1070 crores. India's adverse balance of trade 
   with Canada was reduced from Rs 278 crores in 1990-91 to Rs 62 crores in 
   1991-92. Canadian exports to India in 1992-93 have registered a 
   substantial increase because of the purchase of wheat by India. 
    
   <br><br>The on-going operational cooperation between India and Canada to combat 
   terrorism and other criminal activities has been fruitful. 
   <br>-79&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The Vice President of India delivered the inaugural Lal Bahadur Shastri 
   Memorial Lecture to launch the silver jubilee celebrations of the 
   Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute (SICI) which has been instrumental in 
   promoting educational exchanges. 
    
  <br><br> A Canadian Parliamentary delegation, led by the Speaker of the House of 
   Commons, Mr John Fraser, visited India in January, 1993. The Rt Hon 
   Charles Joseph Clark, President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada 
   and Minister Responsible for Constitutional Affairs, visited India in 
   March, 1993 for high-level bilateral consultations.

<tr><td>During the period under review, India's relations with the Latin 
   American countries and the Caribbean witnessed a definite improvement. 
   Interactions at the highest political levels, conclusion of a number of 
   important bilateral agreements and a stream of visitors to India towards 
   the latter half of the year, were some indications of the renewed 
   intensity in India's relations with this important region of the world. 
    
   <br><br>The Prime Minister attended the UN Convention on Environment and 
   Development (UNCED), popularly called the 'Earth Summit' at Rio de 
   Janeiro, Brazil, from 3 to 14 June 1992. He was accompanied, amongst 
   others, by the Ministers of State for External Affairs and Environment &amp; 
   Forests. He had bilateral meetings with President F Collor of Brazil and 
   President Salinas of Mexico. 
    
   <br><br>During the NAM Summit from 1 to 6 September 1992 in Jakarta, Prime 
   Minister had a meeting with the Foreign Minister of Venezuela. Minister 
   of State for External Affairs, Shri R L Bhatia, had a meeting with the 
   Foreign Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, and the then Minister of State 
   for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, informally met the Foreign 
   Minister of Suriname, which holds an observer's status in the NAM. 
    
   <br><br>Shri Eduardo Falerio undertook a tour of three important Caribbean 
   countries, namely, Suriname from 19 to 22 September, Trinidad from 1 to 
   4 October and Jamaica from 5 to 7 October. This was the first bilateral 
   visit to the region since Vice President's visit in 1988. The tour 
   provided an opportunity to further strengthen and consolidate the 
   already strong historical and traditional links with these countries. A 
   genuine effort was made to harness the vast trade potential flowing from 
   a growing appreciation in these countries of India's achievements in 
   science and technology and other related fields. Besides having a 
   fruitful exchange of 
   
    
   views on various matters of mutual interest with the Governments of the 
   three countries, the visit enabled both the sides to identify areas for 
   mutual cooperation in trade, investment, culture, technical and economic 
   exchanges. It was decided to establish a Joint Commission between India 
   and Suriname. 
   <br>-80&gt; 
   <br><br>A delegation, led by former. President of the Federation of Indian 
   Export Organization (FIEO), undertook a trade promotion tour of Chile, 
   Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela from 5 to 18 July. This visit was a 
   follow up of the visit of a FIEO delegation which accompanied Prime 
   Minister to Caracas in November 1991 to participate in the parallel 
   meeting of Businessmen 'from the G-15 countries. This visit closely 
   followed on the heels of a visit by another high-level delegation from 
   the Associated Chambers of Commerce (ASSOCHAM) to Argentina, Brazil, 
   Chile and Mexico in May 1992. Both the delegations had the opportunity 
   to study the structural reforms and the new macro-economic policies 
   being followed by these countries in order to learn from their 
   experiences. 
    
   <br><br>The Cuban Government deeply appreciated India's decision to sell 10,000 
   tonnes of rice to them on credit. The decision was taken keeping in view 
   the policy of expanding trade with friendly countries in the region. 
   India also voted in favour of the resolution moved by Cuba in the UN 
   General Assembly on the US economic embargo against Cuba. 
    
   <br><br>In order to meet the cultural needs of the people of Indian origin which 
   constitute a major percentage of the total population in the Caribbean, 
   India decided to establish Cultural Centre in a permanent building in 
   Suriname. For this a plot of land has been given. The Cultural Centre 
   has been running since 1981. Cultural agreements were also signed with 
   the Governments of Suriname and Jamaica. 
    
  <br><br> Mr Maxmilliano Cox, a senior official in the Chilean Agricultural 
   Ministry, visited New Delhi on 7 and 8 October. In his meeting with the 
   Minister of State for Agriculture, promotion of exchanges in the fields 
   of agriculture and forestry between the two countries was discussed. 
    
   <br><br>Mr Harold Pollack, Minister of Natural Resources of Suriname, visited 
   India from 20 to 22 October. He held meetings with Minister of State for 
   External Affairs and Minister of state for Mines. Possibilities of 
   cooperation in the mining sector and of India assisting Suriname in 
   exploiting its water resources were discussed. 
    
   <br><br>To mark the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Columbus in America, the 
   Diplomatic Missions from the Latin American countries organized an 
   -81&gt; 
    
   exhibition-cum-seminar at the Centre of Spanish Studies, Jawaharlal 
   Nehru University. 
<br>-81&gt; 
  <br><br> The Adviser to President Dr Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, Mr Vikrarn Oditt, 
   called on the then Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo 
   Faleiro, and handed over a written message from his President addressed 
   to Prime Minister. The Adviser was in New Delhi also to attend a UNIDO- 
   sponsored Conference held in November 1992. During the visit, several 
   broad areas were identified for mutual cooperation. 
    
   <br><br>At the third G-15 Summit in Dakar, Senegal, held in November 1992, Prime 
   Minister had an opportunity again to interact with the leaders from the 
   Latin American and the Caribbean Countries who are members of the Group. 
    
   <br><br>As part of economy drive, after much deliberation, it was decided to 
   close down Indian Missions in Kingston and Bogota. Efforts would be made 
   to see that bilateral relations with these countries are not affected.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW MARKED A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE IN THE ACTIVITIES 
   OF the UN. A reinvigorating UN with a more sharply focussed agenda was 
   increasingly perceived as having moved to centrestage and as having 
   assumed an increasingly significant role in directly or indirectly 
   shaping events the world over. These ranged from the situation in 
   Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Middle East Peace 
   Process, the humanitarian crisis in Somalia to the United Nations 
   Transitional Authority on Cambodia (UNTAC) supervised settlement in 
   Cambodia, etc. In addition, the UN continued to medicate on issues 
   ranging from Central America and Cyprus to Mozambique and issues 
   relating to Commonwealth of Independent States. 
    
   <br><br>The UN also focussed on issues such as environment, human rights, 
   economic issues, drug abuse control, emergency humanitarian assistance 
   and the restructuring and revitalisation of the UN including the 
   question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership 
   of the Security Council. 
    
   <br><br>India's traditional commitment to multilateralism, as also her important 
   role in international affairs, were highlighted by her membership of the 
   Security Council, where India played an innovative, moderating and 
   pragmatic role on a whole range of issues. India's two-year term in the 
   Security Council came to an end on 31 December 1992. India held the 
   Presidency of the Council in December.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>The Security Council continued to monitor the follow up on decisions on 
   the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, compensation for 
   individuals and organizations which had suffered losses as a result of 
   the invasion of Kuwait and the demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary. 
   The Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission completed its work this 
   year. India joined other members of the Council in endorsing its work. 
    
   <br><br>India maintained her consistent position that while Iraq would have to 
   comply with the mandatory resolutions of the Security Council, the 
   Council 
    
    
   should give serious consideration to the possibility of relaxing the 
   sanctions regime in view of the humanitarian crisis. India also 
   supported Security Council Resolution 778 which permitted certain 
   categories of frozen Iraqi assets to be released to the UN for 
   humanitarian and compensation purposes. 
    <br>-83&gt;
   <br><br>The question of Palestine remained a major issue in 1992. India joined 
   two historic consensus resolutions adopted by the Security Council on 
   the forced deportation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories. 
   India maintained its consistent support for the peace process in West 
   Asia. India's Permanent Representative to the UN Shri C R Gharekhan was 
   appointed by the Secretary General as his Special Representative for 
   West Asia beginning 1993. This appointment has been welcomed by all the 
   States in the Middle East Peace Process. 
    
   <br><br>In 1992, the situation in the former Yugoslavia was the focus of 
   attention in the Security Council and the General Assembly. India co- 
   sponsored the Resolution in the UN for the admission of Slovenia, 
   Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as members of the UN and joined in 
   Security Council Resolutions imposing sanctions on FRY in an attempt to 
   ensure that FRY adopted a more supportive role in bringing peace to 
   Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
    
   <br><br>India fully supported the Security Council Resolutions aimed at 
   resolving the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, 
   India abstained on Resolutions permitting the use of force for 
   protection of humanitarian convoys on the grounds that this was contrary 
   to her principled position that all use of force sanctioned by the UN 
   must remain under full UN command and control. India also abstained on 
   the Resolution denying FRY's right to participate in the General 
   Assembly. 
    
   <br><br>The efforts of UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the UN operations in 
   former Yugoslavia under the command of an Indian national, Lt General 
   Satish Nambiar, received universal appreciation. 
    
   <br><br>India joined other members of the Security Council in approving the 
   deployment of a UN battalion in Macedonia, which though still 
   unrecognised as a member State of the UN, had requested for a UN 
   presence on its territory in view of the perceived threat from its 
   neighbours. 
    
   <br><br>The tragic situation in Somalia was the focus of Security Council's 
   attention, particularly in the second half of 1992. India supported the 
   UN action in rushing humanitarian assistance to Somalia and has 
   participated in this 
    
    
   operation. In addition, the remaining assets from the AFRICA Fund, after 
   it had been wound up, as mandated by the Tenth NAM Summit in Jakarta in 
   September 1992, were released for relief efforts in Somalia. 
   <br>-84&gt; 
   <br><br>UNTAC, the UN operation in Cambodia, initiated measures to organize 
   elections to a Constituent Assembly in Cambodia by May 1993. India has 
   welcomed the progress achieved so far by UNTAC and has contributed 
   civilian-and military personnel to these UN operations. 
    
   <br><br>UN operations in other parts of the world met with success and setbacks 
   during 1992. The successful completion of the UN operation in El 
   Salvador was welcomed by India. Similarly, UN operations in Angola were 
   successful in organizing Presidential and Legislative elections in 
   Angola in late September. India participated in both the operations. 
   India maintained her traditional support for the efforts to resolve the 
   long-standing problem of Cyprus, with a view to endorsing the latter's 
   sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. India also supported the 
   establishment of a new major UN operation in Mozambique to oversee the 
   implementation of the peace accords signed between the Government and 
   RENAMO. India also supported Security Council action in sending UN 
   observers to South Africa to monitor developments after the Boipatong 
   massacre and to assist in the resumption of negotiations on political 
   reform. Several issues relating to the Commonwealth of Independent 
   States were also the subject of deliberations in the Security Council 
   including the situation in Nagorno Karabakh. India welcomed the 
   applications for UN membership of new States that had emerged following 
   the break-up of the Soviet Union and fully supported the. efforts to 
   bring peace to the region. 
    
   <br><br>A major Indian initiative in 1992 was the tabling of a Resolution at the 
   47th General Assembly on the question of equitable representation and 
   increase in membership of the Security Council. The Resolution was 
   tabled after extensive consultations with a representative cross-section 
   of countries and was adopted by consensus. In its statement India 
   emphasised the need to apply the principle of democracy within the UN 
   itself and underlined that if the Security Council was to represent the 
   collective will of the international community and ensure its moral 
   sanction, the members of the UN must have a wider representation on the 
   Security Council. 
    
   <br><br>In response to a call made at the Security Council Summit held in 1992, 
   the UN Secretary General had put forward a report entitled "An Agenda 
   for Peace" on preventive diplomacy and peace-making and peace-keeping. 
   This was the subject of extensive consultations and deliberations during 
    
    
   the year both in the Security Council and the General Assembly. India 
   played an important role in ensuring that respect for the principles of 
   sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations was maintained. She 
   also played a critical role in ensuring that when sanctions are imposed 
   by the Security Council the special economic problems faced by other 
   countries are sympathetically considered. 
   <br>-85&gt; 
   <br><br>India also participated actively in the high-level group under the aegis 
   of NAM on the restructuring of the UN. India's active involvement at 
   every stage ensured that NAM proposals took into account her 
   sensitivities. 
    
   <br><br>The Special Committee of the UN on Peace Keeping Operations held two 
   meetings in 1992 to prepare a comprehensive report on UN peace-keeping 
   operations and to consider the Secretary General's report - An Agenda 
   for Peace. India played an active role in ensuring that the report 
   incorporated the principle of consent of the host nation and approval of 
   all concerned parties before such peace-keeping operations could be 
   undertaken. She also took a principled stand on the need for the member 
   States to pay their dues and put peace-keeping operations on a durable 
   and stable financial footing. 
    
   <br><br>As rapporteur of the Special Committee Against Apartheid, India played 
   an important role in drafting of the Resolutions on South Africa and the 
   preparation of the annual report of this Committee. 
    
   India played its- traditionally active moderating role in the UN 
   Decolonisation Committee, particularly on the issue of UN-supervised 
   referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara. 
    
   <br><br>The 47th General Assembly adopted after a vote a resolution on 
   "Implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of 
   Peace", with India voting in favour. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian 
   Ocean is to hold a ten day session in 1993 and would submit 
   recommendations for consideration by the 48th General Assembly. As early 
   as possible thereafter, the Conference on the Indian Ocean is to be 
   convened at Colombo with the participation of the permanent members of 
   the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean. 
    
   <br><br>During 1992, a series of meetings under the aegis of the Antarctica 
   Treaty System were held including the first meeting of experts on 
   Antarctic Environment which was held in Buenos Aires in June 1992 and 
   the XVII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting held in Venice in 
   November 1992. India participated actively to ensure that her concerns 
   were fully reflected 
   -86&gt; 
    
   in the deliberations and outcome of these meetings. In the General 
   Assembly, in a departure from previous practice, the two traditional 
   resolutions on Antarctica were amalgamated. As a result, India joined 
   other members of the Antarctica Treaty Consultative Parties in the non- 
   participation in the vote on the Resolution but made an explanation of 
   the position on the question of South African participation in the 
   Antarctica Treaty.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>Through 1992, India continued to play its traditionally leading role in 
   the three main multilateral disarmament fora, viz, the Conference on 
   Disarmament in Geneva, the UN Disarmament Commission and the First 
   Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York. 
    
   <br><br>India's approach to disarmament has continued to be guided by the basic 
   philosophy that in the nuclear age, disarmament measures, specially 
   nuclear disarmament, should be undertaken in a time bound manner to 
   ensure the survival of mankind. India continues to maintain that the 
   priorities for disarmament which are postulated in the consensus final 
   document of the First Special Session of the UN General Assembly devoted 
   to Disarmament are relevant. India's approach to general and complete 
   disarmament has been best elaborated in the Action Plan for a Nuclear 
   Weapon Free and Non-Violent World Order tabled at the Third Special 
   Session of the UN General Assembly devoted to disarmament in 1988. 
    
   <br><br>In the Conference on Disarmament (CD), which is the sole multilateral 
   negotiating body, India played a leading role in the group of neutral 
   and non-aligned countries, otherwise known as G-21. The G-21 worked 
   closely with delegations from other member countries to unanimously 
   conclude a historic draft text on a Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). 
   The CWC is comprehensive, non-discriminatory and has universal 
   application. It seeks to eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass 
   destruction. The CWC takes into account the concerns, of developing 
   countries in regard to their economic and technological development. 
   India has also ensured for itself a seat on the Executive Council based 
   on industrial criteria. 
    
   <br><br>The Indian delegation was appointed as Special Coordinator to seek 
   agreement on an organizational arrangement for a crucial agenda item 
   "Nuclear Test Ban" for which an ad-hoc group is sought to be set up in 
   1993. India continued to highlight the urgent need for commencing 
   negotiations for a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, stressing that its scope 
   should be consistent with the preamble of the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 
   1963 that 
    
    
   seeks to achieve a total ban on all tests of nuclear weapons in all 
   environments and for all time. India also took part in the meeting of 
   the ad-hoc Group of Governmental Experts on Verification, established by 
   a decision of the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the BW 
   Convention. 
   <br>-87&gt;
  <br><br> At the UN Disarmament Commission, consideration of the agenda item 
   "objective information on military matters" was completed. The 
   Commission also adopted by consensus the draft resoultion on the "Report 
   of the Disarmament Commission". 
    
   <br><br>The outstanding achievement at the 47th session of the UN General 
   Assembly was the unanimous commendation by member States of the CWC for 
   signature and ratification. The CWC is the first multilaterally 
   negotiated, comprehensive and verifiable disarmament agreement, which 
   India hopes would become a model for other disarmament agreements. India 
   played a leading role in the formal establishment of the UN Register of 
   Conventional Arms. India had also participated in the Panel of 
   Governmental Experts that worked out the details of the Register. On the 
   issue of the 1995 Conference on the NPT, India called for a 
   reconsideration and amendment of the Treaty's provisions to make it into 
   a universal and non-discriminatory regime for non-proliferation. India 
   introduced two resolutions entitled "Scientific and Technological 
   Developments and their Impact on International Security" which received 
   128 votes in support and the "Convention of Prohibition of the Use of 
   Nuclear Weapons" which was passed with an overwhelming majority. 
    
   <br><br>Bilateral discussions with the USA on regional security and non- 
   proliferation issues continued in 1992. The Foreign Secretary visited 
   Washington from 9 to 11 March 1992, where he held wide ranging 
   discussions with a number of US officials. India's position on signing 
   the NPT was reaffirmed. India also highlighted its position that 
   regional security cannot be confined to an artificially demarcated zone. 
   In June, a US delegation led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Ms 
   Teresita. Schaffer, held discussions in New Delhi on issues concerning 
   non-proliferation and disarmament. India's security concerns in the 
   context of the changing global environment were explained and it was 
   emphasized that a regional security paradigm must encompass the security 
   concerns of all states of the region. As a follow up to the visit of the 
   US delegation, another round of bilateral talks were held in Washington 
   on 12 and 13 November 1992. Global security issues including US-Russian 
   arms reduction agreements, the Chemical Weapons Convention and 
   developments in the West Asia were discussed. Bilateral discussions 
    
    
   on disarmament and non-proliferation issues were held with the United 
   Kingdom during the year. 
   <br>-88&gt;
  <br><br> Outside the three main multilateral disarmament fora, India continued to 
   provide support to disarmament initiatives taken by non-governmental 
   organizations and actively participated in meetings organized by them.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>In 1992, the major economic issues considered by the General Assembly 
   were environment and sustainable development, the triennial review of 
   operational activities and the restructuring of the UN in economic and 
   social spheres. While the deliberations in the UN on environment and 
   development flowed from the outcome of the UN Conference on Environment 
   and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June, the issues of 
   restructuring of the UN and the triennial review of operational 
   activities assumed a high profile, overshadowing the more traditional 
   resolutions on issues such as debt, net transfer of resources, AIDS, 
   privatisation and poverty. 
    
   <br><br>The UN Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro 
   in June 1992 marked a major milestone in the evolution of an 
   international consensus on development and environment related issues. 
   At this Summit, a detailed programme of action - Agenda 21 and a 
   Statement of Principles on Forests was adopted. Two important- 
   Conventions were opened for signatures at UNCED - a Framework Convention 
   on Climate Change and Convention on Bio-diversity- both of which were 
   signed by India at Rio. The Indian delegation to the UNCED Summit was 
   led by the Prime Minister who was the first to address its Summit level 
   segment. Prime Minister emphasised that we cannot have conservation of 
   the environment without the promise of development even as we cannot 
   have sustained development without the preservation of the environment. 
   India played an active role in the preparatory process for and at the 
   UNCED Summit, emphasising the close interlinkage between economic 
   development issues and protection of the environment. 
    
   <br><br>During the 47th General Assembly, several Resolutions were adopted as a 
   follow-up of the decision taken at UNCED. These included a Resolution 
   launching negotiations on a Convention to control Drought and 
   Desertification, a Resolution to prepare for a Conference on small 
   island developing states, a Conference on highly migratory fish stocks 
   and a Resolution on the establishment of a high-level Commission on 
   Sustainable Development (CSD). The CSD will be a 53-member functional 
   Commission 
    
    
   of ECOSOC and will monitor and review the implementation of Agenda 21. 
   During the 47th General Assembly too India played an active role in 
   emphasising the linkage between environment and development and in 
   ensuring that the focus on the CSD included a provision of new and 
   additional resources for developing countries as well as the promotion 
   and monitoring of transfer of technologies to developing countries on 
   concessional and preferential terms. 
   <br>-89&gt; 
   <br><br>At the 47th General Assembly, it was also decided that the second UN 
   Conference on Human Settlement would be held in Turkey in 1997. India 
   played a major role in the establishment of the preparatory process for 
   this meeting. On other traditional economic issues such as trade, 
   finance, investment and technology, India continued to play an important 
   role in galvanising the opinion of like-minded developing countries. 
    
   <br><br>In 1992, a triennial review of operational activities of the UN was 
   undertaken. India played a major role in formulation of the draft 
   Resolution and in ensuring that coordination and execution of 
   operational activities would remain the national responsibility and in 
   ensuring that the Resident Coordinator's mandate is confined to 
   development activities. 
    
   <br><br>As a follow-up of Resolution 46/182 which was adopted at the last 
   General Assembly in 1992, the General Assembly considered the question 
   of emergency humanitarian assistance. India played an active role in 
   ensuring that the principle that it is the primary responsibility of the 
   concerned State to provide for such assistance and that whenever and 
   wherever UN undertakes coordination of humanitarian assistance, it is 
   done with full involvement of the recipient Government at all stages. 
    
   <br><br>The Summit Level Group on South-South Consultation and Cooperation (G- 
   15) is an important global institution for furthering measures aimed at 
   developing concrete programmes of South-South cooperation and 
   indentifying and articulating global economic issues of common concern 
   to the developing countries with a view to initiating a North-South 
   dialogue thereon. India has made important contributions to the G-15 
   process and in 1992, these activities were further strengthened. 
    
  <br><br>Under the programme of South-South cooperation, further progress was 
   made with regard to the specific projects identified at the First and 
   Second Summits of the G-15 which were held in Kuala Lumpur and Caracas 
   in 1990 and in 1991 respectively. It may be recalled that the G-15 Heads 
   of State/Government had mandated India to develop projects on the 
    
    
   establishment of Gene Banks for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and also 
   on Solar Energy Applications. 
   <br>-90&gt;
   <br><br>Under the project for the establishment of Gene Banks for Medicinal and 
   Aromatic Plants, the first meeting of the Regional Coordinators and the 
   Scientific Advisory Committee was held in New Delhi from 24 to 26 June 
   1992. Likewise, the meeting of G-15 experts on Solar Energy Application 
   was convened in New Delhi from 2 to 5 September 1992. The Expert 
   Committees, during these meetings, drew up a concrete plan of action in 
   order to identify priorities and implement the agreed measures. 
    
   <br><br>The Third Summit meeting of the G-15 was held in Dakar, Senegal, from 21 
   to 23 November 1992. India was represented at the Summit meeting by 
   Prime Minister, Shri P V Narasimha Rao. The Third Summit was noteworthy 
   in respect of the many new cooperation projects which were tabled and 
   approved for further action. India's contribution in respect of Solar 
   Energy Applications and Gene Banks was appreciated. India, furthermore, 
   offered additional projects, viz Vocational Training Centre to be 
   established in Africa and Computer Training Centre in New Delhi. These 
   new Indian offers were warmly received in the Summit meeting and 
   approved for implementation. <br><br>

<tr><td>The Third G-15 Summit meeting emphasised the need to foster South-South 
   contacts at the level of business leaders, technical experts and 
   institutions dealing with trade, technology, banking and industry in the 
   countries of the South. The Summit also felt that a constructive North- 
   South dialogue, free from rhetoric and ideological rigidities of the 
   past, would enable better management of the interdependent global 
   economy and mutual benefits to the countries of the North as well as the 
   South. 
    
  <br><br> With the conclusion of the Dakar Summit, the chairmanship of G-15 
   devolves of India as she would be hosting the Fourth Summit which 
   tentatively is scheduled to be held in New Delhi in the latter half of 
   November 1993. 
    
   <br><br>The Summit meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations 
   (ASEAN), met on 27 and 28 January 1992, approved India as a Sectoral 
   Dialogue Partner. The sectoral dialogue will concentrate on trade, 
   technology, tourism and human resource development. The sectoral 
   dialogue would facilitate development of braod-based ties between India 
   and the ASEAN countries. 
    
   <br><br>On global economic issues, the major focus remained on the future of the 
   Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The future of the 
    
    
   Uruguay Round had been cast into doubt following the inability of some 
   of the major industrialised countries to agree on a package of reforms 
   in the agriculture sector. Apart from the impasse over agriculture, in 
   many of the so-called new areas, viz, trade related intellectual 
   property rights (TRIPs) and world trade in services, a consensus proved 
   elusive. There are apprehensions that any further delay in concluding 
   the Uruguay Round would. lead to a breakdown of genuinely multilateral 
   world trading system into regional groupings and an increasing resort to 
   unilateral and bilateral measures. Towards the end of the year, however, 
   with a resolution of the vexed agriculture issue in sight, the hopes of 
   early completion of the Round were revived.

   of social and humanitarian issues. India's stand on such issues was 
   based on its principled stand on matters pertaining to human rights and 
   social justice and its deep and abiding Commitment to the protection and 
   promotion of human rights. India participated in the deliberations of 
   the UN Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection

   human rights are indivisible and that while democracy was the best 
   guarantor of human rights, there would be no realisation of human rights 
   without economic development or enjoyment of human rights. India also 
   highlighted the threat to human rights posed by the phenomenon of extra-

   violations by India. The incidents at Ayodhya were also raised by 
   Pakistan and certain other countries in the Third Committee under the

<tr><td> At its 47th Session, the Sixth Committee (Legal Committee) of the United 
   Nations General Assembly considered 14 Agenda items during its 
   deliberations from 18 September to 25 November 1992. The major Agenda 
   items among these related to the work of the International Law 
   Commission (ILC), the United Nations Commission on International Trade 
   Law (UNCITRAL), the United Nations Special Committee on the Charter and 
   the strengthening of the role of the Organization, protection of the 
   environment in times of armed conflict, draft convention on

   Code of Crimes against the peace and security of mankind, particularly 
   the question of establishment of an international criminal court, state 
   responsibility and the international liability for injurious 
   consequences arising out of acts not prohibited under international law. 
   The Indian delegation participated actively in the Committee's 
   deliberations on other items, including its consultations on several 
   matters. At this Session, the General Assembly also decided to include 
   on its agenda for the 48th Session a new item regarding seeking of an 
   advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on abductions 
   abroad. 
   <br>-95&gt;

   <br><br>The Legal Sub-Committee of the UN Commitee on Peaceful Uses of Outer 
   Space held its 31st Session in Geneva from 23 March to 10 April 1992. 
   The substantive issues discussed during the Session related to draft 
   principles of nuclear power sources in Outer Space, definition and 
   delimitation of Outer Space, character and utilisation of the 
   geostationary orbit, and legal aspects related to the Outer Space 
   benefits taking into account the needs of the developing countries. The 
   Sub-Committee registered substantial progress on the draft principles 
   concerning the nuclear power sources and the agreed principles were 
   approved by the UN General Assembly at its regular 47th Session in 
   December 1992. On other matters the discussions held have yet to achieve 
   agreement. 
    
   <br><br>The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) held the second technical 
   conference on the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, at 
   Rome in July 1992. The aim of the draft convention prepared by the FAO

<tr class="evenRow"><td>DURING THE YEAR, THE ECONOMIC DIVISION PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE 
   furtherance of India's economic and commercial interests abroad. Steps 
   were undertaken to reorient the functioning of Indian Missions so that 
   they could play more active role in promotion of India's exports both in 
   terms of commodities and projects. Special emphasis has been given on 
   promoting exports in extreme focus areas. Regular and close liaison was 
   maintained with the trade and industry organizations to make the 
   Economic Division's functioning more responsive to the country's 
   economic needs. All Missions were asked to prepare comprehensive 
   economic and commercial notes on countries of their accreditation, which 
   were passed on to the trade and industry associations for dissemination 
   among the business community. Commercial queries and information on 
   tenders and projects were also conveyed to concerned parties and trade 
   promotion bodies in India. 
    
   <br><br>Action has been initiated to create a comprehensive data bank on 
   bilateral economic relations with India's important trading partners so 
   that useful input could be provided for economic policy decisions. To 
   assist the commercial representatives in Indian Missions, the Economic 
   Division brought out the third edition of the Trade Directory containing 
   useful information on export promotion bodies, commodity boards, 
   important public sector organizations, trade and industry bodies, 
   institutions dealing with credit and finance besides references of 
   Government officials dealing with trade promotion and investment issues. 
   The Division also initiated an action programme for update of 
   directories published by trade promotion bodies and trade and industry 
   bodies and even by private commercial firms so that these could be made 
   available to the Indian commercial representatives abroad for wider 
   dissemination of commercial information. 
    
   <br><br>The Economic Division also assisted in mobilising foreign participants 
   and visitors to trade fairs in India. Trade and industry delegations 
   visiting abroad were extended all possible assistance to make their 
   visits productive and useful. The Division was also instrumental in 
   activating the joint Business Councils and promoting them as forums for 
   furthering India's 
    
    
   economic interests through participation of private entrepreneurs and 
   business and industry organizations. 
   <br>-98&gt; 
   <br><br>In close cooperation with the Inter-Ministerial Committee on joint 
   Ventures abroad, Indian Missions have been asked by the Economic 
   Division to monitor the performance of Indian Joint Ventures abroad. An 
   appropriate mechanism for such monitoring is presently under 
   finalisation. 
    
   <br><br>The Economic Division also oversees the operation of the Indian 
   Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme and the Special 
   Commonwealth African Assistance Programme (SCAAP). The Programmes have 
   been suitably reoriented to meet the requirements of South-South 
   cooperation as well as for supporting Indian economic and commercial 
   interest abroad. The Programmes have also been extended to cover 
   countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America. 
    
   <br><br>Human resource development forms a basic element of the Programmes. 
   During the year, over 900 foreign ' nominees were imparted specialised 
   training in India. New courses in frontier technologies such as computer 
   hardware and software were introduced. Special training modules in 
   diplomacy, banking, foreign trade, entrepreneurship, etc, were organized 
   for nominees from Central Asian countries. 
    
   <br><br>During the year an average of 40 experts were on deputation under the 
   ITEC programme in various countries. Indian experts for the first time 
   were deputed to the Central Asian countries. The major beneficiaries 
   have been Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Mauritius, 
   Namibia, Seychelles, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia. 
    
   <br><br>Nearly 500 military personnel from about 30 countries attended 
   Army/Navy/Air Force courses of instructions in India. A large number of 
   the trainees came from South Asian and African countries. Considerable 
   interest exists among their countries in availing of training facilities 
   in Indian military institutions. 
    
   <br><br>Emergency relief assistance has been extended to Afghanistan, Botswana, 
   Ethiopia, Kenya, Kyrghyzstan, Madagascar, Mozambique, Mongolia, Namibia, 
   Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These countries 
   have suffered from natural disasters. Assistance provided to them 
   included baby food, milk powder, blankets, medicines, etc. 
    
<br><br>The major projects undertaken during the year under ITEC assistance 
   included the Indira Gandhi International Child Hospital (IGICH) 
   Expansion 
    
    
   Project in Afghanistan, the 7th phase of the Angkor Vat Restoration 
   Project in Cambodia, the Hand Tool Manufacturing and Demonstration 
   Centre in the Philippines, and the Court House Project in Mauritius. In 
   addition, a number of feasibility studies and pilot projects have been 
   undertaken or initiated under the programme. Some of these are to be 
   undertaken in the Central Asian countries. 
   <br>-99&gt; 
   <br><br>The visit of a delegation from Cambodia comprising two Senior 
   Archaeologists took place under the ITEC Programme in September 1992 for 
   archaeological study and conservation of monuments. 
    
   <br><br>A study visit from Mexico took place in November 1992. The visitors were 
   exposed to a vast range of Indian industry. They also visited the India 
   International Trade Fair (IITF) in New Delhi. Cooperation in the Small 
   Scale Sectors was identified for future collaboration. Like in the 
   previous year, 15 September was celebrated as the 'ITEC Day' by select 
   Missions abroad. The occasion was utilised to maintain and strengthen 
   contact with former ITEC alumni and was also utilised for forming ITEC 
   alumni associations. A documentary produced by XP Division entitled 
   'Building Bridges' on the ITEC Programme was also arranged to be 
   telecast locally by the Indian Missions. 
    
   <br><br>In the context of India's liberalised economic policies and the 
   consequent emphasis on expanding trade, investment and technology flows, 
   Ministry of External Affairs has worked through its Missions and Posts 
   abroad in giving priority to India's economic and commercial interests. 
   In the period under review, the activities of the Economic Coordination 
   Unit (ECU) have reflected the growing focus on economic and commercial 
   issues. 
    
   <br><br>ECU has given special attention to the requirement of external economic 
   publicity in the context of the need to effectively disseminate 
   information about the economic reform programme to the international 
   business community. The composite media package aimed at projecting 
   India as an attractive investment destination that was prepared by ECU 
   was comprehensively updated in April 1992 and further revisions are 
   underway. The floppy diskette entitled 'Doing Business with India' which 
   was introduced last year as an innovative way of disseminating 
   information about policies and procedures for investors has been 
   regularly updated during the current year. 
    
  <br><br> Apart from preparing this promotional material which was intended 
   primarily for use by Indian Missions abroad but has also been in demand 
    
    
   from the major economic Ministries when they have sent delegations 
   abroad or when foreign business delegations have come to India, ECU has 
   also been playing a more direct role in the country's efforts to attract 
   investment. It has been directly involved in arranging programmes for 
   visiting business delegations, facilitating their interaction with 
   concerned Ministries and business entities and organizing investment 
   promotion events in target countries. Two of the important events 
   coordinated by ECU were investment promotion seminars organized in Los 
   Angeles and the West Coast of the USA in April 1992, and in Taiwan in 
   October 1992. It also helped with the Business International Round Table 
   in Delhi in May 1992. In addition, ECU has also provided back-up support 
   to the promotional events organized by a number of Indian Missions 
   including those in Bonn, Brussels, The Hague, Singapore, etc. 
   Recognising the importance of following up on the leads established at 
   these various investment promotion events, it has been specially active 
   in ensuring timely and close coordination between potential investors 
   and the concerned Ministries and organizations in India. 
   <br>-100&gt; 
  <br><br> Another important aspect of ECU's investment promotion efforts has been 
   its interactions with the economic Ministries with the purpose of 
   keeping Indian Missions, especially those in target countries informed 
   on a regular and immediate basis of the on-going changes in India's 
   economic policies. It has also instituted a system of obtaining regular 
   feedback from Missions on responses/reactions to India's economic reform 
   programme among the industrialised countries in general and the 
   international business community in particular. This feedback has formed 
   the basis of periodic reports that this Ministry has sent to the Foreign 
   Investment Promotion Board on on-going investment promotion efforts and 
   on the bottlenecks that still remain to be removed to facilitate 
   significant inflows of foreign capital. 
    
   <br><br>Finally, as a natural corollary to these activities, ECU has liaised 
   closely with apex industry organizations, business houses, concerned 
   Ministries and State Governments on ways and means of facilitating 
   investment procedures and improving the overall quality of investment 
   promotion efforts. The attempt here has been to focus on specific 
   projects and specific issues. One of the results of such interaction was 
   the preparation of a shelf of projects that could be offered for equity 
   participation to potential investors from Gulf region. This initiative 
   was taken by way of specific follow-up action to the interest expressed 
   by the UAE President in obtaining specific project profiles for 
   investment during the course of his visit to India in April and it 
   culminated in the visit of a business delegation to Abu Dhabi in 
   November with the objective of discussing investment proposals in areas 
   in which UAE had expressed a preliminary interest.

<tr><td>THE POLICY PLANNING WING WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PREPARING BRIEFS AND 
   background notes on issues concerning India's foreign policy in the 
   rapidly evolving international situation. 
    
  <br><br> It is also the nodal point for interaction with joint Intelligence 
   Committee, the University Grants Commission and its affiliated Area 
   Study Centres attached to various Universities. These activities were 
   strengthened during the year. 
    
   <br><br>It has also given financial assistance for Seminars and Conferences on 
   international issues. The Wing has also financed study and research 
   projects undertaken by scholars and academic organizations on subjects 
   relevant to Ministry of External Affairs. 
    
   <br><br>The Research Wing rendered all possible help to the Territorial 
   Divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad on India's international 
   boundary problems or whenever any specific information or documents on 
   international relations were required. 
    
  <br><br> The Research Wing examined the incorrect depiction of India's 
   international boundaries in maps printed in foreign publications, both 
   official and private. The matter of incorrect maps was then taken up 
   with the concerned Government or the publishers through Indian Missions 
   abroad for necessary corrective measures. It coordinated the accord of 
   approval to new Survey of India maps depicting international boundaries 
   of India. It also coordinated with the Survey of India and the Ministry 
   of Defence the supply of mapsheets to various Government and semi- 
   Government agencies for use in their official work. 
    
   <br><br>The Research Wing dealt with the requests from research scholars in 
   consultation with the concerned Territorial Division for access to the 
   records of the Ministry relating to the restricted areas or the closed 
   period as laid down in the Access Rules. It also scrutinised the 
   excerpts of the closed period records submitted by the research scholars 
   for clearance in consultation with the concerned Territorial Divisions. 
   <br>-102&gt; 
    
  <br><br> An important task of the Wing is to edit and supervise printing of the 
   Annual Report of the Ministry on the basis of the material prepared by 
   the various Divisions. 
    
   <br><br>The Printing of Old Records (POR) Unit of the Research Wing edited and 
   printed selected old policy files of the Ministry. The POR Unit also 
   undertook the review/weeding of old files in the Record Management 
   Section of the Ministry and also advised the Missions abroad in the same 
   work. Similarly, the Unit reviewed old records of the Ministry which 
   were transferred to the National Archives of India in the past. 
    
   <br><br>The Research Section of the Wing coordinated the distribution of 
   periodical reports received from Indian Missions abroad. 
    
   <br><br>To support the research efforts, a library equipped with modern 
   facilities and large resource material is maintained with over one 
   hundred thousand books and documents in its collection. During last 
   year, 1255 books, 32 maps, 450 pamphlets, and 36 reels of microfilm were 
   added. The Library subscribes to 600 periodical titles. 
    
   <br><br>The Library is equipped with in-house computer system with 9 terminals, 
   two of which support data entry and retrieval in Indian languages, a 
   microfilm/fiche reader printer and a plain paper photocopier. 
    
   <br><br>Documentation/Bibliographic Services as well as other library operations 
   and services were computerised using an integrated software package 
   developed in India. ' Information about books and selected periodical 
   articles received in Library since 1986 is available on-line through 
   each terminal. All new documents received in Library-books, maps, 
   microfilms, selected articles from periodicals, etc-are being fed into 
   the in-house computer system to create Database on Foreign Affairs. 
   Using this Database, the Library provides Current Awareness Service and 
   Bibliographical Services. In addition, the Library regularly issued a 
   monthly Chronicle of Events, a Foreign Affairs Documentation Bulletin 
   and an annotated monthly list of recent additions to the Library. 
    
   <br><br>Library users including research scholars can access on-line computer- 
   based information held in Library in different databases through Foreign 
   Affairs Information Retrieval System (FAIRS). Photocopying and computer 
   print-out facilities are also available to all Library users including 
   research scholars.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>DURING THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW, THE EXTERNAL PUBLICITY DIVISION WAS 
   actively engaged in discharging its responsibility of projecting India's 
   position on various issues and developments in India as well as 
   countering propaganda directed against India. Simultaneously, due, 
   emphasis was given to dissemination of credible information relating to 
   the positive aspects of India's economic, scientific and technological 
   progress and underlining the sustained march of Indian democracy. 
    
  <br><br> A thrust was given to the wide publicity on the new policy initiative 
   undertaken by the present Government, particularly, the drive for 
   economic liberalisation including the country's concerted efforts to 
   attract foreign investment. This was done through the publication of a 
   number of booklets, including the "New Economic Policies"; in various 
   languages. Over 6,000 copies of a package, consisting of a diskette and 
   four brochures on "Doing Business with India", were distributed world- 
   wide. 
    
  <br><br> The External Publicity Division continued to assist Indian 
   Missions/Posts abroad with publicity material in different languages for 
   distribution to local dignitaries, prominent persons, opinion-makers and 
   academic institutions, etc. The important new publications included 
   "India-A Democracy on the Move", "Muslims in India", and a set of media 
   kits and tourist literature. These publications depict India's 
   achievements in the fields of foreign policy, science and technology, 
   agriculture and rural development, education and poverty alleviation as 
   well as our social and cultural norms and values and the secular and 
   democratic set-up of the country. These publications have been 
   especially designed with the objective of acquainting foreign audiences 
   with the multi-faceted nature of the Indian polity and the sustained 
   progress of independent India. 
    
   <br><br>"India Perspectives", which is now being published in 10 languages with 
   the launch of the German edition in October 1992 has emerged as a major 
   component in publicity efforts. The magazine widened the scope of its 
   readers and feedback from Indian Missions was encouraging. However, 
   while the total requirement of the Missions for "India Perspectives" 
   works out to be more than 56,000 copies per month, only 51,000 copies 
   were printed because of paucity of funds. 
  <br> -104&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The Division continued to regularly brief the foreign and Indian Press 
   about India's policy on various issues. Government's swift response on 
   the Ayodhya issue and all steps taken to counter communal forces were 
   disseminated to all the Missions abroad in order to enable them to 
   present India's point of view to foreign officials, foreign governments 
   as well as Media, opinion makers and others. During the period under 
   review almost daily press briefings were held for the media and press 
   releases issued. In all, more than 596 Official Spokesman's 
   statements/press releases were issued. The policy of offering 
   hospitality to select mediamen from abroad and rendering assistance in 
   their travel within the country to enable them to meet a cross section 
   of the Indian people was also continued. The Indian Missions abroad, 
   too, kept in regular touch with the foreign media to brief them about 
   the current developments in India and provide them with factual material 
   on matters of current interest. This was facilitated by transmission of 
   twice-daily bulletins to 71 Missions abroad. Besides, 40 Missions 
   received bi-weekly bulletins while 32 Missions, identified as "Core- 
   Missions", received clippings from the Indian Press/Press Summary on a 
   daily basis. 
    
   <br><br>A special emphasis has been placed on the circulation of audio-visual 
   material to Indian Missions abroad which have been equipped with TV sets 
   and VCRs. The Missions are regularly supplied with video news cassettes, 
   capsules of "India Magazine" as well as documentaries on diverse 
   subjects relating to India. Various sources including Doordarshan, Films 
   Division and private producers have been tapped in this regard. A number 
   of Missions have also been authorised to install dish antennae to enable 
   them keep in touch with the latest developments and to tune into 
   programmes of Doordarshan, wherever possible. 
    
   <br><br>The anti-India campaign, launched by Pakistan, is being countered on all 
   fronts. The XP Division countered this through briefings to foreign 
   Journalists and supply of material giving facts of the situation to 
   Indian Missions abroad. Publicity material on the activities of the 
   militants and Pakistan's clandestine support to the terrorists was 
   widely distributed to foreign governments as well as opinion-makers, 
   officials, media persons and others. This multi-pronged approach led to 
   an understanding of India's point of view in many circles. Countering 
   malicious and mischievous anti-India campaign by Pakistan is an on-going 
   process in the Division. Important news items, relating to Punjab and 
   Kashmir, are regularly sent to Indian Missions abroad for further 
   dissemination. Fact sheets, made available by the Ministry of Home 
   Affairs, relating to alleged human-rights violations 
    
    
   in India, are sent to some of the Missions to enable them counter these 
   allegations.<br>-105&gt; 
   <br><br> 
   The XP Division continued to make available feature articles from Indian 
   News Agencies to the Indian Missions abroad. Special articles were also 
   commissioned on the occasion of Republic Day and the Independence Day 
   for highlighting India's multi-dimensional achievements in diverse 
   fields. This facilitated efforts of the Missions to bring out special 
   supplements in foreign newspapers on these two occasions. Two feature 
   articles titled "India and NAM" and "NAM Summit in Jakarta" were 
   commissioned on a special basis and distributed to Indian Mission in 
   Jakarta on the eve of the 10th NAM Summit. Several feature articles were 
   commissioned by PTI and sent to all the Missions abroad for use as 
   special supplement on the occasion of the Republic Day in 1993. 
    
   <br><br>The audio-visual arm of the Division completed/produced several films 
   during the period including "Axis-Mundi" (on restoration work at Angkor 
   Vat), "Continuity in Change" (on the life, culture, history and essence 
   of India) and "Building, Bridges" (on the ITEC Programme). These have 
   been distributed to all Missions after duplication and conversion into 
   various colour systems/schemes. Some of these have also been telecast at 
   various places abroad on suitable occasions. Meanwhile, a documentary on 
   contemporary Indian art, featuring two Indian painters, has recently 
   been completed. Several other films are in advance stages of production. 
    
   <br><br>A number of retrospectives of the late Shri Satyajit Ray have been held 
   in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Singapore, Muscat, Canada, UK, 
   Phillipines, Chile, Argentina, Trinidad and Tobago and other places and 
   are scheduled in several others. Telecasts of Indian films abroad either 
   on a commercial or non-commercial basis have also been arranged by the 
   Division and Indian Missions abroad. A major Indian participation in the 
   Tashkent Film Festival was organized and a Raj Kapoor package, which 
   later travelled to other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
   cities, was also arranged in coordination with the Directorate of Film 
   Festivals (DFF). Offers to coordinate and promote, commercially and 
   culturally, Indian films abroad are being made in conjunction with NFDC, 
   Doordarshan, Films Division and DFF. 
    
   <br><br>The Division hosted 7 journalists from abroad during the period and 
   committed itself to visits of 9 more foreign journalists. So far 
   mediamen from China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Israel, Turkey, Malaysia 
   and Austria have visited India under this programme. Pursuant to Prime 
   Minister's 
    
    
   directive of inviting economic journalists to enable them have first- 
   hand information about the economic changes in India, core Missions in 
   selected countries were asked to extend invitations to prominent 
   economic journalists. Feedback received by the Division suggests that 
   such visits have succeeded in generating goodwill and promoting the 
   cause of favourable projection of India's views and concerns on 
   international issues. 
    <br>-106&gt;
   <br><br>XP Division looked after logistics/media arrangements for VVIP visits 
   abroad. During the period under review, the Division has handled media 
   arrangements and logistics for journalists accompanying the Vice 
   President to North Korea and Mongolia, the President to China and the 
   Prime Minister to Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Lisbon, Jakarta, Paris, 
   Kathmandu, Tunis and Dakar. 
    
   <br><br>The Division facilitated media arrangements for the foreign journalists 
   accompanying the VVIPs on their visits to India. Liaison Officers from 
   XPR Section was attached with each visiting delegation. The following 
   VVIPs visited India during the period: 
    
   <br><br>The Thai Crown Prince, the UN Secretary General, the President of 
   Turkmenistan, the President of UAE, the Russian State Secretary, the 
   Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Mauritius, the General 
   Secretary of Vietnam, the Sultan of Brunei, the President of Sri Lanka, 
   the President of Uganda, the Prince &amp; Princess of Japan and the Aga 
   Khan. 
    
   <br><br>XPR Section also arranged the media coverage for the incoming visits of 
   12 Foreign Ministers from different countries and 4 other VIP and 
   Parliamentary delegations.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>THE PRESSURE OF HEAVY DEMAND FOR PASSPORT AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES 
at the Passport Offices in India continued in 1992 with the receipt of 
24,72,428 applications for fresh passports. 
<br> 
<br>The output of the Passport Offices went up considerably with the issue 
   of 22,68,425 fresh passports representing an increase of 40.4%. Detailed 
   input and output figures regarding fresh passport and miscellaneous 
   services are at Appendix VII. 
    
 <br><br>The main areas of focus during the past financial year were the further 
   improvement and simplification of passport services for which purpose 
   the following measures were introduced: 
    
   <br><br>(a) With effect from 1 November 1992, passport application forms started 
   being sold by select head and sub-post offices throughout India. A total 
   of almost 2000 new outlets for passport application forms were thereby 
   created. In view of this, as required by the Department of Posts, the 
   acceptance of passport application forms printed by travel agents was 
   discontinued from 31 March 1993 after an overlap period of five months 
   to enable them to use up their stocks. 
    
   <br><br>(b) A major difficulty faced by Indian nationals related to issue of 
   duplicate passports in lieu of lost or damaged passports. The entire 
   system has been rationalised and simplified so that an Indian who has 
   genuinely lost or damaged his passport is not deprived of a passport for 
   urgent travel, while necessary investigations and clearances are 
   obtained. Some exceptions to this facility have, however, been made in 
   certain cases in order to prevent 
   abuse of this facility. 
    
   <br><br>(c) Specified miscellaneous services, such as addition/deletion of 
   children's names, extra visa pages, etc can be granted by any Passport 
   Office. 
   -110&gt; 
    
  <br><br> In the case of renewal of passports, issue of police clearance 
   certificates and change of address, name or date of birth, the 
   applicant, if in India, should normally approach the original Passport 
   Issuing Authority (PIA). In an emergency, these services can be granted 
   by any Passport Office, after obtaining clearance from the original PIA. 
   A Mission abroad can grant these services after checking with the 
   original PIA. 
    
   <br><br>(d) With effect from July 1992, the system of recognising Travel Agents 
   for dealing with Passport Offices was dispensed with. Now all Travel 
   Agents are free to deal with Passport Offices without having to go 
   through any formality of recognition or payment of fee and the public 
   accordingly has a much greater choice instead of the limited number of 
   Travel Agents who had hitherto been recognised. 
    
   <br><br>(e) It was found that several passport applications were being received 
   in the name of non-existent persons at non-existent addresses, or 
   persons already outside India. In order to prevent passports from 
   falling into the hands of unauthorised people, w.e.f. July 1992, 
   passports in the case of first time applicants,- started being delivered 
   to the applicants themselves or posted to them. For all other cases, 
   such as renewal of passports, issue of passports after the expiry of the 
   full validity of the 10-year old passport and miscellaneous services, 
   any authorised person including any Travel Agent may deal with the 
   Passport Offices on behalf of the applicants and receive the completed 
   passport on the basis of a letter of authority from the applicant. 
    
   <br><br>(f) The Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division has a computerised 
   system of monitoring complaints received from the public both with 
   regard to delays in the issue of passports as well as complaints against 
   officials. The Divisions monitors the complaints and its intervention 
   has helped in the resolution of several cases. At the same time, 
   wherever a complaint gives reason to suspect malafide behaviour on the 
   part of any passport official or staff member, the CPV Division 
   undertakes investigation of the concerned case and action against the 
   erring official is taken, based on the investigation. Nine officials 
   were placed under suspension on various charges, sanction for 
   prosecution issued in respect of three and Departmental action taken 
   against twelve. 
    
   <br><br>(g)Passports are normally to be issued on a first-come-first- 
   served basis with reference to the date of application. All Passport 
   Offices have been instructed that when the applicant's turn comes up, if 
   the police report has not been received and a period of four weeks has 
   elapsed, 
    
    
   the passport should be issued if the application is otherwise in order. 
   Notwithstanding the above, in genuine cases of emergency supported by 
   satisfactory documentation to establish the urgency, passports are 
   issued on a priority basis. Such cases cover exporters and businessmen 
   with firm commitments, persons requiring to go abroad urgently for 
   medical treatment, people with valid employment offers from other 
   countries, officials and private individuals required to go abroad to 
   attend seminars and conferences, etc as well as students with admission 
   abroad in recognised universities or those appearing for entrance 
   examinations of foreign universities. Valid supporting documentation is 
   a must to ensure that this facility is not misused as it has been found 
   that a single passport issued out of turn delays several other cases. 
    <br>-111&gt;
   <br><br>Several administrative measures were also taken to increase the output 
   of the Passport Offices. These were particularly critical as a major 
   backlog got generated in 1991 with the unexpectedly high receipt of 
   24.03 lakh applications for fresh passports whereas issues were 16.15 
   lakhs with a supply of 16.43 lakh blank passport booklets used for both 
   fresh passports and miscellaneous services. These measures were: 
    
   <br><br>(a) Urgent steps were taken to work out a schedule of enhanced 
   deliveries with the India Security Press (ISP), Nasik which prints the 
   booklets. For 1993-94, ISP has committed itself to a supply of 40 lakh 
   booklets which should ensure that there is no shortfall vis-a-vis the 
   anticipated demand for passports. The Ministry has also welcomed a 
   Finance Ministry proposal for the establishment of a second passport 
   printing facility. 
    
   <br><br>(b)      The cadre strength of Central Passport Organization existing in 
   1991-92 was sanctioned in 1980 based on an inflow of about 13 lakh 
   applications for fresh passports received in 1979 in the then 18 
   Passport Offices. Since then the number of Passport Offices has 
   increased with no additional sanctioned strength and work has grown 
   tremendously. The cadre strength was clearly inadequate to handle the 
   increasing number of applications. In order to remedy this situation, 
   Government have sanctioned 400 additional posts in the Central Passport 
   Organization. The necessary formalities to fill these posts are in the 
   process of being completed. 
    
   <br><br>(c)      Delhi Passport Office has been partially computerised: details 
   of all passport applications received in the past two years are on a 
    
    
   computerised database. The computerisation of CPV Division is underway 
   and a number of software programmes relating to countrywide data on 
   passport receipts and issues, miscellaneous services granted by the 
   Passport Offices, cases of lost and damaged passports, complaints and 
   grievances and data on Indians arrested abroad or who have died abroad 
   as well as foreigners arrested in India or who have died in India, are 
   available on the database. The necessary sanctions for computerisation 
   of the Regional Passport Office, Bombay and for the extension of 
   computerisation in CPV Division have been issued. The work has thus far 
   been entrusted to the National Informatics Centre (NIC) which is in the 
   process of acquiring the necessary hardware. 
   <br>-112&gt; 
   <br><br>The experience of computerisation thus far has been limited but 
   extremely useful, since it has established that mere computerisation, 
   without a review and streamlining of procedures for passport issue, 
   would not result in meeting the objective of reducing delays in the 
   issue of passports. Accordingly, the' Government has initiated an 
   exercise to examine the entire system of issue of passports with a view 
   to tightening procedures and reducing delays without sacrificing 
   security considerations. 
    
   <br><br>(d) Passport fraud continues to be a problem. An inter-Ministerial group 
   is examining methods to make the passport booklet more secure and 
   resistant to tampering besides working out the plans for making the

   <br><br>To facilitate travel of Members of Parliament, Supreme Court Judges, 
   Heads of National Academic Institutions, their spouses and dependent 
   children under 18 years within the SAARC countries, SAARC stickers 
   enabling visa-free entry into all SAARC member countries were introduced 
   with effect from I March 1992. implementation of this scheme is handled 
   by the PV II Section of the CPV Division. 
    
   <br><br>A Bill to amend the Passports Act, 1967 has been passed by Parliament it 
   was passed by the Lok Sabha in December 1992 and by the Rajya Sabha 
   during the Budget Session, 1993. The Bill inter alia aims to allow the 
   Government to fix the fees for passport services commensurate with the 
   cost of such services and to increase the penalties for violations of 
   the Act. 
    
   <br><br>The CPV Division did 1,60,401 attestations in 1992. The matter of 
   charging a fee for attestation is under active consideration. 
  <br>-113&gt; 
    
   During 1992, several consular cases were handled with reference to 
   problem of Indian nationals abroad. Figures regarding various categories 
   of cases may be seen at Appendix IX 
    
   There are at present nine active extradition requests from foreign 
   countries and ten requests by India being handled by the Division. 
    
  <br><br>The responsibilities of the Division were expanded from facilitating 
   travel abroad by Indian nationals through the issue of passports and 
   providing consular assistance wherever necessary to coordinating other 
   aspects of dealings with Indians overseas. It is estimated that at 
   present there are about 10 million persons of Indian origin residing in 
   different parts of the world. This figure includes those who continue to 
   hold Indian citizenship and are the responsibility of the Government of 
   India. 
    
   <br><br>Overseas Indians are increasingly being recognised as a valuable asset 
   for India and as a useful bridge between India and the country of their 
   domicile. It is the policy of the Government of India that persons of 
   Indian origin who have taken foreign nationality should identify 
   themselves with and integrate into the mainstream of life in their 
   country of adoption. The Government, however, remains alive to their 
   general welfare and, in particular, to their cultural and economic 
   interest in India. 
    
   <br><br>Indian Missions abroad maintain close contacts with overseas Indians in 
   a wide variety of fields and render them all possible assistance with 
   the CPV &amp; OI Division acting as a nodal point in India.

   Shri Eduardo Faleiro, who took over as Minister of State for External 
   Affairs on 24 June 1991, demitted charge on 17 January 1993. Shri Salman 
   Khursheed took over as Minister of State in this Ministry on the same 
   date. 
    
   <br><br>Following Government's directive on economy, it was decided that Indian 
   Embassies in Malawi, Zaire and Colombia may be closed down. This would 
   also help offset part of the expenditure incurred on the new Missions 
   established in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Israel and the new 
   Consulates in Shanghai in China and St. Petersberg and Vladivostok in 
   Russia. In addition, the Consulate in Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, 
   has been upgraded to an Embassy. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry, therefore, now has 144 Resident Missions/Posts aborad 
   including the three slated for closure. 
    
   <br><br>There has been a major reorganization and streamlining of the work at 
   Headquarters to reflect the changes in the global scenario. Some 
   Territorial Divisions have been merged to ensure better coordination of 
   policies in the concerned area. New Divisions have also been created to 
   enable the Ministry to focus more closely on developments within the 
   region. For work of specialised nature, separate Units have been set up 
   where required. The list of Divisions is given at Appendix XVIII. 
    
   <br><br>A regular time schedule is being adhered to for holding the meetings of 
   the various Boards which recommend postings and transfers of officials 
   at all levels. Greater transparency has been introduced in the posting 
   procedures and the available posts are circulated well in advance to all 
   concerned officials at headquarters and abroad. 
  <br> -115&gt; 
   <br><br> 
   The Departmental Promotion Committees to consider promotion to various 
   grades are being convened with minimum possible delay. 
    
   <br><br>The meetings of the Joint Consultative Machinery for redressal of staff 
   grievances are also being held regularly. 
    
   <br><br>55 vacancies of Heads of Missions which arose from time to time have 
   been filled since July 1991 and periods for which Missions functioned 
   without a Head was kept to the absolute minimum. 
    
   <br><br>The total strength of IFS and IFS(B) at Headquarters and Indian Missions 
   and Posts abroad is 3396. This includes certain posts borne on the 
   budget of Ministry of Commerce but excludes ex-cadred posts and those 
   held in abeyance. In addition, 9 posts are held by ex-cadre HOMs. The 
   cadre-wise strength is at Appendix X. The list of officers qualified in 
   various foreign languages is at Appendix XII. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry continued its efforts for acquisition of properties and 
   construction of buildings for Indian Missions abroad particularly in 
   those cities where real estate market was favourable. Purchase of five 
   apartments in Washington for Indian Embassy officers was finalised. 
    
  <br><br> The Regional Passport Office, Delhi, is to move to Bhikaji Cama Place, 
   on acquisition of space in that building complex. 
    
   <br><br>Construction work in the Chancery-cum-Residence projects at Dubai and 
   Kuwait was completed during the year. Construction work in the 
   Chancerycum-Residence projects at Kuala Lumpur and New York would also 
   be completed during the year. 
    
   <br><br>Tenders for construction of Chancery-cum-Residence projects at Riyadh 
   have been floated and the tender documents for Indira Gandhi Centre for 
   Indian Culture at Port Louis are being finalised. Pre-construction 
   planning for projects at Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Islamabad Phase II, 
   Kathmandu, Kiev, Moscow, Muscat and Tashkent is on hand. 
    
   <br><br>Administrative inspections of Indian Missions in Dhaka, Canberra, 
   Sydney, Wellington, Bangkok, Cairo and Nairobi were carried out by the 
   Foreign Service Inspectors (FSIs) with the objective of reviewing and 
   improving the functioning of these Missions. Soon after the 
   establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Israel, the FSIs 
   visited Tel Aviv to set up the new Indian Mission. 
    
   <br><br>Computers have been supplied to several more Divisions in the Ministry 
   and in Missions abroad with a view to increasing efficiency.

   which included the re-modelling of programmes to acquaint participants 
   with the new economic policies, and the introduction of language courses 
   in the Basic Professional Courses which are held several times every 
   year. It also gave a thrust to inter-institutional interaction, and held 
   special programmes for diplomats from friendly foreign countries 
   requesting for training here. 
    
   <br><br>As a result, 13 diplomats from 6 newly independent Central Asian 
   countries attended the first such professional course from 30 September 
   to 30 November 1992. The programme for these diplomats included the 
   study of diplomatic practice and protocol, international law, 
   formulation and implementation of foreign policy, training in computer 
   skills, effective communication and representational skills. In their 
   efforts to set up their diplomatic services, these newly independent 
   countries had projected their requirements to the Institute or the 
   Government of India. The second professional course for diplomats 
   commenced on 18 January 1993 and had 15 diplomats from the ANC, and 11 
   others from Hungary, Romania, Kyrghyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
   Vietnam and Zambia. The training was adjusted to meet the needs of these 
   countries, as appropriate. 
    
   <br><br>Another feature was the holding of an orientation-cum-briefing programme 
   for Heads of Indian Missions and Posts. The first such programme took 
   place from 30 March to 10 April 1992. In this programme, emphasis was 
   given to the new economic policies of Government. Such programmes are 
   being planned for the future also. 
    
   <br><br>In keeping with the idea of improving FSTI's contacts with similar 
   institutes abroad, the Dean visited Mexico from 23 to 25 September 1992 
   to attend the meeting of Association of Directors of Diplomatic 
   Academies &amp; Institutes of International Relations (ADDAIIR). To further 
   this effort, delegations from Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Malaysia 
   visited the Institute during the period. Efforts are being made to widen 
   inter-institutional interaction. 
   <br>-117&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The language laboratory was set-up and made functional. It has been 
   widely used this year. 
    
  <br><br> Under a UNDP Project, one Foreign Service Officer was sent for M A 
   Degree Course in international law, diplomacy and international 
   economics to Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, for 
   the academic year 1992-93 which commenced from September 1992. 
    
  <br><br> Apart from these features, the basic functions of the FSTI continued 
   with the training of IFS Probationers and of members of staff posted 
   abroad, etc. There had been a special thrust in respect of the latter 
   towards area and language orientation, as also familiarity with 
   operating computers for word processing and Electronic Mail. A list of 
   programmes conducted is as follows: 
    
   <br><br>(i) Professional Course in Diplomacy and International Relations for IFS 
   Probationers (1991 batch) (15 participants)*

   responsibilities: implementation of Official Language Policy of the 
   Union of India at Headquarters, Regional Passport Offices located in 
   India and Indian Missions/Posts abroad, and propagation of Hindi abroad 
   through Indian Missions and Posts. The whole set of work is accomplished 
   by the Hindi Section of the Ministry. In addition, Hindi Section also 
   caters to the entire translation work from English to Hindi and vice- 
   versa of the Ministry, Passport Offices and Indian Missions/Posts 
   abroad. 
    
   <br><br>To facilitate the use of Hindi in the Ministry, its Passport offices and 
   Indian Missions abroad and also to provide guidance, where necessary, 
   there is a Hindi Advisory Committee in the Ministry. The Official 
   Language Implementation Committee, headed by Joint Secretary (Admn), is 
   working to oversee the progressive use of Hindi in the official work. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry continued with various Hindi Schemes. Workshops were 
   organized for those having working knowledge in Hindi in order to remove 
   their hesitation in doing their official work in Hindi. A Hindi Module 
   for IFS probationers of 1991 batch was also organized. A phased 
   programme has also been chalked out to organize similar workshops in 
   various Passport Offices in, India! 
    
   <br><br>During the year under review, Hindi Week was observed and various 
   Competitions were organized at the Headquarters, in some of the Indian 
   Missions abroad and also in some of the Passport Offices located in 
   India with a view to create an atmosphere conducive to use of Hindi in 
   these offices. 
   <br>-119&gt; 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry has purchased 50 Devanagari Typewriters with a view to 
   achieving the target set in the annual programme regarding 
   implementation of the Official Language Policy of the Government for the 
   year 1992-93. Passport Office, Hyderabad, whereof 80% staff possesses 
   working knowledge of Hindi, has been notified under Rule 10(4) of the 
   Official Languages Rules 1976 thereby increasing the number of notified 
   Passport Offices under this Rule to 7. Computer Cell of the Ministry has 
   also chalked out a phased programme of introducing bilingual capacity in 
   the computers installed in the Ministry. 
    
   <br><br>With a view to assessing the progress in implementation of Official 
   Language Policy of the Union in the Passport Offices, Officers from 
   Hindi Section have inspected Passport Offices located at Bhubaneshwar, 
   Patna, Calcutta, Cochin, Trivandrum, Bangalore, Madras, Calicut and 
   Tiruchirapalli. Committee of Parliament on Official Language also 
   inspected the Passport Offices in Hyderabad and Madras with the same 
   objective. 
    
   <br><br>This year too, the Ministry continued with the Rajbhasha Running Shield 
   scheme for its Passport Offices located in India to encourage them to do 
   their maximum work in Hindi. As a result, Passport Offices at Ahmedabad, 
   Bhopal, Delhi and Lucknow gave good account of themselves in this field. 
    
   <br><br>As regards propagation of Hindi abroad, sets of standard Hindi 
   literature were sent to Indian Missions abroad this year also. We 
   received demands for Hindi teaching material, Hindi books for research 
   scholars, Hindi magazines, typewriters, etc from a number of our 
   Missions abroad and requisite material was supplied to them. 
    
   <br><br>Indian Embassy in Seoul assisted the Hangkuk University in organizing a 
   Hindi essay elocution competition in which Korean Students of Hindi 
   participated with great enthusiasm. The Ministry extended help in 
   sending gift items and books for the function. Similar function was 
   organized by Indian Embassy in Paramaribo (Suriname) for which gift 
   items were again sent by the Ministry. On the special demand of Indian 
   High Commission in Georgetown books worth over Rs 2 lakh were sent to it 
   for donation to local organizations engaged in teaching of Hindi. 
    
   <br><br>The Ministry liaised between Indian Missions and the Department of 
   Education and Central Hindi Institute to ensure coordination and smooth 
   and timely execution of work related to the nomination, travel and 
   enrolments of foreign students coming to India on Government of India 
   scholarship to study Hindi at the Central Hindi Institute. 
   <br>-120&gt; 
    
   <br><br>Classes for the children of the officials of the Missions and members of 
   staff of other offices of Central Government located abroad continued to 
   be held by Indian Missions for which all suitable help was accorded. 
    
   <br><br>An encouraging picture is emerging as a result of the efforts of the 
   Ministry to propagate Hindi abroad and it is hoped that more will be 
   accomplished through sustained efforts in this direction.
