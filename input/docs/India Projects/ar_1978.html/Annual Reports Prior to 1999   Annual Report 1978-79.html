   The</a> rationale of the policy of Nonalignment, to which India 
remains firmly committed, is that it safeguarded national inde- 
pendence and offered the widest measure of opportunities for 
international cooperation and at the same time contributed towards 
constructive and peaceful resolution of world problems. 
 
 <br><br>  India had always underlined that the validity of the policy of 
Nonalignment rested on the recognition of the sovereign equality 
of nations and the right of each country to determine its own social 
and political systems and to determine freely how, on the basis of 
mutual respect, to cooperate with other nations.  The history of the 
post-war world has vindicated that every country, however small 
or weak, treasures its prerogative of independent discretion for 
internal affairs and external relations.  The notions cherished so 
confidently at one time about the inevitability of one or other 
system or ideology prevailing, or the necessity of military arrange- 
ments which impose an externally determined discipline on eco- 
nomic and social and foreign policies of nations have proved false. 
Equally unconvincing was the belief that another world conflict was 
necessarily inevitable because of the diversity of ideological sys- 
tems.  On the other hand, post-war history also shows the failure 
of great powers even when using all manner of economic and 
political persuasion, to win the genuine friendship and trust of 
small countries in the democratised and decolonised nation-state 
system. 
 
   <br><br> Whether seen in the long-term background or the developments 
in the year under review, the policy of Nonalignment has served 
the country well in safeguarding national goals and providing a 
lodestar in the turbulence of the international scene. 
 
   <br><br> It was entirely in keeping with this policy that government was 
able to resolve inherited problems, assuage unwarranted suspicions 
and create a climate of confidence with our neighbours.  A new 
respect and a greater measure of trust than in the past characterises 
the relations between India and each one of her neighbours.  There 
is a greater recognition that the corrosion of suspicion and friction 
can be overcome and on the positive side the benefits of economic 
cooperation could ease the burdens of development and create 
an atmosphere of stability so essential  for any enlightened 
national goals. 
 
 <br><br> (i) 
   <br><br>   (ii) 
 
  <br><br> The conclusion of separate Treaties of Trade and Transit with 
Nepal and the Inter-Governmental Agreement not only resolved an 
old problem but in turn has initiated the promise of industrial 
cooperation and wider economic relations between the two 
countries.  Recognising  Nepal's  problem  of  a  serious 
shortage of  rupees because of the imbalance in its trade with 
India, steps  were initiated after joint deliberations to facilitate 
setting up industries in that country which would not only generate 
employment and help its development but at the same time help 
to balance vast rupee purchases made from India.  In this climate 
of confidence, more significant steps have been taken than, in the 
previous 30 years so that the immense potential of the rivers 
which flow from Nepal can be harnessed.  Such projects could 
help inflood control and soil erosion and generate power for 
Nepal's own requirements and correspondingly reduce the pressure 
on its own forests for fuel and in turn make available the surplus 
of power to meet the energy requirements of the neighbouring 
states in India. 
 
   <br><br>With Sri Lanka also new measures have been agreed to 
promote cooperation, investment, enable a better balance in our 
trade and incidentally assist Sri Lanka in its planned develop- 
ment. 
 
   <br><br> The improved climate of relations with Bangladesh has also 
led to a spurt in trade.  There is more anticipation that cooperation 
between the two countries can develop on the basis of the logic 
of economic benefit and mutual complementarity. 
 
  <br><br> Some problems which, in the past, had disproportionately 
clouded relations with Bhutan have been resolved.  There exists 
today in the government and the people a firmer confidence in 
the common advantage of the interdependent relationship between 
India, and Bhutan. 
 
<br><br> Even when recognising that improvement  in relations have 
still a longer way to develop, with Pakistan also, there is a 
greater., measure of confidence and trust than  in the past. The 
movement of people, exchange of sports teams  and the visits of 
cultural troupes have been welcomed In both  countries. After 
years of estrangement, old friends and, relations have 
been able to travel across the frontier to meet each 
other.  Pakistan has been assured not only of strict 
adherence to non-interference but that India respects its integrity 
and would rejoice in its economic advancement.  It is hoped that 
 <br><br> (iii) 
<br><br> 
the beginnings of a new climate have been generated where both 
can mutually respond to develop more harmonious and beneficial 
neighbourly relations.  India's willingness to provide wheat seeds 
for Pakistan's requirements was a small beginning in the kind 
of cooperation which we believe can be advantageous to both 
countries.  The potentials for mutually advantageous trade are vast 
and remain to be optimised. 
 
  <br><br> The ultimate advantages of this policy of equality and 
cooperation between neighbours is that it enables the realisation 
of the optimum benefits of resources between countries which 
are linked by the permanent features of geography.  It holds the 
promise of overcoming the suspicions which have drawn in out- 
side powers to exploit and exacerbate differences between the two 
neighbours.  It is a policy which serves the vital interests of this 
country as it can, through cooperative attitudes, permit the 
development of energy and vital irrigation resources, It could 
also help to quarantine this area from the kind of turbulence 
and suspicions which exists in other regions.  If this policy continues 
to receive the positive response of our partner nations, it can 
become an example for a world order where big nations and 
small coexist in a democratised international order.  The task is 
not easy, but the alternatives of suspicion and conflict can only 
enhance insecurity and debilitate national development. 
 
<br><br>Notwithstanding the existence of the unresolved boundary 
question, the process of normalising relations with China started 
in 1976 when the Ambassadors of the two countries took up 
their posts in Peking and New Delhi respectively.  In the last 
two years, small but significant steps have been taken to facilitate 
trade and permit delegations to exchange visits, to identify the 
fields where bilateral, functional or economic cooperation could 
be of reciprocal advantage.  The Foreign Minister accepted the, 
invitation from the Chinese Foreign Minister to visit China and 
seek to explore the potential of fuller normalisation.  At no stage 
was the complexity or importance of the issues between the two 
countries sought to be minimised.  The visit itself, which was 
delayed  for a few months, was marked by exchanges on the 
basis of equality and mutual respect.  The endeavour was to 
see if some  irritants in the relations could be removed and to 
assess  whether major problems could be tackled in a climate of 
dignity and mutual respect.  The visit did lead to a full discussion 
on all  problems and there was ground for satisfaction that it 
improved understanding of each other's viewpoints.  India hopes 
that the process of normalisation of relations with China will 
   <br><br>   (iv) 
 
<br><br>continue so that outstanding problems, including the boundary 
question, can be resolved. 
 
  <br><br> In East Asia, there were significant developments during the 
year such as the normalisation of Sino-American relations and 
the Sino-Japanese Treaty.  India's economic relations with the 
countries in the region grew notably with Japan and the Republic 
of Korea.  There are grounds to believe that the climate for 
exploring increased complementarity with a technologically ad- 
vanced country like Japan has improved considerably. 
 
  <br><br>  During the year, there were promising beginnings for the 
restoration of trade and cooperative relations between ASEAN 
and Vietnam.  The process, however, received a serious setback 
after the developments in Kampuchea.  The situation became even 
more serious with the deterioration of relations between Vietnam 
and China culminating in the massive attack into Vietnam by 
Chinese forces.  Consistent with our respect for the principle of 
territorial integrity, India could not but deplore this action.  India 
has affirmed that the integrity and the national sovereignty and 
independent personality of Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos, like 
those of all nations, must be respected, so that the search towards 
regional cooperation and stability in South-East Asia could be 
resumed. 
 
  <br><br>  There was notable improvement in India's bilateral relations 
with the countries of South-East Asia during the year under 
review.  All the countries belong to the Nonaligned fraternity of 
nations.  India became the first developing country to seek a 
dialogue with the ASEAN group of nations.  During the year a 
new beginning was made in establishing bilateral economic rela- 
tions with Vietnam.  India responded with great sympathy and 
understanding towards Vietnam in its immense task of reconstruc- 
ting its shattered economy. 
 
<br><br>The year saw dramatic changes in Afghanistan and in Iran. 
Since these were internal changes, India recognised the new 
regimes with alacrity.  Further it was made clear that India looked 
forward to continue and intensify these traditional relations.  The 
importance of South-West Asia, with its vast oil surplus, is crucial 
to the world economy.  India looks forward to the establishment 
of stability where countries can fashion their social and political 
structures and forge their economic links by choice without the 
need for guardianship of any outside powers. 
<br><br>  (v) 
 
   <br><br>India followed the efforts to establish peace between Egypt 
and Israel.  India would welcome a peaceful solution for the 
problems of West Asia but has not hesitated to make clear that 
a settlement could only prove durable if it is comprehensive and 
just, ensures Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories 
and enables the fulfilment of the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinians. 
 
   <br><br>In Africa, there were many continuing conflicts as well as 
new ones:  e.g., Western Sahara, Somalia and Ethopia, 
Uganda and Tanzania.  India could not but regret these conflicts 
between Nonaligned states and urged that solutions should be 
found with the help of OAU based on the principles of respect 
for established frontiers.  The situation in Southern Africa became 
more serious and dangerous.  Both in Namibia and Zimbabwe, 
the struggle for majority rule was sought to be undermined and 
delayed by racist minority regimes.  While still hoping for a 
peaceful solution, it must be noted with regret that the likelihood 
of a more intensified armed struggle seems to have become un- 
avoidable.  India has pledged both moral and material support 
in liberation struggles for majority rule in Namibia and Zimbabwe 
and for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa 
 
 <br><br>   Throughout the year, the atmosphere of relations between 
the two Super Powers was somewhat tense.  The SALT II agree- 
ment which both of them. seemed to set store by has so far 
eluded conclusion.  The prospect of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
receded even further.  Though the Helsinki process had appeared 
to have set the stage in promoting mutual confidence between 
East and West, the results of the second CSCE Conference in 
Belgrade proved disappointing, if not insubstantial. 
 
  <br><br>  On the other hand and despite a more surcharged atmosphere, 
India's own bilateral relations with the USA and the USSR were 
uncontaminated by the cold war spirit which complicated the 
international scene.  Even when differences existed on specific 
issues, the climate of relations was friendly and propitious for 
continuing improvement.  To the already confident and multistran- 
ded long established relations with the USSR, the year under 
review saw the addition of a far-reaching agreement for long-term 
economic cooperation.  The problem of obtaining fuel supplies 
from the USA for the nuclear reactor in Tarapur remained un- 
solved.  However, the dialogue on this and the wider question of 
non-discriminatory nuclear safeguards has been continuing bet- 
ween the two governments. 
  (vi) 
 
  <br><br> India's relations with the countries of Europe, both east and 
west, continued at a friendly level, with increasing attention being 
given  to the exploration of economic cooperation for mutual 
benefit.  The impending structural changes in the EEC were noted 
and special efforts were made for closer relations with the 
Community. 
 
 <br><br>   India has worked to preserve the unity and cohesive purpose- 
fulness of the Nonaligned movement which now represents nearly 
two-thirds of the membership of the United Nations.  Similarly, 
in the North-South dialogue and in the search for the establish- 
ment of a new International Economic Order, India has sought 
to play a responsible, constructive and bridge-building role.  In 
this task, the Ministry was alive to requirements of coordination 
with other departments of Government. 
 
 <br><br>   India's commitment to the goal of general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control was 
fully reflected in our active participation in the Tenth Special 
Session of the United Nations General Assembly held in the 
summer of 1978.  The Prime Minister addressed the session and 
called for a meaningful programme of action, particularly in the 
area of nuclear disarmament, to which we attach the highest 
priority.  India also participated actively in the other forums of 
the United Nations in this field and, in particular, in the newly 
created deliberative and negotiating bodies, namely, the 
Disarmament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament. 
 
 <br><br>  India expressed its serious concern at the suspension of the 
US/USSR talks on the Indian Ocean and repeatedly urged the 
two powers to resume the talks.  At the United Nations, India 
participated in all the meetings related to the implementation of 
the UN Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace by 
eliminating from the Indian Ocean the manifestation of foreign 
military presence conceived in the context of Great Power rivalry. 
 
 <br><br>   As in the previous year, India played ail active role in the 
deliberations of the UN Human Rights Commission and other 
international forums dealing with Various aspects in the field of 
Human Rights.  The Government of India took a very important 
step in the practical demonstration of its commitment to Human 
Rights by deciding to accede to the two important Covenants 
covering civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
 
<br><br>The chapters which follow contain a factual summary of 
India's relations with other countries during the year and the 
  (vii) 
 
<br><br>exchange of visits which contributed to the promotion of these 
relations.  Based on the strength which comes from the democratic 
institutions and the strides made in our economic: progress, India 
has reasons for confidence that it can maintain and develop 
relations of cooperation and dignity with the developing and the 
developed nations.  Guided by the touchstone of beneficial bilatera- 
lism, the last year saw a great increase in the scope and dimension 
of India's relations.  Wherever such sinews of cooperation have 
been forged, it has contributed towards stabilising relations and 
catalysing greater measure of mutual confidence.  The spirit of 
this policy of independence and positively motivated search for 
friendship is in keeping with the spirit of tolerance and the pacific 
tradition of our nation and civilization.  India poses a throat to no 
country.  Equally, it hopes it commands growing understanding 
and respect from all members of the international community and 
thus can be looked upon as a bulwark for international peace and 
stability.

INDIA'S NEIGHBOURS <br><br>
 
   India's relations with its neighbours measurably improved 
during the period. India's policy of beneficial bilateralism, 
meaningful cooperation, non-interference in internal affairs and 
goodwill has created a general atmosphere of confidence and 
trust in the region. 
 
  <br><br> India was among the first to recognise the new government 
in Afghanistan.  The official visit of the Minister of External 
Affairs to Kabul, in September 1978, preceded by the Foreign 
Secretary's discussions there in June, established a personal 
equation with the new leadership in Afghanistan.  The Indo- 
Afghan Joint Commission for Economic, Trade and Technical 
Cooperation met in Delhi in January 1979 for a mid-term review 
of the progress in the carrying out of various  projects. The 
review led to a decision whereby India agreed to finance a 
number of new projects in Afghanistan. 
 <br><br>
<br><br>India continued to work with some success towards improved 
relations with Bangladesh.  We supported the successful candida- 
ture of Bangladesh for a seat in the U.N. Security Council. 
The visits of the Bangladesh Commerce Minister.  Mr. Saifur 
Rahman in July 1978, and of the Foreign Minister, Mr. Shamsul 
Haque in  December 1978 in that connection provided an 
opportunity for a broad exchange of views between the two 
governments on, bilateral matters and international issues. The 
Foreign Minister repeatedly testified to the improved climate of 
relations. 
  <br><br> However, certain problems remain to be resolved.  Regular 
meetings of the Border Security Forces of the two countries have 
helped to ease problems connected with the border.  But they 
did not put an end to the continued illicit migration from 
Bangladesh to India.  The Joint River Commission held two 
meetings during the year.  Long term augmentation of the flow 
of the river Ganga during the dry season was discussed, but 
there was little progress towards agreement.  A Joint Committee 
was set up to prepare data with a view to working out an 
agreement on the waters of river Teesta.  Other committees are 
<br><br>pg2<br><br>
 
studying problems connected with other border rivers.  Dis- 
cussions were held regarding maritime boundary and a further 
meeting is expected to be held in this connection in the near 
future. 
 
 <br><br>  Economic cooperation between the two countries continued 
to make some improvement.  A credit agreement was signed by 
the Industrial Development Bank of India to supply to 
Bangladesh capital goods worth Rs. 12 crores.  India also 
agreed to give to Bangladesh products access to the Indian 
market, and to provide technical assistance in various agricul- 
tural fields and techno-economic studies in certain industrial 
areas.  A number of meetings took place to consider improving 
transport facilities between the two countries and a Memorandum 
of understanding was signed to help towards overland transit 
traffic between Nepal and Bangladesh. India also continued 
to provide a large number of scholarships and other training 
facilities to  nationals of  Bangladesh. It is our hope and 
expectation that following the parliamentary elections, the pace 
of increasing cooperation and also resolving problems will 
become speedier. 
 
   <br><br> India continued to develop friendly relations through high- 
level contacts and by extending assistance to Bhutan for its 
development plans.  The visit of the King of Bhutan to India 
in March 1978 highlighted the bonds of friendship and the 
spirit of trust and confidence that governed India's relations 
with that country. 
 
  <br><br> Apart from the visit of King of Bhutan, India's Ministers 
of Energy and Finance visited that country in April and May 
respectively while three delegations from Bhutan visited India 
under the Indo-Bhutan cultural exchange programme. 
 
 <br><br>  The Government of India committed itself to  contribute 
approximately Rs. 70 crores for the  Fourth Five Year 
development plan of Bhutan.  Apart from this expenditure, India 
is contributing to the construction of a major hydro-electric 
project on a grant-cum-loan basis at Chukha.  Expected to be 
completed in mid-1980s, this would develop 332MW of power. 
India is also assisting Bhutan in the construction of a cement 
project at Penden which is estimated to cost Rs. 12.75 crores 
and expected to commence production in early 1979.  India 
is also implementing a comprehensive allied irrigation scheme 
in the town of Gaylegphug meant to provide the inhabitants 
  <br><br>pg3<br><br>
 
of the area with extensive irrigation facilities for agriculture and 
allied purposes. 
 
<br><br>India continued to give assistance to Bhutan for building and 
creating a viable infra-structure for its foreign trade and letters 
were exchanged to facilitate exports from and imports to 
Bhutan. 
 
<br><br>Apart from providing assistance for Bhutan's development 
plans and economic  diversification, India provided  Bhutan 
experts in various fields for its development.  Further, it helped 
Bhutanese students by providing assistance  through scholar- 
ships to undertake advanced studies in various institutions in 
India. 
 
<br><br> India looked forward to developing closer relations in all 
fields with Burma. A Burmese economic delegation led by 
Col.  Sein Tun, Minister for Cooperatives, visited India during 
September 1978.  They were assured that India is prepared to 
help Burma in its economic development through the transfer 
of technology, skills and  equipment  required by  Burma. 
Bilateral trade was also discussed and it was agreed to exchange 
information on each other's Five Year Plan which could help 
in their effective implementation.  The visit of the Minister of 
State for External Affairs, Shri Samarendra Kundu, to Burma in 
January 1979 further demonstrated India's policy of promoting 
friendly relations with its neighbours.  During his visit there were 
discussions, particularly relating to cooperation  between the 
two countries in the field of agriculture, science and technology 
and culture.  An air transport agreement between India and 
Burma was also signed during the same time. 
 
  <br><br> India and the Maldives maintained friendly relations.  The 
Minister of Transport and President elect Mr. Abdul Gayoom 
visited India in October 1978 and held discussions regarding 
bilateral air agreement and other matters connected with 
tourism and civil aviation.  The visit of the Foreign Minister of 
Maldives in December 1978 reflected development of closer 
ties.  There was some increase in trade and economic cooperation 
between Maldives and India. Economic  assistance is  being 
extended for the development plant of Maldives and we are 
taking steps to enlarge and systematise our efforts in the future. 
 
<br><br>The signing of separate treaties of trade and transit and the 
inter-governmental  agreement on  cooperation  to  control 
unauthorised trade in March 1978 created a favourable climate 
<br><br>  pg4<br><br> 
 
for promoting mutually beneficial cooperation between  India 
and Nepal.  The visit of the Nepalese Prime Minister, Shri Kirti 
Nidhi Bishta, in April 1978 resulted in an agreement whereby 
the two countries were to cooperate in setting up joint industrial 
ventures in Nepal, the produced of which could be marketed 
in India. Concrete proposals in this regard were  finalised 
through the signing of a memorandum of understanding during 
the visit of Shri George Fernandes, Minister of Industry, to 
Kathmandu in September 1978.  It inter alia provided that India 
would help in setting up industrial ventures in a number of 
fields and that India would extend assistance to Nepal worth 
Rs. 9 crores to be utilised in the next couple of years for 
setting up industrial estates,  technical  training  institutes, 
polytechnic etc. 
 
  <br><br> The visit of the Minister of External Affairs to Kathmandu 
in October 1978 marked the normal practice of the two 
countries of holding periodic consultations to discuss bilateral 
and international problems.  It was agreed to upgrade the Kosi 
Joint Coordination Committee to be presided over at the level 
of Ministers of the two countries and a meeting of experts 
would be held to consider setting up of flood warning stations 
in Nepal to implement measures for flood control. 
 
<br><br>India continued to extend financial and technical assistance 
for development programmes in  Nepal. An  amount of 
Rs. 10.904 crores was provided during the  current year for 
meeting expenditure on schemes on hand.  The major projects 
for which assistance was given were : (1) the 302KM long 
central sector of Mahinder Raj Marg expected to be completed 
by 1980-81 at an estimated cost of Rs. 44.36 crores; and 
(2) the 14.1MW Devighat hydroelectric project which was 
estimated to cost Rs. 30 crores and the work on which was 
commenced during the year.  India also agreed to extend 
financial assistance for the expansion of a  number of other 
projects including the Patan industrial estate and  expansion 
of Paropakar maternity  hospital and area  survey of the 
alignment of the Dolalghat-Dhankuta road. 
 
  <br><br> India in pursuance of its policy of promoting friendship 
with the neighbouring countries worked for normalisation of 
relations with Pakistan.  The visit in April 1978 of Mr. Agha 
Sham, the Adviser on Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, was notable 
for the signature of an agreement on the Salal Hydro-Electric 
project; a problem that  had remained  unresolved for eight 
<br><br> pg5<br><br>
 
years.  Ideas were also exchanged regarding promotion of trade, 
repatriation of detenus, and liberalisation of trade facilities 
There was normal travel by road, rail and air between the two 
countries and the  situation on the common border also 
continued to be undisturbed.  The decision to open Consulates 
General in each other's country is intended to facilitate travel 
and commercial contacts  between the two  countries  and 
contribute to further normalisation of their relations. 
 
<br><br> Trade teams of India and Pakistan met twice in 1978 to 
review the Trade Agreement of 1975.  As a result of the talks, 
it was agreed that pending finalisation of a new Trade Agree- 
ment, trade on Pakistan's side would continue to be conducted 
through public agencies while on the Indian side both private 
and public sectors would participate in commercial transactions. 
 
 <br><br>  Contacts between the  representatives of the two countries 
in various fields led to greater cooperation between the two 
countries.  As a result of the meeting of the, Ministers of Food 
and Agriculture of the two countries, an agreement was reached 
in September 1978 whereby India was to provide 5270 tonnes 
of wheatseeds to Pakistan.  As a result of periodic discussions 
between the concerned  authorities the two  countries  co- 
ordinated locust control activities along the border.  A delega- 
tion of officials of the Pakistani Central Board of Revenue 
visited India in January 1979 for discussions with the Indian 
Central Board of Excise and Customs.  The two countries 
decided to cooperate with each other to prevent smuggling 
across the border. 
 
<br><br> The cultural exchanges between the two countries included 
visits of some Pakistani poets and singers to India, the playing 
of Hockey matches against each other in India and Pakistan 
and a visit of the Indian Cricket team to Pakistan after a lapse 
of 17 years. 
 
<br><br>Conscious of the humanitarian  aspects involved,  India 
realeased 460 Pakistani detenus during the year while Pakistan 
released 115 Indian detenus held in Pakistan.  Efforts are 
continuing to get all the remaining detenus released as early as 
possible. 
 
  <br><br> The visit of President Jayawardane to India in October 
1978 and that of the Prime Minister Shri Morarji Desai to 
Sri Lanka in February 1979 reflected the warmth and cordiality 
that govern the relations between the two  countries. It was 
 
6 EA/78--2 
<br><br>  pg6<br><br>
 
recognised by both sides that there were no longer any 
outstanding problems between the two countries.  During the 
visit of the President of Sri Lanka, it was agreed that India 
and Sri Lanka should increase bilateral trade and  further 
economic cooperation.  During the visit of the Indian Prime 
Minister, India agreed to facilitate joint ventures in Sri Lanka 
and specially in the Colombo free-trade-zone.  The Commerce 
Ministries of the two countries agreed that greater efforts should 
be made to promote trade, and concrete measures are being 
taken to ensure greater access for Sri Lanka's  products to 
Indian markets.  The working of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement 
on the future of the people of Indian origin in Sri Lanka, was 
also reviewed and India decided to streamline the procedure 
for the repatriation and rehabilitation of the people of Indian 
origin under that agreement.<br><br> pg7<br><br>

 <br><br>
SOUTH-EAST ASIA 
 
<br><br>India took steps to strengthen relations with the countries 
of  South-East Asia through some notable high-level visits and 
signing of specific bilateral agreements with the countries of the 
region in economic, technical and cultural fields.  It also took 
initiative to seek dialogue with the Association of the South- 
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for cooperation in various fields 
and discussions towards this end were held with the Secretary- 
General of the ASEAN Secretariat who visited New Delhi 
in November 1978. 
 
   <br><br>The visit of Shri Mohan Dharia, Minister of Commerce, 
to Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, marked another step taken 
by India to develop closer economic ties with these countries. 
During his visit he presided over a Conference of India's Trade 
Representatives in South-East and  South-East Asia held in 
Singapore from May 30, 1978 31 May 1978.  He stressed on the need for 
greater trade and economic cooperation between India and the 
countries of South-East Asia.  A trade agreement was signed 
with Indonesia during the visit. 
 
<br><br>India's  close  ties with  Malaysia received an  impetus 
following the visit of the Malaysian Prime Minister Mr. Dato 
Hussein Bin On from 20--25 January 1979.  The visit resulted 
in the signing of an agreement on technical and economic 
cooperation and exchange of letters that provided for extradition 
of fugitive criminals between the two countries.  An agreement 
on Technical and Economic Cooperation provided for the 
setting up of a consultative machinery to step up cooperative 
efforts towards enlarging the areas of mutual cooperation and 
sharing skills and know-how for mutual development.  Earlier, 
during the visit of the Foreign Minister of Malaysia in March 
a cultural agreement was signed between the two countries. 
The Foreign Secretary, Shri Jagat Mehta led the Indian 
delegation to the Annual Bilateral Talks between India and 
Malaysia held in Kuala Lumpur in December 1978. 
<br><br>  pg8 
 
<br><br>There was significant development in  India's  economic 
relations with Malaysia. India's total import from  Malaysia 
rose to Rs. 202.23 crores during 1977-78.  India had 28 joint 
ventures, the largest number in any country, functioning in 
Malaysia during the year. 
 
<br><br>Exchange of a number of visits at high-levels reflected India's 
close ties with Singapore.  The Deputy Prime Minister and the 
Defence Minister of Singapore.  Dr. Goh Keng Swee visited India 
in January-February 1978 and the Foreign Minister of Singapore 
Mr. S. Rajaratnam stopped-over New Delhi in July on his way 
to Belgrade to exchange views before the holding of the Conference 
of Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers.  The foreign Secretary, 
Shri Jagat Mehta visited Singapore in November 1978.  But the 
most notable event was the visit of the Prime Minister of 
Singapore Mr. Lee Kuan Yew to India in December 1978. 
Besides international issues, there was discussion on ways and 
means of strengthening India's economic ties with number of 
countries of ASEAN in general and Singapore in particular.  It 
was noted that the already existing wide-range co-operation 
between the two countries could be expanded especially in the 
fields of trade, investment and transfer of technology. 
 
<br><br>An agreement on the avoidance of double taxation between 
India and Singapore was signed in February 1.979. Though India 
does not have much trade with Singapore, there has been a 
recent spurt in India's purchases from Singapore, particularly farm 
oil and this has turned the balance of trade in favour of Singapore. 
Three Indian export-oriented joint ventures had gone into produc- 
tion in Singapore. 
 
<br><br>India's friendly relations with Thailand were marked by the 
signing of a seabed boundary agreement with that country by the 
Foreign Minister of Thailand Dr. Upadit Pachariyangkun who 
visited India in June 1978, and the visit of the Deputy Prime 
Minister of Thailand, Mr. Sunthorn Honglabaron.  Other visits 
exchanged between India and Thailand included the visit of 
Shri S. S. Barnala, Minister of Agriculture to Bangkok in July, 
that of Shri Jagat Mehta, the Foreign Secretary in December 1978 
and of Shri Samrendra Kundu, the Minister of State for External 
Affairs in February 1979. 
 
<br><br>There are a number of Indo-Thailand joint ventures operating 
in Thailand and Indian firms are successfully competing for in- 
dustrial production in that country.  Indo-Thai trade is in favour 
of India.  Indian exports being worth US $30 million and imports 
about US $5 million annually. 
<br><br>  pg9<br><br>
 
   The visit of the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri S. 
Kundu from 27-31 January 1979 to the Philippines helped to 
further co-operation between the two countries.  In the discussions 
held during the visit both countries agreed on the desirability of 
increasing bilateral co-operation and exchanges in the fields of 
Commerce and culture. 
 
<br><br>Trade with the Philippines in 1977-78 was very much in 
India's favour.  There are four Indian joint ventures in  the 
country.  The Rail India Technical and Economic Services 
(RITES), the Fertilizers Corporation of India and the Water 
and Power Development  Consultancy  Services  Limited 
(WAPCOS) have undertaken projects in that country.  India has 
exported large number of railway coaches and wagons to the 
Philippines.  In the field of agriculture, Indian scientists have 
continued to be associated with the International Institute for 
Agricultural Research in Los Banos. 
 
 <br><br> India continued to maintain friendly relations with Indonesia 
and worked for co-operation with that country in various fields. 
The signing of the India-Thailand-Indonesia agreement on the 
determination of tri-junction points of the seabed  boundaries 
reflected a co-operative approach on the part of the countries 
in settling their problems. Discussions during the visit of  the 
Foreign Minister of Indonesia to India in November for 
annual  bilatral  talks  revealed  close  identity  of  views 
and the two countries could broaden and deepen their co-opera- 
tion in the fields of agriculture, forestry, science and technology. 
The visit of the Indonesian Chief of Staff Genl Widodo to India 
in January 1979 and that of Minister of Industry Mr. A. R. 
Soehoed in February 1979 indicated some other fields where 
the two countries were maintaining close contacts with each 
other. 
 
 <br><br>  In the economic sphere, the Federation of Indian Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry signed an agreement with its Indo- 
nesian counterpart KADIM in August 1978 for the establish- 
ment of a Joint Business Council.  A delegation of the Asso- 
ciated Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Calcutta, also 
visited Indonesia in December 1978.  India proposes to arrange 
a wholly Indian engineering exhibition in Djakarta in March 
1979. 
 
 <br><br> Industrial co-operation assuming increasing proportion in the 
economic relations of the two countries there are seven industrial 
joint ventures now in operation in Indonesia.  Public Sector 
<br><br>  pg10<br><br>
 
organisations like Water and Power Development Consultancy 
Services (RITES) Limited, the Engineers India Limited, the 
Metrological and Engineering Consultancy (India) Limited 
(MECON) have taken active interest in Indonesian programme 
of economic development. 
 <br><br>
   Friendly contacts were maintained with Vietnam through 
exchange of a number of visits at a high level.  The most signi- 
ficant visit was that of the Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister 
of Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen Duy Trinh, during December 1978. 
During the visit, both sides expressed satisfaction at the pace of 
development of bilateral ties between the two countries and 
measures were discussed to improve them and expand 
co-operation in various fields.  It was agreed that estab- 
lishment of regional co-operation in South-East Asia and South 
Asia would be mutually beneficial.  The cultural exchange pro- 
gramme signed in February 1978 gave an impetus to cultural 
relations between the two countries.  An Indian ballet group visit- 
ed Vietnam in July 1978.  A 9-member delegation sponsored 
by the Indo-Vietnamese Friendship Association and led by 
Shri Madhu Limaye, Member of Parliament, made a goodwill 
visit to Vietnam in November 1978.  From the Vietnamese side, 
a two-member journalists  delegation came to India in 
December 1978/January 1979. 
 
<br><br>India maintained friendly ties with Laos.  It gifted textiles, 
irrigation pumps and medicines worth Rs. 30 lakhs during the: 
year to that country and also sent experts to make field studies 
for setting up a pumping station in the Vientiane area. 
 
<br><br>There were increasing contacts with  Australia through 
exchange of visits of parliamentary delegations and other promi- 
nent leaders.  The Leader of Opposition in the Australian Parlia- 
ment, Mr. W. G. Hayden, came to India in June 1978.  A former 
Australian High Commissioner in India and presently the Defence 
Secretary of Australia, Sir Arthur Tange, visited India  in 
January 1979.  The Australian Minister for Special Trade Re- 
presentations, Mr. R. V. Garland, came to India in August, 1978 
to attend the ESCAP Trade Ministers' Conference.  During his 
stay be also met the Minister of Commerce, Shri Mohan Dharia. 
In November 1978, India also hosted the Chief of the General 
Staff of the Australian Army, Lt.  Gen.  D. B. Dunstan. 
 
  <br><br> The 10th round of Indo-Australian bilateral talks was held 
in Canberra.  Trade between India and Australia is increasing 
gradually, though India's share of global Australian trade remains 
small. 
<br><br>  pg11
 
<br><br>The most notable was the visit of Australian Prime Minister, 
Mr. M. Fraser to India in January 1979.  It underlined India's 
developing closer ties with that country and the warm personal 
rapport established between the Prime Minister of India and 
and the Prime Minister of Australia following the Commonwealth 
Conference held in Australia in February 1978.  Discussions held 
during the visit stressed that co-operation between India and 
Australia could help towards creating an atmosphere of stability 
in South and South-East Asian region.  It was recognised that 
there could be further co-operation between India and Australia in 
various fields and practical methods for further co-operation parti- 
cularly in science, technology, trade, energy and related areas 
could be discussed by officials of the two countries.  It was agreed 
that an Indian mission would visit Australia to explore possibilities 
of setting up joint ventures for exploitation and production of 
coking coal in that country. 
 
 <br><br>  The traditional friendly ties with New Zealand continued to 
grow on a friendly and co operative basis.  The Foreign Secretary, 
Shri Jagat Mehta, paid a visit to Wellington in February 1978 and 
met his counterpart in the New Zealand Foreign Office.  The New 
Zealand Minister of Broadcasting, Statistics and Internal Re- 
venues, Mr. H. C. Templeton, who came to India to attend the 
ESCAP Conference of Trade Ministers in New Delhi in August 
had discussions with various Ministers. 
 
  <br><br> An official trade delegation visited New Zealand  in 
December 1978 to discuss ways and means of accelerating 
bilateral trade. 
 
  <br><br> India and Fiji continued to have warm and close relations. 
In February 1978, the Foreign Secretary, Shri Jagat Mehta, 
visited Fiji and met the Governor General, the Acting Prime 
Minister and other Cabinet Ministers and held extensive dis- 
cussions on subjects of mutual interest.  Mr. Vivekanand 
Sharma, the Fijian Minister for Youth and Sports, who visited 
India in March-April also met the Minister of External Affairs. 
Another prominent visitor from Fiji was Col.  P. F. Manueli, 
the Commander of the Royal Fijian Military Forces, who came 
to India in January 1979. 
 
<br><br>It has been agreed to supply equipment worth about Rs. 10 
lakhs to the Fiji Institute  of Technology  for setting up an 
Agricultural Wing at the Ban Technical Centre.  This is the 
first time that India has committed itself to assist Fiji in a pro- 
ject of this dimension. 
<br><br>  pg12<br><br>
 
   The Minister of Trade, Mr. Pita Lees, came to India in 
October 1978 to attend a Conference of the International Silk 
Association held in Bangalore.  After the Conference, he 
visited Delhi and familiarised himself with various small-scale 
industries in and around the capital. 
 
<br><br>Congratulatory messages were sent by our Prime Minister 
to the Prime Ministers of Solomon Islands and Tuvalu on these 
countries achieving their independence on 7th July, 1978 and 
10 October, 1978 respectively.  Relations with Tonga and 
Naura continued to be warm and cordial.

MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS <br><br>
 
(East Asia Division) <br><br>
 
EAST ASIA 
 
<br><br>Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Minister for External Affairs, 
visited China from Feb 12, 1979 to 18th February 1979, This visit, 
which was in response to an invitation  from the Chinese 
Foreign Minister, extended about a year ago, was originally 
fixed for October/November 1978, but had to be postponed 
because of the Foreign Minister's indisposition.  While accept- 
ing the invitation the Foreign Minister made it clear that it was 
an exploratory mission  consistent with India's policy of non- 
alignment and quest for improved relations with all her neigh- 
bours, without jeopardising well-established friendships. 
 
  <br><br> The discussions which the Foreign Minister had with China's 
Premier Hua Guofeng, Vice Premier Deng Xiaping and the 
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua were based firmly on 
these fundamental principles of India's foreign policy. 
 
   <br><br>In an atmosphere marked by frankness and cordiality the 
two sides discussed the international situation, the situation in 
and around the Indian sub-contient and most important the 
issues affecting India-China bilateral relations. 
 
<br><br>While explaining the steps taken by India to create climate 
of confidence between nations South of Himalayas on the basis 
of scrupulous non-interference in internal affairs of other coun- 
tries, the Foreign Minister made it clear that while India does 
not object to normal bilateral relations between Pakistan and 
China, the prospects of improvement of India-China rela- 
tions would be impeded if their relations adversely affect 
India's  legitimate  interests.  He  also  pointed  out  that 
the attitude on the Kashmir question taken by Chinese Govern- 
ment, which contrasted with the stand they themselves had 
 
 
<br><br>  <pg14> 
 
taken in the 50s was an additional and unnecessary complica- 
tion in the Sino-Indian relations.  In this context he reiterated 
India's concern at the construction of the Karakoram Highway. 
 
   As far as the bilateral relations are concerned, the Foreign 
Minister in his discussions with the Chinese leaders empha- 
sised that the satisfactory solution of the India-China boun- 
dary question was vital to the restoration of confidence and 
full normalisation in the climate of Sino-Indian relations.  The 
discussions held in Peking succeeded in unfreezing the issue and 
led to the understanding that there should be further reflection 
on the possible ways of resolving this crucial question.  It was 
agreed that tranquility should be maintained along the border. 
 
   On the question of Chinese assistance to disaffected elements 
from Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur, the Chinese leaders 
stated that the support which may have been given earlier was 
looked upon as a thing of the past. 
 
   The Foreign Minister also expressed the  hope that the 
Chinese Government would consider facilitating pilgrimages to 
Kailash and Mansrover. 
 
<br><br>The two sides also reviewed the bilateral functional 
exchanges which had taken place since the return of  their 
respective Ambassadors in 1976 and explored the possibility of 
further exchanges in various fields of mutual benefit. 
 
<br><br>The Foreign Minister was in Hangchow after completion of 
his talks in Peking when he received the news about the Chinese 
attack on Vietnam on 17th February.  He decided to cut short 
his visit and returned to India immediately. 
 
<br><br>The Indian Government has expressed in unequivocal terms 
its opposition to Chinese invasion of Vietnam and has called 
for withdrawal of Chinese troops. 
 
   During the last year there have been a number of exchanges 
where experts of both countries have visited each other's coun- 
tries under the aegis of Study Tours/Conferences sponsored by 
international organisations.  Such exchanges ranged over fields 
of agriculture, health,  medicine,  broadcasting,  international 
trade etc.  In the bilateral context also there have been  a 
number of exchanges in the field of trade and commerce, 
culture, sports etc.  An Indian dance ensemble visited China in 
<br><br>  <pg15> 
 
November/December 1978 and had a highly successful perfor- 
mance tour of certain major Chinese cities.  In addition, an 
Indian journalists' delegation, a delegation of FICCI and re- 
presentatives of certain public sector undertakings visited China 
during the year.  In the reverse direction there was the visit 
of a delegation of the Chinese People's Association for Friend- 
ship with Foreign Countries led by H. E. Mr. Wang Pingnan 
in February-March 1978 and a visit to Indian agricultural re- 
search establishments by a five-member delegation of Chinese 
agricultural scientists in September-October 1978.  China also 
participated in the Seventh International Film Festival in India 
through the screening of films. 
 
<br><br>The desire of India and Japan to maintain high-level contacts 
found expression in the inauguration of the institution of annual 
consultations at the level of the Foreign Ministers with the visit 
of our Foreign Minister to Tokyo in August 1978.  The talks 
covered a wide range of bilateral and international issues and 
gave the two sides a valuable opportunity to gain deeper insights 
into their respective policies and perspectives.  As the visit 
happened to take place immediately after the signing of the 
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the Foreign 
Minister expressed the hope that the Treaty would contribute 
to the maintenance of peace and stability and will not become 
the cause of any new tensions in the region.  Further, as 
Foreign Minister stated in the Parliament on his return from 
Tokyo, "our hope is that it is implemented in a manner which 
removes misgiving expressed in certain quarters". 
 
<br><br>Japan continues to be a major economic partner of India. 
In token of its continuing interest in India's economic develop- 
ment, Japan has kept up a significant level of credits for deve- 
lopmental purposes besides resuming grant aid in the field of 
culture and socioeconomic development.  Japan is our second 
largest trading partner.  But some recent trends in the global iron 
ore market have been a source of concern.  This and other 
related matters were taken up at bilateral trade talks held in 
Tokyo, with the Commerce Secretary leading the  Indian 
delegation. 
<br><br> Several eminent non-official Japanese from various walks of 
life visited India during the year under review. 
 
<br><br>During the year India's relations with the Republic of Korea 
(South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
continued to be very good.  We have consistently advocated 
<br><br> pg16<br><br>
 
peaceful re-unification of Korea  through  bilateral discussions 
without outside interference.  The Minister for External Affairs 
visited ROK in August 1978 and a Government-Parliamentary 
Delegation led by the Minister for Parliamentary and Labour 
Affairs attended the 30th Anniversary celebrations of the 
establishment of the D.P.R.K. 
 
 <br><br>  An eight-Member Indian Parliamentary Delegation led by 
Shri Ravindra Varma, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and 
labour, visited the Mongolian People's Republic from the 13th 
to the 18th September,  1978, at the invitation of the Great 
People's Hural. The Delegation was accorded a very warm 
welcome. The Delegation  had talks and discussions with 
the representatives of the Great People's Hural and leaders of 
the Mongolian Parliamentary Groups; the Delegation called on 
Sampliyn Jalan-Ajav, Deputy Chairman of the Presidium, 
J. Batmunkh, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, N. Luvsan- 
chultem,  Chairman of the Great  People's Hural and 
M. Dugersuran, Minister of Foreign Affairs.  During their talks, 
the two sides lauded the close and cordial relations between 
the two countries and commended their mutual understanding 
and co-operation in the international fora.  It was felt that the 
close relations between the two countries would continue to 
grow in the years to come.

CHAPTER IV <br><br>
 
WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA 
 
<br><br>India continued to show keen interest in the developments 
in  West Asia and North Africa and worked for developing 
greater contacts and exchanges, on a bilateral basis with the 
countries of the region in order to promote cooperation in political, 
economic and other fields.  India noted the dramatic changes 
that took place in the region as a result of the Camp David 
Agreements between Egypt and Israel, It was India's belief 
that a comprehensive solution of the West Asian problem could 
only be possible on the basis of a unified stand by the Arab 
States and that a durable peace could be achieved only with the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied 
by it and by the restoration to the Palestinian people of their 
right to self-determination and to a State of their own. 
 
  <br><br> On the bilateral level, exchange of visits between the leaders 
of India and those of a number of countries of the region 
provided opportunities for discussions on ways and means of 
promoting closer cooperation in various fields.  The visit of 
President Assad of Syria in April 1978 resulted in a number of 
agreements for increased economic, technical and scientific 
cooperation.  Ways and means for promoting closer bilateral 
relations were discussed during the visit of the Prime Minister 
of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen to India in 
May 1978.  Cooperation with Iraq in industrial ventures and 
other fields received an impetus following the visit of 
Vice-President of Iraq to India in July 1978.  The visit of 
Shri Mohan Dharia, Minister of Commerce, Civil Supplies and 
Cooperation to Iraq in September-October 1978 to participate in 
the Baghdad International Trade Fair, and the visit of 
Shri H. Bahuguna, Minister of Petroleum, Chemicals and 
Fertilizers as the Head of the Indian delegation to the 5th Session 
of the Indo-Iraqi Joint Commission held in Baghdad in December 
1978 also led to greater understanding. 
 
<br><br>The visit of Major Abdul Salam Ahmed Jalloud of the 
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahariya to India in July 1978 
 
 
<br><br>  pg18<br><br>
 
paved the way for greater cooperation in Libya's developmental 
programmes.  A number of agreements were signed during the 
visit for increased industrial and economic cooperation. 
Shri George Fernandes, Minister of Industry, visited Libya in 
December 1978 in connection with the first meeting of Indo- 
Libyan Joint Commission which had been set up to 
institutionalise the existing relationship between  the two 
countries.  Projects worth nearly Rs. 1200 crores to be executed 
by Indian companies, were secured during the visit. 
 
 <br><br>  The visit of the Foreign Secretary to Saudi Arabia in July 
1978 provided an opportunity for India to project its foreign 
policy and to review in depth the economic cooperation between 
India and Saudi Arabia. 
 
<br><br>The oil-producing countries in West Asia have embarked 
upon massive development plans which have opened up immense 
prospects for Indian exports to the region. 
 
  <br><br> From the total volume of exports worth Rs. 427.77 crores 
in 1974-75, the volume went up to Rs. 703.8 crores in 1976-77 
and from April 1977 to February 1978 it was to the order of 
Rs. 650.33  crores. A striking  feature of exports to these 
countries was their diversification from traditional items to 
sophisticated equipment and machinery, engineering products and 
electrical appliances.  India was also able to increase cooperation 
with the countries of the region in carrying out projects in 
various fields. i.e. construction of industrial projects, rails, roads, 
darns, civil construction and power generating plants.  In 1978 
alone, projects worth Rs. 1200 crores were secured by India. 
 
<br><br>There were a large number of Indian personnel working in 
the region ranging from highly qualified doctors, engineers and 
technicians to unskilled labour.  This reflected an awareness 
among the countries of the region of the benefits of employing 
Indians for carrying out various developmental projects. 
 
<br><br>India's relations with Iran continued to be marked by mutual 
trust and understanding. 
 
<br><br>The Minister for External Affairs paid his first formal visit 
to Iran in May 1978.  This was part of the continuing process 
of exchange of visits at different levels initiated by the 
Government last year.  During the visit, it was agreed that the 
process of building stability and confidence in the area, already 
under way especially through economic cooperation and 
<br><br>  pg19<br><br>
 
commercial relations, should continue.  The exchange of views 
continued during the Prime Minister's brief transit halt-over in 
Tehran in June 1978. 
 
<br><br>We carefully watched the political developments in Iran and 
at an appropriate time conveyed our sympathetic understanding 
of the Iranian peoples' aspirations for democratic rights to 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  On the successful culmination 
of the peoples' revolution in Iran, India recognised the new 
government led by Dr. Mehdi Bazargan. 
 
<br><br>The political unrest and slowdown in economic activity in 
Iran have had there repercussions on bilateral economic relations. 
This led to the exit and repatriation of a number of Indian skilled 
and unskilled workers from Iran.  With the restoration of 
political stability in Iran, we hope to establish mutually beneficial 
bilateral economic relations.

<br><br>AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA) 
 
<br><br>India continued to play an active role in  the international 
efforts to secure a just and peaceful solution to the problems of 
Zimbabwe and Namibia and in the campaign against apartheid 
and racial discrimination in Southern Africa.  At the Extra- 
ordinary Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of  the Coordinating 
Bureau of Non-Aligned Countries in Maputa  (Jan 26, 1979 
1st February 1979) which was convened to consider exclusively 
the situation in Southern Africa, India was unanimously elected 
Chairman of the Drafting Committee.  At that meeting Foreign 
Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, spelt out India's assessment 
of the situation in Southern Africa and our stand on the issues 
involved.  He noted that the minority racist regimes had for far 
too long resorted to blatant defiance of world opinion and 
remained impervious to moral forces; in consequence the freedom 
fighters had been driven as a last resort to armed struggle.  In 
regard to Namibia, he reiterated India's full support for all 
efforts by the U.N. Security Council towards implementing its 
Resolution No. 435(1978).  He also declared India's full 
support for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory 
economic sanctions against South Africa adding that if attempts 
of the Security Council to compel South Africa to end its illegal 
occupation of Namibia failed, the General Assembly should itself 
consider appropriate action in accordance with the United 
Nations Charter and its resolutions. 
 
<br><br>In regard to Zimbabwe, the Foreign Minister noted that while 
the Patriotic Front had consistently demonstrated its willingness 
to participate in negotiations for an internationally acceptable 
settlement, the illegal Ian Smith regime had repeatedly stalled, 
circumvented and sabotaged all efforts to bring about genuine 
majority rule.  He reiterated India's categorical rejection of any 
attempts to legitimise any provisions of the so-called Internal 
Settlement envisaged in the Salisbury Agreement of 3rd March, 
1978, In this context, he declared India's support both for 
review of the existing sanctions against Southern Rhodesia with 
a view to tightening and extending them under Article 41 of the 
 
 
<br><br>  pg21<br><br>
 
Charter, as well as the imposition of comprehensive economic 
sanctions against South Africa as a means of terminating the 
illegal Ian Smith regime.  With reference to the continuing 
practice of apartheid by the Pretoria regime, the Foreign Minister 
declared India's full support for the adoption of a comprehensive 
arms embargo against South Africa as also a complete embargo 
on oil exports to South Africa. 
 
  <br><br> India continued to provide all possible material assistance to 
the liberation movements in Southern Africa, namely, the 
Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe, SWAPO of Namibia and the ANC 
of South Africa.  India also appealed for united within the 
liberation movements.  Mr. Sam Nujoma, President of SWAPO 
visited India in April, 1978. 
 
 <br><br>  In response to the U.N. General Assembly Resolution 
proclaiming 21st March, 1978 to 21st March, 1979 as "United 
Nations International Anti-Apartheid Year", the Government of 
India appointed a National Committee under the Chairmanship 
of Shri Asoka Mehta, which has been implementing a nation-wide 
programme of activities such as seminars, publications, film shows 
etc. aimed at mobilising public opinion against apartheid. 
 
 <br><br>  India's traditionally friendly and close relations with Mauritius 
were further consolidated through exchange of high level visits 
and conclusion of bilateral agreements.  We had the privilege of 
receiving from the Mauritian side visits by the Prime Minister, 
Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, in January 1979; the Finance 
Minister Sir V. Ringadoo; the Minister of Commerce and Industry, 
Hon'ble D. Basant Rai; and Minister of Labour and Industrial 
Relations, Mr. A. R. Yousuf Mohammed.  Our Foreign Minister, 
Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, visited Mauritius from the 26th to 
27th January, 1979.  The Instruments of Ratification relating 
to the Economic, Technical and Cultural Cooperation Agreement 
between the two countries were exchanged.  The agreement 
inter alia provides for the setting up of a Joint Commission. 
 
<br><br> The Seychelles Foreign Minister, Mr. Guy Sinon, paid his 
first official visit to India from 30th October to 5th November, 
1978.  During his visit an Air Services Agreement and an 
Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation between 
India and Seychelles were concluded.

<br><br>The Prime Minister of India attended the funeral of the late 
President Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya in Nairobi in August, 1978. 
During the visit he also discussed matters of mutual interest with 
the successor President Mr. Daniel Arap Moi.  The Foreign 
Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, visited Nairobi from the 
4th to 5th February, 1979, during which he exchanged views on 
bilateral and international matters with Kenya's Foreign Minister 
Mr. M. Waiyaki.  The Assistant Minister of Commerce of Kenya, 
Mr. Okiki Amayo visited India from 27th September to 8th 
October, 1978. 
 
<br><br>The Tanzania Vice-President, Mr. Aboud Jumbe, visited 
India in April, 1978.  The Tanzania Minister of Finance and 
planning, Mr. Edwin Mtei, led his country's delegation to India 
for the Third Session of Indo-Tanzania Joint Commission in 
November 1,978, which identified further avenues of bilateral 
cooperation. 
 
<br><br>Ties with Zambia were further strengthened through the State 
Visit to India of Zambian Prime Minister, Mr. Daniel Lisulo in 
December 1978, and our Foreign Minister's visit to Zambia in 
February 1979, during which he had discussions with President 
Kenneth Kaunda on matters of mutual interest including the ways 
and means to further develop cooperation betwen the two 
Countries.  During Prime Minister Lisulo's visit a Trade 
Agreement was signed and India agreed in principle to grant a 
Government-to-Government credit of Rs. 100 million to Zambia. 
The agreement on the avoidance of double taxation was concluded 
between India and Zambia on 24th February, 1979. 
 
  <br><br> Shri Asoka Mehta, Chairman of the Indian National 
Committee for the Observance of the U.N. International anti- 
Apartheid Year paid a visit to Zambia from 23rd to 30th 
October, 1978 at the invitation of the Government of Zambia.

that there was considerable scope for further developing our 
economic and technical cooperation with the countries of the 
region and that for that purpose strengthening of our diplomatic 
representation in Africa was necessary.

EUROPE 
 
West Europe 
 
<br><br>India continued to build on its balanced and constructive 
relationship with the countries of West Europe in the political, 
economic, cultural and commercial fields.  A number of high-level 
visits were exchanged which provided an opportunity to streng- 
then bilateral friendship, review developments of mutual interest 
and chalk out programmes for cooperation. 
 
   Aware of the structural changes in the European Economic 
Community and its projected enlargement  (to include Spain 
Portugal and Greece), India paid attention to the development 
of closer relations with its members individually and collectively. 
 
   India followed the developments in the process of detente 
and, while welcoming it, lost no opportunity of conveying to 
European countries that detente should cover all pails of the 
world by promoting the settlement of problems by peaceful 
negotiations and helping progress towards disarmament. 
 
   India's ties with Britain were reinforced by the Prime 
Minister's visit to London in June 1978.  He was joined there 
by the Minister for External Affairs.  The British Prime Minister, 
Mr. Callaghan, had come to India in January, 1978 on our 
Prime Minister's invitation.  The talks in June 1978 covered 
international and bilateral questions of common concern including 
Southern Africa, disarmament and race relations.  Mr. Callaghan 
affirmed his Government's commitment to the establishment of 
harmonious race relations in Britain and opposition to racial 
discrimination against any immigrant community residing in that 
country.   Specific complaints made by Indian nationals about 
unfair treatment were taken up with the British authorities for 
prompt resolution.  At the invitation of the Hon'ble Speaker, a 
British Parliamentary delegation led by the Earl Listowell visited 
India in December 1978 and strengthened the contacts between 
the Parliaments of both countries.  At the beginning of March 
 
<br><br>  <pg25> 
 
1979, Sir Michael Palliser, Permanent Under Secretary in the 
British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, visited India for 
official talks with the Foreign Secretary. 
 
<br><br>The visit of the Economic Minister of the Federal Republic 
of Germany, Count Lambsoorff, in August 1978 at the invitation 
of the Finance Minister led to a fruitful exchange of views 
regarding the future economic cooperation between the two 
countries.  An agreement was signed whereby the Federal Republic 
was to provide DM 360 million as development assistance to. 
India for 1978-79.  The visit of an Indian Parliamentary Delega- 
tion to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Meeting in Bonn and the 
formation of an Indo-FRG Parliamentary Group in the FRG 
Parliament and a similar group in the Indian Parliament reflected 
the mutual interest of both countries to have closer cooperation 
between their parliamentary institutions. In  January 1979, 
Dr. Meyer-Landrut, a senior official of the FRO Foreign Ministry, 
visited India for bilateral consultations with the Ministry 
Extrenal Affairs. 
 
<br><br>An agreement on Science and Technology was concluded 
with France in July 1978 during the visit of the French Minister 
of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. O. Stirn.  At the meeting of 
the Indo-French Committee on Economic and Technical Co- 
operation held in New Delhi in December 1978, during the visit 
of the Foreign Trade Minister.  Mr. Deniau, the two countries 
agreed to try and double the volume of their bilateral trade 
within the next four years and to increase cooperation in joint 
ventures in third countries. 
 
   The Minister for External Affairs paid an official visit to 
Austria in May 1978 in response to an invitation from his 
counterpart.  The two countries agreed to maintain regular 
contacts at ministerial level.  While the Minister lauded the 
contribution of Austria's "permanent and active neutrality" in 
promoting detente, security and cooperation in Europe, the 
Austrian Foreign Minister expressed appreciation for India's 
policy of non-alignment.  The Minister also had talks with the 
Austrian President and Chancellor Kreisky.  The Minister of 
State for External Affairs visited Vienna later in the year, as did 
the Minister for Steel and the Industry Minister.  The talks held 
between the two sides strenthened cooperation between India 
and Austria.  This was given a further impetus by the visit to 
India of Mrs. Finberg, Minister for Science and Technology, in 
January 1979 on an invitation from the Education Minister. 
<br><br>  <pg26> 
 
Promising lines for cooperation between the two countries in 
science and technology were identified. 
 
<br><br>The Prime Minister's visit to Brussels in June 1978 resulted 
in a useful exchange with the Belgian Prime Minister on inter- 
national and bilateral matters.  The Belgian Minister for Foreign 
Trade came to India in April 1978 which also opened up 
possibilities for promotion of trade between the two countries. 
 
   The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. C. A. Van der 
Klaauw, visited India in October 1978, the first such visit in 
more than 15 years.  Discussion,, between him and the Minister 
for External Affairs stressed the possibilities for, further coopera- 
tion between the two countries.  The visit of Dr. De Koning, 
Dutch Minister for Cooperation and Development, followed in 
December 1978 on the Finance Minister's invitation. 
 
   India maintained close relations with Italy.  An agreement 
on cooperation between the two countries in science and techno- 
logy was signed in Rome in April 1978.  The Italian Foreign 
Minister, Arnaldo Forlani, visited India in November 1978. 
India expressed the hope that Italy, a founder member of the 
European Economic Community, would use its influence to 
counter tendencies towards protectionism. 
 
<br><br>Relations between India and Norway were strengthened by 
the visit of Minister for Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilisers to 
Oslo in May 1978 and the return visit by the Norwegian Minister 
for Petroleum, Mr. Gjerde, at the head of a large delegation, in 
January 1979.  During the year, the Minister for Communications 
also visited Norway. 
 
<br><br>During the visit of the Swedish Trade Minister to India in 
July 1978, it was agreed that India and Sweden should take 
steps to increase and diversify their trade.  A Swedish Parlia- 
mentary Delegation visited India in August 1978 and conducted 
studies in the field of health and medical and social care.  The 
third meeting of the Indo-Swedish Joint Commission on economic, 
industrial, technological and scientific cooperation was held in 
New Delhi in October 1978.  Detailed discussions took place 
on matters relating to trade, science and technology, industry 
and possible industrial cooperation between India and Sweden 
in third countries. 
 
   The visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mr. 
Gunduz A. Okcun, to India in July 1978 helped strengthen 
<br><br>  <pg27> 
 
relations with that country.  A five-year agreement on economic 
and technical cooperation was signed during the visit.  An Indo- 
Turkish Joint Committee on Economic, industrial and technical 
cooperation was to be set up to help towards the effective impel- 
mentation of the agreement which provided for exchange of 
technicians, experts and training facilities between the two 
countries.  A cultural exchange programme was also drawn up. 
 
<br><br>India's concern that the Cyprus problem should be satisfactorily 
resolved figured during the call on the Minister of External 
Affairs by Mr. A Michaelides, President of the House of 
Representatives of Cyprus who visited India in response to an 
invitation from the Hon'ble Speaker in January 1979. 
 
<br><br>During the year India established a resident Embassy in 
Athens and the first resident Ambassador of India to Greece 
took up his post in September 1978. 
 
<br><br>India's excellent relations with the Vatican were maintained. 
India took part in solemn functions to mark the funeral of Pope 
Paul VI, the inauguration of Pope John Paul I, his funeral and 
the inauguration of Pope John Paul II.  The Minister of State 
for External Affairs led the Indian delegation on the first occasion, 
while Shri A.L. Dias was the Indian representative at the second. 
The Minister for Industry had an audience with Pope John Paul II 
in December 1978 and handed over a massage from the Prime 
Minister. 
 
<br><br>India's relations with EEC marked an improvement with the 
visit of Prime Minister to Brussels and his discussions with 
Mr. Roy jenkins, president of the European Commission.  An 
India-EEC Joint Commission met in Brussels in October 1978 
and discussed possibilities of increasing trade.  A proposal for 
establishing an India Trade Centre in Brussels in being imple- 
mented by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with the 
Mission of India to the EEC, and Government of India are 
working on the renegotiation of the commercial cooperation 
agreement with the EEC. 
 
<br><br>  THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE 
 
<br><br>India's relations with the Soviet union and other countries 
of Eastern Europe continued to grow in strength through exchange 
of visits at high levels and through the mechanism of Joint 
Commissions established by India with these countries for 
economic, industrial, scientific and technical cooperation. 
 
<br><br> <pg28> 
 
<br><br>It had been agreed in 1977 that the level of the Indo-Soviet 
Joint Commission would be raised by the nomination of the 
Indian Minister of External Affairs and the Soviet Deputy Prime 
Minister to be the two Co-chairmen.  At the session of the 
Indo-Soviet Joint Commission held in New Delhi in March 1978 
it was decided to set up a Working Group to draw up a draft 
Long Term Programme of Economic, Trade, Scientific and 
Technical Cooperation between India and the USSR.  This 
Programme had now been drawn up, initialled in New Delhi on 
1st December 1978 and is to be signed at the highest level during 
the forthcoming visit of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers 
of the USSR, Mr. A.N. Kosygin. 
 
<br><br>During the visit of the Minister of Defence Shri Jagjivan Ram 
to the Soviet Union in May 1978, Indo-Soviet cooperation in 
the field of defence was reviewed,  An Indian exhibition was 
held in Moscow in August 1978 to acquaint the people of the 
USSR with India's progress in the field of industry and trade. 
This was widely appreciated by over two million visitors to the 
exhibition. 
 
<br><br>During his visit to the Soviet Union in September 1978 the 
Minister of External Affairs, Shri A.B. Vajpayee held meetings 
and discussions with Soviet leaders, President Brezhnev, Chairman 
Kosygin and Foreign Minister Gromyko.  In a wide-ranging 
discussion on bilateral relations as well as of international 
questions, he emphasised the very great importance which India 
attached to strengthening its relations with the USSR and added 
that India's normalisation of relations with any other country 
would not be allowed to affect adversely its friendly relations 
with other countries including the Soviet Union. 
 
<br><br>During his visit to the Soviet Union in October 1978 Shri 
Biju Patnaik, Minister of Steel &amp; Mines held talks for enlarging 
the scope of Indo-Soviet cooperation in the expansion of existing 
steel plants at Bhilai and Bokaro. 
 
<br><br>The long standing question between the two countries 
regarding the new rate of exchange between the Rupee and the 
Rouble was resolved through a Protocol signed in November 
1978.  A new rate of exchange has been agreed upon which 
will apply to all the existing and future credits and commercial 
transactions.  India regards the new exchange rate as a reasonable 
readjustment between the two currencies taking into account the 
adjustment between the Rupee and other currencies.  The 
 
<br><br>  <pg29> 
 
Protocol also contains an agreed built-in-mechanism for future 
adjustments in the exchange rate.  The Soviet Union has provided 
an interest free 45 year deferred payment facility to meet additional 
liabilities arising from the application of the new rate of exchange 
in respect of supplies made and services rendered upto the date 
of the protocol under the existing credits.  The  Protocol  is 
expected to smoothen the flow of trade and further strengthen 
the economic cooperation between the two countries. 
 
   India also developed closer relations with other, socialist 
countries of Eastern Europe with a concerted effort towards the 
achievement of greater cooperation in diverse fields. 
 
<br><br>The Minister of Defence, Shri Jagjivan Ram, paid a visit to 
the GDR in June 1978 to exploit the possibilities of mutually 
beneficial cooperation in the field of defence. 
 
   In October 1978 during the visit of GDR Deputy Foreign 
Trade Minister two agreements were signed covering export to 
GDR of leather shoe uppers (worth Rs. 39.4 million) and 570,000 
tonnes of iron ore.  It was also agreed that India and GDR 
would strive to identify new areas of trade at the next meeting 
of the Joint Commission. 
 
   The third session of the Indo-GDR Joint Commission for 
Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation met in Berlin 
in December 1978.  A Protocol concluded during the meeting of 
the Commission identified several projects for implementation, 
including those relating to machine tools, dairy machinery, 
chemical industries, lignite mining, textile machinery and manu- 
facture of specialised firms. 
 
   A new stage in the relationship between India and the GDR 
was marked by the visit of the Chairman of the Council of State 
of the GDR, H. E. Mr. Erich Honecker, accompanied by a high 
level delegation, to India in January 1979.  Particularly significant 
was the Long Term Agreement on Economic, Industrial, Scientific 
and Technical Cooperation signed during this visit, which adds 
a new dimension to the already existing close cooperation between 
the two countries.  During the same visit an Agreement on 
Merchant Shipping between India and the GDR was also signed. 
The Long Term Agreement envisages, among other things, an 
exchange of experts, development and promotion of industrial 
cooperation, including transfer of technology and cooperation in 
joint ventures in third countries. 
 
<br><br> <pg30> 
 
   The fourth meeting of the Indo-Romanian Joint Commission 
on Economic, Technical and Scientific Cooperation was held in 
New Delhi from Mar 13, 1978 18 March 1978.  The commission considered 
measures to bring about an increase in bilateral trade and also 
examined the possibility of setting up joint projects in third 
countries.  The new areas of cooperation identified during the 
meeting included the setting up of a plant for production of 
600--3000 metric tonnes of Clinkers, supply of power equipment 
by Romania, setting up of a pelletisation plant and a port-based 
pig iron plant in India on production-compensation basis. 
 
   On his way back from a State visit to some countries in the 
Far East, the President of Romania, Mr. N. Ceausescu,  broke 
his journey briefly at New Delhi in June 1978, to exchange views 
on international and bilateral issues with the Prime Minister of 
India.  The two leaders agreed that there was considerable scope 
for greater economic cooperation  particularly  in  industrial, 
petro-chemical and meteorological fields. 
 
   The Trade Protocol for 1979 concluded between India and 
Romania envisaged an increase of about 25 per cent in the 
two-way trade turnover. 
 
   At the last session of the Indo-Hungarian Joint Economic 
Commission held in May 1978 an Agreement on Economic and 
Scientific Cooperation between the two countries was signed for 
the period 1979-81.  This Agreement envisages exchange of 
scientific information, joint research in various projects and 
identifies various items of engineering goods for export from India 
to Hungary as well as identifies several new projects which could 
provide the basis for cooperation between the two, countries. 
 
   The fourth session of the Indo-Bulgarian Joint Commission 
met in Sofia in May-June 1978.  Bulgaria agreed to set up two 
agro-industrial complexes, one each in Karnataka and Bihar. 
Some new projects were also identified for cooperation and under 
a Protocol the two countries agreed to explore possibilities of 
setting up joint ventures in medium and heavy industries in third 
countries.  A new Trade and Payments Agreement was signed 
in December 1978 providing for a switch over to trade in freely 
convertible currency with Bulgaria from 1st January 1979. 
 
   A two year Cultural Programme signed by Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Milos Vojta during his visit to 
India in November 1978 provided for greater cultural cooperation 
through an exchange of experts in various fields between the two 
countries. 
 
<br><br> <pg31> 
 
<br><br>India's relations with Yugoslavia continued to develop 
through exchange of visits bilaterally as well as cooperation in 
international forums.  The Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia 
Mr. Minic visited India in May 1978.  During his discussions 
with the Indian leaders important international issues were 
discussed and a broad consensus emerged on the need for 
maintaining the unity and solidarity of the Non-Aligned Movement.

THE AMERICAS 
 
The United States 
 
<br><br>The visit of Prime Minister Morarji Desai to the United 
States in June 1978, following the visit to India of President 
Carter earlier during the year, helped towards promoting bilateral 
relations between India and the United States and a greater 
understanding of each country's points of view by the other on 
various international issues.  The Prime Minister's statement 
that "even though our paths may continue to be different, our 
ultimate relations will always be the same" set the tone of India's 
relations with the United States.  Besides holding talks, with 
President Carter, the Prime Minister met members of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee and several important members of 
the Congress. 
 
<br><br>One of the major issues which figured prominently in the 
talks that Prime Minister had with US leaders during his visit 
to Washington and invariably in the continued exchange of letters 
between him and President Carter was that of nuclear 
cooperation between India and USA, particularly in the context 
of the US Non-Proliferation Act, the provisions of which would 
seriously affect the continued supply of enriched uranium fuel 
for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station.  In his talks and 
correspondence with President Carter, Prime Minister reiterated 
repeatedly the sanctity of contractual obligations and the need 
to avoid any form of discrimination in the field of nuclear 
cooperation between countries. 
 
   The visit of Commerce Secretary Mrs. Kreps and that of 
Mr. Newsom, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, to 
India from the American side and the visit of Minister of State 
Shri Kundu and the three Service Chiefs and some Members 
of Parliament and the Finance Minister reflected contacts at 
high level and exchange of views in various fields between the 
two countries. 
 
<br><br> <pg33> 
 
<br><br>The Indo-US Sub-Commission on Science and Technology 
met in November 1978 in Delhi.  It recommended an allocation 
of $ 2 million for integral rural development and cooperation 
in developing non-science subjects relating to the rural sector 
including exchange of information between the two countries 
in this regard. 
 
<br><br>The Economic and Commercial Sub-Commission, which also 
met in November, discussed a wide range of multilateral and 
bilateral economic and trade issues.  India explained that its 
foreign investment policy was designed to encourage transfer 
of sophisticated technology and production of commercially 
needed goods.  It also raised the issue of difficulties being faced 
by Indian exports to the US market. 
 
   Another field in  which the two countries cooperated was that 
of space research.  A memorandum was signed in July 1978 
which provided for the launching of an Indian national satellite 
(INSAT-I) aboard  NASA's space shuttle planned for 1981. 
 
<br><br>Dr. Joseph Nye, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and 
principal negotiator on nuclear matters, also visited Delhi in 
November and discussed  with senior  Indian officials future 
nuclear cooperation between India and the United States.  The 
nuclear issue, however, remains one important factor of difference 
between the two countries. 
 
CANADA 
 
   The year was marked by greater cooperation between India 
and Canada in cultural and economic affairs.  Under an 
agreement signed in February 1978, India agreed to give a 
grant of Rs. 48 lakhs for promotion of academic and cultural 
exchanges between India and Canada.  The same month, an 
agreement wag signed whereby Canada would give a loan to 
India worth C$ 10 million (Rs. 7.43 crores) for import of ferti- 
lizers and fertilizer materials. 
 
   A number of high-level visits were exchanged between the 
two countries.  Shri Arif Beg, Minister for State for Commerce, 
visited Canada and Mr. T. Abbott, Canadian Minister for Small 
Business, led a trade team to India.  The visit of Mr. Abbott 
led to the decision to set up a Joint Commission between India 
and Canada.  The Canadian leader of the Opposition, Mr. Joe 
Clarke, along with Opposition spokesman on Finance, 
Mr. Sinclair Stevens, visited India in January 1979 and exchanged 
<br><br> <pg34> 
 
views on bilateral and international issues with Indian leaders. 
Earlier, the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Roche 
had also visited India in July.  On the cultural side, Mr. Roy 
McMurtry, the Attorney General of the province of Ontario, 
visited India at the invitation of the Indian Council for Cultural 
Relations. 
 
South and Central America 
 
   There was a greater emphasis on developing economic and 
commercial relations with the countries in the Caribbean and 
Latin America.  The awareness in this region that India was 
emerging as a leading industrial country which could offer 
technological and scientific cooperation led to a shift in emphasis 
from cultural agreements to signing of agreements in the field 
of trade, science and technology. 
 
   A delegation from Brazil led by Mr. Paulotaroso Flecha De 
Lima, Head of Department of Promotion of Trade of Brazilian 
Ministry of External Relations visited India in June 1978 and 
held discussions with various authorities regarding increasing 
trade between India and Brazil.  The Chairman of the State 
Trading Corporation led a delegation to Brazil in September 
1978 and hid wide-ranging discussions with various Chambers 
of Commerce and public sector companies.  A delegation from 
Cuba led by Amadeo Blanco, Director, Asia and Africa Division 
of the Cuban Ministry of Commerce during his visit to India in 
October 1978  held discussions to identify  items of exports 
between the two countries and the signing of a trade agreement. 
 
   The Minister of External Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Isidoro 
Malnierca Peoli paid an official visit to India during November 
1978.  He held discussions on bilateral relations and regarding 
the Non-Aligned movement.  India and Cuba being both 
members of the movement had maintained continuous dialogue 
on problems relating to the movement.  During the visit of the 
Minister an agreement was signed on cooperation in the field of 
Science and Technology and a Cultural Exchange programme. 
A  two-member  delegation  represented  India  on  the 
25th Anniversary of the Attack on Moncadaporracks.  Another 
delegation led by Dr. Ram Kripal Singh, Minister of State for 
Parliamentary Affairs visited Cuba to represent India on the 
20th Anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. 
<br><br> <pg35> 
 
   A Mexican delegation led by Dr. Edmundo Flores, Director- 
General of the National Council of Science and Technology 
visited India in November 1978 to review the Indo-Mexican 
programme on cooperation in the field of science and technology. 
 
   A delegation of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisation 
and another of the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry proposes to visit Latin American countries in the 
near future to explore trade possibilities with the countries of 
the region. 
 
  India welcomed the independence of Dominica on 
Nov 03, 1978 and its becoming a member of the 
Commonwealth.

UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCES 
 
<br><br>During the year, India continued to take active interest in 
the activities of the United Nations and its specialised agencies 
and in other international conferences.  India participated very 
actively in the Thirty-Third session of the United Nations 
General Assembly as well as at its various special sessions on 
specific problems.  Besides, it took part in the World Conference 
to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination held in Geneva 
from  Aug 14, 1978 to 25  August, 1978.  India continued its active 
participation in the meetings of the Non-aligned Movement of 
which there were several during the year, namely, the meeting 
of the Coordinating Bureau of Non-aligned Countries at Foreign 
Ministers' level in Havana  (15-20 May, 1978), the Conference 
of the Foreign Ministers of all non-aligned countries held in 
Belgrade (24-30 July,  1978) and the meeting of the 
Coordinating Bureau of Non-aligned Countries of Foreign 
Ministers' level in Maputo  (26 January-2 February, 1979). 
 
   The Minister of State of External Affairs, Shri Samarendra 
Kundu, led the Indian delegation to the Conference of Foreign 
Ministers of the 25-member Coordinating Bureau of Non-aligned 
Countries which met in Havana from 18 to 20 May, 1978. 
The Conference adopted a document divided into political and 
economic sections.  The political section addressed itself to the 
definition and role of non-alignment, need for unity and solidarity 
among non-aligned countries, and the re-affirmation of the views 
of non-aligned countries on major international issues.  It also 
endorsed the reports and recommendations of the three 
conferences of non-aligned agencies on information and broad- 
casting held at Djakarta, Sarajevo and Havana.  The economic 
section contained an analysis of the current international 
economic situation, an assessment of the outcome of the ongoing 
dialogue between the developed and developing countries, the 
elements that should go into the forumulation of the Strategy 
for the Third Development Decade, and review of the progress 
in the implementation of the Colombo Action programme for 
<br><br> <pg37> 
 
Economic Cooperation Among the Non-aligned and Developing 
Countries. 
 
<br><br>The Minister for External Affairs, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
led the Indian delegation to the Third Conference of Foreign 
Ministers of Non-aligned Countries held in Belgrade from 25 to 
29 July, 1978.  The Conference was attended by 86 member 
countries, 10 countries and organisations with observer status, 
and 9 countries with guest status.  Djibouti was admitted as a 
new member and Pakistan and San Marino as guests.  While 
welcoming Pakistan  as a guest, India expressed the hope that it 
would go on to detach itself from the military alliance system. 
 
   India was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Political 
Committee and presided over the drafting committee set up by 
the Political Committee to draft what turned out to be the most 
controversial part of the political declaration. 
 
   The Minister for External Affairs, in his address to the 
Conference,  reiterated  India's  total  commitment  to  the 
fundamental principles of non-alignment.  He pointed out that 
by faithful adherence to these principles, India was able to 
improve its bilateral relations with each of the great powers 
without being drawn into the differences between them or getting 
involved in issues  which  exacerbate  international tensions. 
Further, with the inspiration of the non-alignment philosophy, 
India had purposefully sought to resolve old and intricate 
problems and built bridges of understanding and cooperation 
with its neighbours.  He noted that a determined resolve to 
solve bilateral problems peacefully would release energies which 
could enable the movement to play its positive role in facing 
major world political and economic problems. 
 
<br><br>The Conference was held in the midst of a great deal of 
speculation regarding the ability of the movement to maintain 
its unity and cohesion in view of the emergence of sharp 
differences and bilateral conflicts between some of the non-aligned 
countries.  The Conference addressed a special appeal to the 
non-aligned countries involved in bilateral disputes to make 
every effort to reach a peaceful settlement through negotiations. 
In addition, it recommended that non-aligned countries could 
render assistance to the parties concerned towards a resolution 
of such disputes.  India's contention that if the countries 
remained genuinely non-aligned, any attempt either from inside 
or outside could not weaken or deflect the movement received 
wide support. 
 
6 EA/78--4 
<br><br> <pg38> 
 
<br><br>The Conference adopted a two-part Declaration and a 
separate section containing a review of the implementation of the 
Colombo Action Programme for Economic Cooperation.  As 
in the past, the political part of the Declaration reflected the 
joint stand of the non-aligned countries on major international 
issues as well as issues facing the non-alignment movement itself. 
A new feature of the Declaration was a section on Human 
Rights which, at the initiative of India, stressed the need for the 
world community to adopt an integral and comprehensive 
approach to human rights in all its aspects. 
 
   A Special Conference of Foreign Ministers of the 
Coordinating Bureau of Non-aligned countries was held in 
Maputo (Mozambique) from 28 January to 2 February, 1979 
to consider the developments in Southern Africa.  In a 
Declaration adopted after the conclusion of the Conference, the 
Bureau reiterated the decisions and recommendations made at 
earlier non-aligned meetings and at the United Nations and 
called for further measures including : 
 
(a)  Increased support in all forms--political, diplomatic, 
<br><br> military and financial--for the liberation struggle 
<br><br> in South Africa. 
 
(b)  Imposition of a complete and effective oil embargo 
<br><br> on South Africa. 
 
(c)  Prevention of recruitment, training, transit and 
<br><br> financing of foreign mercenaries. 
 
(d)  Admission of the Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe) as 
<br><br> a full member of the non-aligned movement. 
 
   The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Samarendra 
Kundu, led the Indian delegation to the World Conference to 
Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination held at Geneva from 
14 to 25 August, 1978.  Sri Samarendra Kundu, in his speech, 
highlighted the contribution made by India to the struggle against 
apartheid in South Africa.  Declaring that only firm and 
decisive measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations 
Charter could force South Africa to see the path of sanity, he 
stressed that mandatory measures against that country must 
include sanctions against export of oil, investment capital, arms 
and nuclear collaboration. 
 
<br><br>The 8th special session of the General Assembly, which met 
from 20 to 21 April, 1978. was called specially to consider the 
<br><br> <pg39> 
 
question of making financial provisions for the United Nations 
Force in Lebanon  and adopted a resolution apportioning 
US $ 54 million for the operation of this Force (UNIFL) for 
the period 19 March  to 18 November, 1978. India contributed 
US $ 73,132 towards this amount. 
 
<br><br>The Minister for External Affairs of India led the Indian 
delegation to the 9th Special Session of the UN General 
Assembly held from 24 April to 3 May, 1978 to consider the 
question of Namibia.  The Minister, in his address, underlined 
that the special session provided the United Nations with the last 
chance to take decisive steps towards bringing genuine 
independence to the people of Namobia.  He reiterated India's 
firm and abiding support for the struggle of the people of 
Namibia for liberation and promised all possible support to the 
freedom fighters of the country.  The special session adopted 
a Declaration and a Programme of Action which was initially 
drawn up by the Council for Namibia of which India was an 
active member and Vice-President.  The Programme called for 
complete, immediate and unconditional  withdrawal of South 
Africa from Namibia.  The Declaration reiterated that Namibia 
was a direct responsibility of the United Nations until genuine 
self-determination and national independence was achieved by 
it.  In keeping with this, the General Assembly reiterated its 
commitment to discharge the solemn obligation it had assumed 
to assist the Namibian people in achieving self-determination and 
independence. 
 
   The Tenth Special Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly, devoted to disarmament, was held from 23 May to 
30 June, 1978.  This represented a major achievement for the 
Non-Aligned movement which had suggested the convening of 
such a session as early as in 1961 at its first Summit Conference 
held in Belgrade and reiterated it at the Colombo Conference 
of Heads of Governments/States of Non-Aligned Countries held 
in 1976.  The Prime Minister, who led the Indian delegation 
to the Special Session, in his address, stressed the necessity to 
keep in view the final objective of realising total disarmament 
without any  reservation,  and the necessity  to work out a 
non-discriminatory programme based on universal application 
shorn of any monopolistic feature or preferential treatment. 
The first step in that direction, he said, should be a declaration 
outlawing utilisation of nuclear technology for military purposes, 
freezing of present stockpile of nuclear arms under international 
inspection, qualitative  and quantitative  limitation of nuclear 
<br><br> <pg40> 
 
armament and gradual reduction of the stockpile with a view 
to achieving total elimination of all nuclear weapons.  He also 
advocated the adoption of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
with provisions to prevent its breach through independent 
inspection.  The Final Document adopted by the Special Session, 
inter alia, called on the nuclear-weapon-States to initiate urgent 
negotiations on both qualitative and quantitative freeze as well 
as for a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time 
frames, for the reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons leading 
to their ultimate and complete elimination.  In the area of 
conventional weapons, the document called for the limitation 
and gradual reduction of armed forces and conventional weapons 
within the framework of progress towards general and complete 
disarmament. 
 
   The special session achieved significant results in the field 
of machinery for disarmament deliberations  and negotiations. 
A Disarmament Commission open to all members of the United 
Nations  was  established to make  recommendations  on 
disarmament problems, follow up the work of the Special Session, 
to consider the elements of a comprehensive disarmament 
programme and to report annually to the United Nations General 
Assembly.  Shri M. A. Vellodi, Secretary, Ministry of External 
Affairs was unanimously elected as the first Chairman of the 
United Nations Disarmament Commission.  The existing 
Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD) was 
replaced by a new negotiating body, Committee on Disarmament. 
This body consists of the nuclear-weapon-States and 35 other 
member-States of the United Nations.  The Committee now 
consists of all the 31 members of the CCD plus 8 other States, 
i.e., Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Cuba, Indonesia.  Kenya. 
Sri Lanka and Venezuela.  The first meeting of the Committee 
on Disarmament was held in Geneva on 24th January, 1979. 
By its attendance in this meeting, France participated in 
multilateral disarmament negotiations for the first time since the 
establishment of an 18-nation Disarmament Committee (EDC) 
1962.  China, however, has not yet agreed to participate in the 
work of the new Committee on Disarmament. 
 
   Shri D. T. Lakdawala, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning 
Commission, led the Indian delegation to the United Nations 
Conference on Technical Cooperation Among Developing 
Countries held in Buenos Aires from 30 August to 12 September, 
1978.  The objective of the Conference was the furtherance 
of the national and collective self-reliance in developing countries 
<br><br> <pg41> 
 
through mutual cooperation.  The Conference adopted a Plan 
of Action which enunciated the objectives of technical 
cooperation among. developing countries and contained specific 
recommendations for action at the global, inter-regional, regional 
and national levels. 
 
<br><br>The Minister for External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, led 
the Indian delegation to the 33rd regular session of the United 
Nations General Assembly which met from 19 September to 
21 December, 1978 and again from 15 to 29 January, 1979. 
The Assembly had before it an Agenda of 126 items covering 
political, economic, human rights, social, disarmament and 
related issues.  The membership of the United Nations increased 
during the session from 149 to 151 with the admission of 
Solomon Islands and Dominica as the two new members.  The 
Assembly adopted over 250 resolutions, a majority of which 
was adopted by consensus or without vote.  India played an 
active and constructive role in the deliberations of the General 
Assembly and its Committees and took initiative in tabling or 
actively co-sponsoring a number of resolutions.  The Minister 
for External Affairs, in his address, delivered in Hindi, outlined 
the policies and attitudes of Government of India towards major 
international issues.  He made a plea for a better world for all 
through harnessing of modern science and technology to bring 
about progress and prosperity.  He expressed the hope that in 
the critical years ahead.  The world community through the 
United Nations would demonstrate its determination, realism 
and sagacity to realise the dream of universal peace based on 
freedom and justice.  During the period of the session, the 
Foreign Minister also addressed two special meetings at Foreign 
Ministers' level i.e., of the Non-Aligned countries and of the 
"Group of 77" developing countries.  In the latter meeting he 
called upon the developing countries themselves to be prepared 
to make sacrifices for the disadvantaged and relatively less 
developed among them.  He suggested the pooling of resources 
to assist the less developed countries and not to expect 
reciprocity for special measures adopted for them. 
 
<br><br>The question of Namibia figured prominently in discussions 
at the United Nations.  The five western members of the 
Security Council, i.e., UK, USA, France, Federal Republic of 
Germany and Canada, after consultations with the Government 
of the Republic of South Africa, SWAPO and neighbouring 
African Governments,  submitted a proposal to the Security 
Council in April 1978 for Namibia's transition to independence 
<br><br> <pg42> 
 
after UN supervised and controlled elections.  The Security 
Council took note of this proposal and following a visit by the 
special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General 
to Namibia and discussions with the parties concerned, adopted 
a resolution establishing a U.N. Transitional Assistance Group 
and requesting the Secretary General to report back on the 
implementation of the proposal  by 23 October 1978. The 
South African Government, in defiance of world opinion, declared 
its intention to hold internal elections under its own supervision 
and control.  The Security Council adopted a resolution 
condemning this decision and called for its cancellation warning 
the Government of the Republic of South Africa that its policy 
not to cooperate with the Secretary General in implementation 
of Security Council resolution would lead to the initiation of 
appropriate action under the UN Charter for the imposition of 
sanctions against South Africa. 
 
   A full-fledged debate on Namibia was also held in the 
General Assembly at its thirty-third session in spite of the 
attempt by the Western Countries to get it postponed.  India 
played an active role in ensuring that the question of Namibia 
was taken up by the General Assembly.  The Assembly adopted 
three resolutions by a majority vote, all of which were 
co-sponsored by India.  The main resolution, introduced 
primarily at India's initiative, condemned South Africa for its 
unilateral decision to hold elections under its supervision and 
declared the result of such elections to be null and void.  It 
called for imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN 
Charter against South Africa for its non-compliance with the 
resolution of  the Security  Council. Further, it stated that 
should the Security Council be unable to take effective action, 
the General Assembly should "consider the situation further 
and take all necessary measures in conformity with its relevant 
resolutions and the Charter for the purpose of dealing with this 
threat to international peace and stability". 
 
   During the debate at the thirty-third session of the General 
Assembly on Zimbabwe, the administering power, Britain, 
referred to the "expanded proposals" handed over to the internal 
leaders, to the Patriotic Front and to the Governments of 
frontline States on October 20, 1978, and clarified that these 
proposals embodied the basic purpose of the Anglo-American 
proposals.  It suggested that the next step should be an all-party 
conference that would lead to full agreement on the modalities 
for independence and majority rule.  The General Assembly 
<br><br><pg43> 
 
adopted two resolutions on Zimbabwe by a majority vote.  India 
voted in favour of both.  The resolutions inter alia deplored 
the decision of the United Stated Government to allow the entry 
into the United States of Ian Smith and some members of his 
illegal regime. It further  called for widening  the scope of 
sanctions against the illegal regime of Southern  Rhodesia. 
These should include all measures envisaged under  Article 41 
of the Charter. It called upon the Security Council  to impose, 
among other things, a mandatory embargo on the supply of 
petroleum and petroleum products to South Africa  since these 
were transported into Southern Rhodesia from South Africa. 
 
<br><br>The question of the Middle East and Palestine was debated 
against the background of the Camp David talks between the 
United States, Egypt and Israel on a settlement in West Asia. 
the resolution on West Asia, co-sponsored by India, reaffirmed 
that a just and lasting settlement must be based on a 
comprehensive solution under the auspices of the United 
Nation  and  called  for  the  early  convening  of  the 
Geneva Peace Conference under the co-chairmanship of the 
Soviet Union and the United States with full participation of the 
PLO.  The resolution on the Palestine issue, also co-sponsored 
by India, inter alia reaffirmed that a just and lasting peace in 
West Asia could not be established without finding a just 
solution to the problem of Palestine based on the attainment of 
the inalienable rights of the Palestine people, including their 
right to return to the homeland and the recognition of the PLO as 
the homeland and the recognition of the PLO as their represen- 
tative who should be allowed participation in all conferences 
on West Asia under the auspices of the United Nations. 
 
   The General Assembly once again adopted a resolution on 
a nuclear weapon free zone in South Asia, India voted against 
the  Pakistani-sponsored  resolution.  India  opposed  the 
resolution because it did not regard South Asia as an appropriate 
region for the creation of such a zone. 
 
<br><br>Two resolutions introduced by India calling for the 
prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons by an international 
convention and a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing pending 
a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty were adopted by the General 
Assembly by overwhelming majorities. 
 
<br><br>The question of the Indian Ocean being made a zone of 
peace moved a step forward when the General Assembly endorsed 
<br><br> <pg44> 
 
the unanimous recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on 
the Indian Ocean and decided to convene a meeting of the 
littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean in New York 
from 2 to 13 July, 1979 as the next stage towards convening a 
Conference on the Indian Ocean. 
 
<br><br>The question of Cyprus was once again considered in the 
plenary session of the General Assembly.  Through a resolution 
co-sponsored by India, the Assembly reiterated full support for 
the  sovereignty,  independence,  territorial  integrity  and 
non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.  It called for an urgent 
resumption of meaningful and constructive negotiations under 
the auspices of the Secretary-General between the representatives 
of the two communities in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable 
agreement.  The resolution further recommended that the 
Security Council examine the question of the implementation 
within a specified time frame, of all its relevant resolutions and 
take appropriate practical measures. 
 
   The Second Committee of the General Assembly adopted as 
many as 65 resolutions, most of them by consensus, on various 
international economic and financial issues.  The decisions 
arrived at by consensus related to guidelines for the preparation 
of a new International Development Strategy, future work and 
mandate of the Committee of the whole and convening a UN 
Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy (excluding 
nuclear energy) in 1981.  A consensus resolution was also 
adopted calling for an adequate increase in real terms in the 
resources of the International Development Association and in 
the lending of the World Bank to developing countries.  Among 
the resolutions adopted by a majority vote were included those 
dealing with the preparations for the Fifth Session of UN 
Conference on Trade and Development, steps to combat world 
inflation, moves for a new International Wheat Agreement and 
convening a conference on restrictive business practices.  The 
Indian delegation played a major role in bringing about the 
adoption of the consensus resolution on preparations for an 
International Development Strategy for the 1980s.  Later, 
India was unanimously elected as Chairman of the General 
Assembly Preparatory Committee on New International 
Development Strategy.  India has also provided the Chairman 
for the Preparatory Committee on the United Nations Conference 
on the Application of Science and Technology for Development. 
 
   The UN General Assembly celebrated the 30th anniversary 
of Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  India piloted a 
<br><br> <pg45> 
 
draft resolution on the establishment and functioning of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
This was co-sponsored by all other countries and adopted without 
a vote.  Indias initiative in presenting another resolution, which 
was adopted without a vote, relating to the United Nations 
Decade for Women-sub-theme Employment, Health and 
Education--was also greatly appreciated. 
 
   The Indian delegation to the thirty fourth session of the 
Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva from 12 February 
to 16 March 1979 was led by Smt.  Vijayalakshmi Pandit.  The 
Commission dealt 29 items on its agenda covering different 
aspects of human rights and adopted a number of resolutions 
and decisions.  India played a very active role in the Session 
and was called upon to chair a number of working groups set 
up to deal with specific subjects.  The Government of India 
decided to accede to two important International Comments on 
Human Rights, namely, the International Comment on Civil 
and Political Rights and the International Comment on 
Economic, Social and Central Rights. 
 
<br><br>India ceased to be a member of the Security Council with 
effect from 31 December 1978.  During 1978, India effectively 
championed the cause of the victims of aggression, racism and 
colonialism.  India was particularly active whenever the question 
of Namibia came up for discussion in the Security Council.  India 
provided the Chairman for the Sanctions Committee against 
Southern Rhodesia. 
 
   The Minister of External Affairs introduced the Anti- 
Apartheid (United Nations Convention) Bill in the Lok Sabha 
in November 1978.  The Bill is likely to be taken up for con- 
sideration and approved by the Lok Sabha during 1979.  The 
object of the Bill is to give  effect to the  provisions of the 
International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment for 
the Crime of Apartheid which was adopted by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations on 30 November 1973 and to 
which India became a party on 22 October 1977.  The purpose 
of the said Convention is to make it possible for the  States 
party to the Convention to take more effective measures at the 
national and international level against the crime of apartheid. 
 
   The Law of the Sea Conference held its seventh session at 
Geneva from 22 March to 19 May 1978 and after an adjourn- 
ment it was resumed at New York from 20th August to 15th 
September 1978.  The Conference has so far achieved con- 
sensus on many issues, including a 12-mile territorial sea, a 
<br><br> <pg46> 
 
200-mile economic zone and the regime of the continental 
shelf.  However, a deadlock still prevailed because of the lack 
of agreement on the question of international regime for seabed 
minerals and particularly on the financial  between the Inter- 
national Seabed Authority and contractors and  transfer of 
technology to the Authority.  Towards the end of the Session, 
the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and other 
industrialised countries stated that they  were  contemplating 
unilateral mining legislation to accord legitimacy to the exploita- 
tion of the resources of international seabed  area for their 
nationals and companies.  The Gorup of 77 reiterated its view 
that such unilateral action would be illegal and its effects would 
not be recognised.  The Minister for External Affairs, speaking 
before the UN General Assembly in October 1978, cautioned 
the industrialised  States,  against adopting  unilateral mining, 
legislation. 
 
   The leader of the Indian delegation was unanimously elected 
Chairman of the drafting committee of the UN Plenipotentiary 
Conference on the Carriage of Goods by Sea which was held at 
Hamburg from 6 to 31 March 1978.  The Conference adopted 
a Convention on the subject which would replace The Hague 
Rules by what would be called the Hamburg Rules. 
 
<br><br>India participated in the work of the United Nations Corn- 
mission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) held at 
New York in June 1978.  The meeting finalised a draft con- 
vention on the formation and validity of contracts relating to 
international sale of goods.  The subject of the New Interna- 
tional Order was listed as one of priority items in the future 
programme of work of the UNCITRAL. 
 
   The Indian delegation, which participated in the deliberations 
of the Legal Sub-Committee of the UN Committee on Peaceful 
Uses of Outer Space, maintained its position that any treaty 
relating to the moon must contain an unequivocal provision 
that the moon and its natural resources were the common heri- 
tage of mankind.  The treaty, however. could not be finalised 
because of differences on this principle in the Sub-Committee. 
<br><br>On the question of remote sensing of the earth by satellites, 
the Sub-Committee was able to reach consensus on some more 
principles, but no consensus could be reached on the principle 
of prior approval in disseminating data and information;  the 
principle of navigation for conducting remote sensing activities 
and the relationship between the principle of full and permanent 
<br><br> <pg47> 
 
sovereignty of States over their wealth and natural resources and 
remote sensing activities. 
 
<br><br>On the subject of television direct broadcasting by satellites, 
the Sub-Committee failed to reach an agreement on whether it 
was necessary to obtain agreement of a State at whose territory 
direct broadcasting by satellites was specifically directed. 
 
<br><br>India participated at the fifth session of the Inter-Governmen- 
tal Group of Experts on Natural Resources Shared by Two or more 
States held at Nairobi from 23 January to 8 February 1978. 
The Group has formulated 15 principles for the guidance of 
States for the preservation and harmonious utilisation of natural 
resources shared by two or more States.  Later, the Governing 
Council of UNEP approved and forwarded these principles for 
consideration by the UN General Assembly.  The General 
Assembly took note of these principles and requested the 
Secretary General of the United Nations to transmit them for 
study and comments by Governments and report on it. 
 
<br><br>An officer of the Ministry attended the second session of 
the Working Group of Governmental Experts on Environmental 
Law held at Geneva from 3 to 12 April, 1978.  The Group 
considered the question of maritime pollution arising out of 
offshore drilling and mining within the limits of national 
jurisdiction. 
 
   India also took part in an Expert Group Meeting on 
Environment convened by the Asian-African Legal Consultative 
Committee at New Delhi from 18 to 21 December 1978.  The 
Group identified areas common to the region which needed 
urgent attention.  These included human settlement, land use, 
mountain ecology, industrialisation and marine pollution.

CHAPTER IX 
 
TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
 
<br><br> Believing in global  inter-dependence and collective 
self-reliance as the twin pillars on which the blue-print for the 
international development strategy for the eighties  should be 
based, India endeavoured to fashion its strategy for economic 
and technical co-operation in multilateral forms and work out 
new frameworks in addition to strengthening old and time-tested 
methods for developing economic and technical co-operation 
with developed, developing and socialist countries on the basis 
of beneficial bilateralism encompassing functional co-operation 
in different fields.  India continued to share its know-how and 
placed its skilled, scientific and technical manpower at the dis- 
posal of many developing countries and progress in regard to 
joint ventures scaled new heights. Inside  the Ministry,  the 
functioning of the Economic Division was streamlined by intro- 
ducing geographisation in the sense that bilateral economic and 
political work were combined in the territorial divisions with 
Economic Division concentrating on specialised tasks such as 
multilateral economic relations, long-term  programmes  and 
projects of co-operation, manpower and personnel work, admi- 
nistration of Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation Pro- 
gramme, analysis of developmental plans of developing coun- 
tries with a view to identifying areas of co-operation etc. 
 
<br><br>Progress in Joint collaboration and co-operation in different 
fields continued to be made within the framework of already 
established joint commissions.  During the year, a joint com- 
mission on economic, cultural,  scientific and  technical  co- 
operation with Mauritius was established and an agreement was 
reached in principle on a joint commission with Nigeria on 
economic, scientific and technical co-operation.  A budgetary 
allocation of Rs. 650 lakhs made under ITEC programme was 
sought to be utilised for providing training facilities in India 
for trainees from developing countries, deputing Indian experts 
to other developing countries, for carrying out technical economic 
surveys and feasibility studies and for gifting of equipment or 
projects, in different developing countries of Asia.  Africa and 
<br><br> <pg49> 
 
Latin America.  Consistent with our policy, stress was naturally 
placed on such programmes with neighbouring countries such 
as Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Mauritius etc. 
 
<br><br>Steps were taken to diversify and strengthen our economic 
relations with Nepal taking into account special problems  of 
Nepal as land-locked and least developed country, In regard 
to Afghanistan, we have agreed to finance feasibility studies as 
well as certain projects on mutually acceptable terms.  Though 
some problems did arise in our economic relations with Iran 
particularly in regard to availability of crude oil supplies from 
there due to political disturbances there,  by  and large the 
economic relations have withstood the  stresses and  strains 
and it is hoped that once political conditions get stablised there, 
our economic relations would gather new momentum. 
 
   India agreed to give tariff preferences to Sri Lanka for 
several products of interest in addition to permitting imports of 
certain banned products upto certain specified limits.  Other 
significant arrangements with Sri Lanka related to buy-back 
commitments for Indo-Sri Lanka joint ventures  based in 
Sri Lanka, preference to each other for imports of requirements 
provided quality and prices were suitable, co-operation in pro- 
duct developments in packaging of tea and special allowances 
to Indian visiting Sri Lanka for tourism.  The pilot plants 
projects being established in Burma maintained scheduled pro- 
gress during the year.  An economic delegation from Burma 
headed by the Minister of Co-operatives visited  India and 
acquired first-hand knowledge of the industrial progress made 
by India. 
 
   New ground was broken in regard to trade with China, 
Pakistan and Bangladesh.  India participated in the Canton 
Fair. 
 
   As regards co-operation with countries of South East Asia, 
a new dimension was added with the initiation of Indo-ASEAN 
dialogue.  The Secretary General of ASEAN had preliminary 
discussions in the Ministry.  Possible areas of co-operation with 
ASEAN were identified through inter-ministerial consultations 
and it is hoped that a detailed discussions will take place with 
ASEAN Secretariat in the near future 
 
<br><br>Indian co-operation with Vietnam was strengthened during 
the year, particularly in the field of daily sciences and oil explo- 
ration.  ITEC programme in regard to Tonga and Fiji was con- 
<br><br> <pg50> 
 
tinued.  Medicines and rice were gifted to Laos.  Indian entre- 
preneurs and public-sector organizations continued to be active 
in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines both in regard 
to joint ventures and for supply of capital equipment. 
 
   Indian expertise and technical know-how continued to be 
in great demand in the West Asian region, particularly because 
it proved apt and relevant to the conditions prevailing there.  An 
8-member Indian medical team was sent to the Peoples' Demo- 
cratic Republic of Yemen for three weeks under ITEC programme. 
A Protocol of Understanding was signed with the visiting delega- 
tion from the Ministry of Health of Sultanate of Oman for re- 
cruitment of medical and paramedical staff needed by that 
country.  Some beginnings were made in regard to durable and 
comprehensive economic co-operation with Saudi Arabia, Iraq 
and to some extent Saudi Arabia and UAE agreed to help India 
in meeting shortages in crude oil requirements of India as a 
result of troubles in Iran, Libya also showed understanding on 
this matter.  Economic relations with that country continued to 
make rapid strides, especially after the visit of Vice-President 
and Premier Jalloud.  A protocol was signed with Algeria on 
economic, scientific and technical relations.  Indo-Iraqi Joint 
Commission identified several fields for co-operation, particularly 
co-operation in the field of agriculture. 
 
   India's economic ties with Africa were further strengthened 
during the period, particularly with the island countries of the 
Indian Ocean, littoral and hinterland states bordering the Indian 
Ocean and Nigeria.  A decision was taken in the third session of 
the Indo-Tanzanian Joint Commission in regard to identification 
of possible participation by India in the Tanzanian development 
plan and for carrying out feasibility study for production co- 
operation for growing cashewnuts in Tanzania.  An Agreement 
on economic and technical co-operation with Seychelles was 
signed.  India gifted a further quantity of corrugated sheets for 
housing projects in Seychelles.  A Joint Commission with Mauri- 
tius was established and an agreement to supply 24,000 tons of 
rice to Mauritius was concluded.  About fifty Indian railway 
experts took their assignments in Mozambique.  The visit of the 
Zambian Prime Minister resulted in better mutual understanding 
about possibilities of co-operation between India and Zambia, 
particularly by way of India giving commercial credits for export 
of capital equipment and machinery to Zambia and Zambia 
agreeing to meet requirements of India for non-ferrous metals 
such as copper, cobalt tec.  The Malawi Minister for Industries

visited the Small Scale Industries Fair and returned deeply im- 
pressed with possibilities of Indian co-operation in Malawi's 
industrial development.  Trade with Kenya and Uganda register- 
ed further increases with exports of Indian commercial vehicles, 
sugar and textile machinery, gaining entry in that region. 
 
<br><br>In West Africa, close economic ties were developed with 
Nigeria and relations with Liberia and Sierra Leone were streng- 
thened.  RITES were awarded the prestigeous contract for 
railway management of Nigeria.  Nigeria continued to look to 
India for recruitment of experts for various fields such as tele- 
communications, medicines, architecture etc, An agreement with 
Liberia on economic and technical co-operation was entered 
into. Currently a Liberian request for management  of their 
mines etc. is being processed. 
 
<br><br>Exploratory work in regard to identification of concrete 
areas of economic and technical co-operation between India and 
Latin America continued.  It is proposed to organise a meet 
in New Delhi between Indian representatives and representa- 
tives from Economic Commission for Latin America to identify 
possibilities of technical co-operation between India and Latin 
American countries.  FICCI has proposed to send a delegation 
to certain Latin American countries in the near future to make 
an on-the-spot study of possible areas of co-operation. 
 
<br><br>With developed countries India continued to explore 
avenues of friendly co-operation in specialised fields involving 
import of sophisticated technology and joint ventures in third 
countries.  Efforts were also made in international and multi- 
lateral forums for persuading developed countries to take helpful 
decisions relating to official development assistance and mea- 
sures for debt relief.  India's point of view was also projected 
in high level meetings which Indian leaders had with leaders 
from developed countries.  The Prime Minister's meeting with 
the President of the Commission of the European Community 
was followed by the decision of the European Economic Com- 
munity to establish a Trade Centre in Brussels for providing 
specialised and technical services in the field of trade promotion 
for Indian speciality exports.  Consultations for renewal of the 
Commercial Co-operation Agreement between India and the 
European Economic Community have also made progress and 
it is hoped that a comprehensive economic and commercial co- 
operation agreement would be concluded in the near future. 
   <pg52> 
 
India's concern at the rising tide of protectionism in the develop- 
ed countries was communicated by the Prime Minister during 
his talks with the President of the Commission of European 
Communities in Brussels, by the Commerce Minister during his 
meeting with the American Secretary of State for Commerce, 
and the French Minister for Foreign Trade, and by the Finance 
Minister to the FRG Minister for Economic Co-operation. 
During the visit of the Dutch Foreign Minister, the Dutch 
Minister for Development Co-operation and the Italian Foreign 
Minister, our Foreign Minister put across India's views on the 
measures that need to be taken by  developed countries for 
bringing about the New International Economic Order.  India 
welcomed the retrospective terms adjustment measures under- 
taken by U. K. and Sweden in pursuance of Trade and Develop- 
ment Board Resolution for providing debt relief.  The Minis- 
terial level meeting of Indo-French Joint Committee has identi- 
fied areas for sectoral co-operation in fields such as coal mining 
and coal processing, telecommunications, electronics, offshore 
drilling,<br><br>automobile industry, etc. An agreement has been 
concluded with Turkey on economic, scientific and technical 
co-operation.  A dialogue with U.S.A. in the framework of the 
Indo-U.S. Sub-Commission on Economic and Commercial Co- 
operation and with Japan in the framework of Indo-Japan 
Business Committee have helped in a better perception of the 
possibilities and potential for bilateral co-operation and measures 
that are required in the light of contemporary economic realities 
for global management of inter-dependence. including, inter alia, 
increasing share of the developing countries in the decision mak- 
ing processes that affect the development of the developing 
countries. 
 
<br><br>With Socialist countries, India concluded several new 
agreements designed to further strengthen and promote economic 
co-operation in the light of the technical and industrial progress 
achieved by India in these countries and in the context of the 
evolving environment for international economic relations.  A 
long-term programme of economic, trade, scientific and technical 
co-operation between India and the USSR was finalised during 
the year and initialled.  This would involve co-operation 
setting up new enterprises in India, improvements in existing 
enterprises built with Soviet assistance, co-operation in third coun- 
tries, co-operation in science &amp; technology and co-operation in 
trade and planning.  During the visit of the First Secretary of the 
GDR, a long-term agreement on economic, scientific and techni- 
cal co-operation was finalised.  The Indo-Bulgarian Joint Com- 
<br><br> <pg53> 
 
mission has identified new areas of co-operation, particularly for 
agro-based industries.  The Indo-Hungarian and the Indo-GDR 
Joint Commission meetings have helped focussing on opportunities 
that are available for co-operation in third countries. 
 
<br><br>India actively participated in programmes of co-operation 
within Commonwealth  framework,  i.e.,  Colombo Plan, 
the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation, the 
Special Commonwealth African Assistance Programme.  India 
hosted a meeting of experts from South East Asian and Pacific 
countries (Commonwealth) on energy during which detailed dis- 
cussions took place on co-operation in this vital field.  India 
also actively participated in the meeting of the senior Common- 
wealth officials held in Kuala Lumpur preparatory to the meet- 
ing of the Commonwealth Heads of Governments/States.

CHAPTER X 
 
EXTERNAL PUBLICITY 
 
<br><br>The publicity and information activities of the Ministry are 
guided by the consideration to promote a better understanding 
and appreciation of the country's foreign policy and to locus 
attention on the progress made in social, economic, cultural, 
scientific and technological fields. This  was done through 
printed publicity material, through the medium of documentary 
and feature films as well as Indian newsreels and through the 
news bulletins issued by the various Missions abroad.  The 
spokesman of the Ministry, in his daily briefings, explained the 
policies of the Government to the Correspondents of Indian and 
foreign newspapers based in India.  Invitations were extended 
to foreign journalists and T. V. men to visit India to see the 
country's progress with their own eyes.  Appropriate  efforts 
were made to draw the attention of the journalists to the various 
initiatives taken by the Government hi building bridges of 
understanding with our neighbours in consolidating and diversi- 
fying established friendship and seeking to enlarge the areas of 
understanding and co-operation, in supporting the cause of 
liberation of countries in  Southern  Africa and by the re- 
assertion of India's adherence to the policy of non-alignment. 
 
<br><br>The Committee set up under Shri Chanchal Sarkar to 
devise measures to improve the work of external publicity sub- 
mitted its report during the year and efforts are being made to 
implement its recommendations. 
 
<br><br>The publicity work of the Ministry continued under the 
following heads 
 
(i) Press Relations 
 
<br><br>The press relations section acted as host to 37 foreign 
journalists and another 20 are expected to visit by the end of 
March 1979. 270 foreign journalists, who came to India on 
their own, were accorded all possible assistance to make their 
visits fruitful and were provided facilities to  acquire  better 
 
 
<br><br> <pg55> 
 
knowledge and appreciation of the country's policies and 
achievements.  About 100 more such journalists are expected 
to come by the end of March 1979.  During April 1978 to 
December 1978, about 87 foreign TV teams visited India for 
making documentary films on a variety of subjects.  Another 30 
are expected to visit by the end of March 1979. 
 
<br><br> Necessary facilities were given to about 80 Indian Journa- 
lists to visit foreign countries. 
 
(ii) Audio-visual Publicity 
 
<br><br>More than 400 prints of approved documentary films were 
supplied to different Indian Missions and Posts abroad.  Besides, 
four prints each of 7 feature films were sent to Missions on 
circulations on circulation basis.  A few more feature films of 
artistic value are being bought within this financial year. 
 
<br><br>Special compilation films on the state visits to India of 
several Heads of State were produced for publicity abroad.  A 
number of Indian Missions also organised Indian films weeks 
with films in their possession or supplied by headquarters. 
 
<br><br>To activise the film projection work of some of the Missions 
abroad, 16 mm. cine projectors were sanctioned for the Missions 
in Port Louis, Brussels, Mombasa, Male, Tananarive, George- 
town, Rabat and Rangoon. 70 gramophone records of Indian 
classical and film music and the national anthem were supplied 
to different Missions. 
(iii) ISI Transmission 
 
<br><br>Some 50 Missions were kept informed about the latest 
developments and progress in India with the twice-daily news 
transmissions through the Overseas Communications  Service. 
Efforts are being made to provide transmission receiving sets 
to other Missions also which do not at present have them.  Some 
of these Missions are being fed through  press cables on an 
average about three times a week.  Copies of daily transmissions 
are also sent to all Mission and Posts abroad by bag. 
 
<br><br>The External Publicity Division is actively considering a 
plan to link all Missions through the newly-introduced press 
bulletin service which will transmit daily bulletins to Missions 
through satellite.  When this goes into operation, the Missions 
are expected to be provided with fast, more detailed and more 
<br><br> <pg56> 
 
dependable means of receiving transmissions.  Arrangements for 
linking Indian Missions in North America through the satellite 
press bulletin service are about to be completed and depending 
upon the availability of resources and in the light of experience, 
it is intended to gradually extend the service to Indian Missions 
in other regions as well. 
 
(iv) Print Publicity 
 
<br><br>The External Publicity Division stepped up its activities of 
feeding Missions with increased supply of printed material on 
India's progress and achievements  Publications  "FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS RECORD" (monthly), "INDIAN AND FOREIGN 
REVIEW" (fortnightly) and "COURIER DE L'INDE" (a 
fortnightly in French) were, produced as before for distribution 
through Indian Missions to various media and institutions in 
foreign countries.  Efforts were made to make the INDIAN AND 
FOREIGN REVIEW more attractive by improving its cover 
and content by lending it colour and through addition of re- 
productions of Indian miniature paintings, poems, cartoons and 
articles of literary interest.  A few booklets published by the 
External Publicity Division for distribution by Missions includ- 
ed "CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN INDIA's FOREIGN 
POLICY" and "INDIA's ROLE IN THE CHANGING 
WORLD" by the Minister for External Affairs, Shri Atal 
Behari Vajpayee, "UNIVERSAL DISARMAMENT--A WAY 
TO GLOBAL PEACE" by Prime Minister Shri Morarji Desai, 
and "INDIA's ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST 
APARTHEID" by Smt.  Shanti Sadiq Ali. Other publications 
included pamphlets covering speeches by the Minister for 
External Affairs and the Minister of State in different interna- 
tional forums like the ECOSOC in Geneva, the non-aligned co- 
ordination meeting in Havana and the conference of Foreign 
Ministers of non-aligned countries in Belgrade. 
 
<br><br>On the occasion of the visit of the Prime Minister to the 
United States in June 1978, special feature articles were com- 
missioned in the series "Development India" written by specia- 
lists for wide distribution in the countries visited by the Prime 
Minister as well as in others.  Besides, World Press Review, con- 
taining selected comments on India by major newspapers in diffe- 
rent countries, continued to be issued and distributed widely. 
 
<br><br>The External Publicity Division also supplied books on 
various Indian subjects to the Missions for their libraries and 
<br><br> <pg57> 
 
for presentation, newspapers for their reading rooms and for 
local distribution, photographs showing development activities 
and cultural events in India, and assisted in the production of 
supplements by important foreign journals to bring out special 
features on different facets of the country's life and achieve- 
ments. 
 
   The XP Division also carried out exhibition and cultural 
work through supply of photographs, paintings for arranging 
exhibitions abroad, coordinated the work regarding sending of 
cultural troupes, holding of exhibitions of Indian modem art 
and of philately exhibitions in various countries and co-ordinat- 
ing the work regarding book exhibitions.  The Indian Art Exhi- 
bition, that opened in Paris in November 1978 and which ran 
till the end of February 1979, deserves special mention. 
 
   The work of restructuring the Indian pavillion at the 
Commonwealth Institute in London to make it themetically up- 
to-date was given to the Indian Institute of National Design, 
Ahmedabad, and it is expected to be completed by May 1979.

CULTURAL RELATIONS 
 
<br><br>The Indian Council for Cultural Relations continued to be 
the main agency for promoting India's cultural relations with 
other countries.  During the year, some administrative re-organi- 
sation was undertaken to increase its efficiency and rationalise 
the distribution of work.  Further, additional work was transferred 
to this Organisation from the Department of Culture in pursuance 
of the recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Com- 
mission, thus enlarging the scope of its activities.  These included 
handling of all incoming and outgoing cultural delegations, visits 
of academic delegations and Organisation of art exhibitions.  The 
ICCR, for carrying out these functions, would consult national 
academies and other professional organisations in the same 
manner as the Department of Culture had been doing in the past. 
There would also be periodical reviews of the implementation of 
the programmes assigned to the ICCR. 
 
   Until the middle of November, the Council sponsored 
17 Indian delegations and 48 Indian visitors to go abroad.  The 
individual visitors went to countries in Europe, North America, 
Latin &amp; South America and South East Asia.  A small number 
visited Australia and Japan.  The purpose of these visits by 
individuals was to participate in symposia and seminars, to study 
sciences or give lectures and present papers on social, political, 
artistic and literary subjects. 
 
<br><br>The delegations sponsored by the Indian Council for Cultural 
Relations visited Australia, West Europe, South East Asia, West 
Asia and North America, the Soviet Union and the neighbouring 
countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan.  The majority of 
these sponsored delegations specialised in the field of the evolving 
arts.  Their visits coincided with either international art festivals 
or other Indian fairs and festivals celebrated in these countries. 
 
   The Council received 36 visitors from Ghana, Syria, Indonesia, 
Pakistan, Chile, Surinam, Kuwait, Tunisia, Fiji, Costa Rica, 
Bangladesh, Vietnam, Botswana, Sri Lanka, Australia the United 
<br><br> <pg59> 
 
States, Kenya, Iraq, Brazil, Federal Republic of Germany, the 
Soviet Union and Turkey.  The Council gave more attention to 
incoming visitors from Latin and South America, South East 
Asia, Africa and West Asia. 
 
   The third annual meeting of the Indo-US Sub-Commission 
on Educated &amp; Culture was held in New York on May 15, 1978 16 May 
1978.  The meeting reviewed past activities under the aegies 
of the Sub-Commission.  Exchanges concerning academicians, 
personnel from the field of museology, performing arts, films, 
television and radio were also discussed as well as programmes 
for future joint seminars, exchange of exhibitions and joint 
workshops.  Under the aeigies of the Sub-Commission an 
exhibition on technology of American experiences was held in 
Bangalore, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Delhi, and Madras.  The joint 
seminar was organised in Now York in June 1978, in Srinagar 
in September 1978 and another in New York in November 1978. 
The Indo-US fellowship programme of the Sub-Commission was 
implemented and 16 fellows were received from the United States 
and 13 were sent to that country.  Under the programmes of 
exchange 14 middle level museum personnel from each side, two 
persons were received while the Indian Curator of the National 
Museum of Natural History went to the United States to work 
with Carnegie Museum of National History in Chicago.  The 
meeting of the two Chairmen of Sub-Commission held in Septem- 
ber 1978 expressed satisfaction at the work done so far. 
 
   The Council brought out 9 publications during the period. 
8 magazines and publications are in the Press and 5 manuscripts 
approved by the publication committee are under active prepara- 
tion for submission to the Press.  Its publications were sent to 
fairs and exhibitions in a number of countries. 
 
   A new cultural centre was set up in Suriname and its Director 
assumed charge of his office in early November.  Steps were also 
taken to improve the staff and equipment at cultural centres in 
Fiji and Guyana.  Action was also taken to provide equipment 
and depute the required scholars to countries like Fiji, Mauritius. 
Suriname, Medico, Rumania and Bulgaria from where the Council 
had received specific indications of their requirements. 
 
<br><br>Under the bilateral are exchange, programmes, the Council 
sponsored the visit of a number of troupes to give performances 
in India.  These included a 39-member folk dance ensemble from 
the GDR, a 40-member Tadjic opera ballet from the  Soviet 
Union and a 80-member Pyongyong school students and children 
<br><br> <pg60> 
 
are group from the Democratic Republic of Korea.  Other spon- 
sored programmes included concerts of three artists from Britain, 
two artists from Australia, a 20-member visiting group from 
Japan, a 5-member troupe from Cuba and a 24-member visiting 
troupe of national dance from Sri Lanka. 
 
<br><br>The Council continued to look after the foreign students and 
foreign visitors.  It received informal offers of land on partial 
finance for putting up hostels for foreign students in Maharashtra, 
Karnataka, U.P. and Tamil Nadu.  This was, however, on the 
condition that the Central Government, through the Council, 
would meet the major portion of the expenditure for putting up 
these hostels and for their staff and maintenance. 
 
   Under instructions from the President of the Council, steps 
were taken to reorganise the offices of the Foreign Students 
Advisers in various Universities all over India.  It is proposed 
that these advisers should be changed once every three years to 
ensure that the foreign students community gets fresh and dynamic 
attention to its needs in different educational institutions. 
 
<br><br>The editorial boards of the manuscripts being published by 
the ICCR were reconstituted consisting of eminent scholars.  The 
Hindi magazine was placed under Shri Bhowani Prasad Mishra, 
and Shri Ashok Mehta headed the editorial board for AFRICA 
QUARTERLY.  The Chairman of the publications committee, 
Dr. Karan Singh agreed to take an active part in bringing out 
other publications and magazines and it was hoped that this would 
bring about a qualitative change in the publication programme 
of the organisation. 
 
<br><br>The Ministry entrusted the Council with the task of coordi- 
nating activities relating to the commemoration of the United 
Nations International Anti-appartheid Year in India.  The Council 
evolved discussions on the programme at seminars, meetings and 
exhibitions to focuss attention on the problem and also to under- 
take a number of monographs and pamphlets on the subject in 
English, Hindi and other major Indian languages.  The Ministry 
provided a separate grant of Rs. 9.8 lakhs to the Council for 
this purpose.  The Council is also undertaking similar work on 
behalf of the Arab League and the United Nations. 
 
   The Council is also the secretariat of the Jury of Jawaharlal 
Nehru Award for International Understanding.  The Award for 
1976 to Dr. Giuseppe Tucci of Italy was presented to him in 
Rome in October 1978; the Award for 1977 to Shri Tulsi 
<br><br> <pg61> 
 
Mehrji Shristha in Kathmandu in September 1978 and the Award 
for 1978 to Most Venerable Nichidatsu Fujii of Japan in New 
Delhi in January 1979. 
 
   The scheme for providing educational facilities in the field 
of medicine and engineering to self-financing students from 
developing countries was continued during the year.  From the 
1159 applications for admission to medical courses received from 
nearly 35 countries, 68 students were selected and nominated to 
various medical colleges in India.  Similarly, 200 students from 
679 applicants were selected and nominated to various engineering 
colleges including the IITs.  Requests for admission to different 
polytechnic institutions for diploma courses were also received 
during the year and 20 foreign students were nominated to such 
courses.  These, of course, did not include nomination of students 
from Nepal and Bhutan whose cases were considered separately. 
A statement showing countrywise allocation of medical and 
engineering seats under the scheme for self-financing foreign 
students is at Appendix. 
 
   In addition to nominating self-financing students to engineering 
and medical courses, the Council also coordinated the grant of 
scholarships under the Schemes of General Cultural Scholarships 
Commonwealth Scholarship and Reciprocal Scholarship of the 
Department of Education.

PASSPORT, EMIGRATION &amp; CONSULAR SERVICES 
 
   There was all-round growth of the Central Passport and 
Emigration Organisation during the year.  The staff in the existing 
Passport Offices was strengthened and new Passports Offices were 
opened.  The number of passports issued also increased considerably 
as compared to the previous year.  The passport fee was revised 
from Rs. 25.00 to Rs. 50.00 and proportionately there was 
increase in the prescribed fees for various services rendered for 
the passports. There was also simplification and standardisation 
of the procedure regarding the issue of passports. 
 
   With the establishment of new Passport Offices at Bangalore, 
Kozhikode, Jaipur and Bhopal, the total number of such offices 
in the country rose to 13.  It was proposed to establish before 
the middle of 1979 six more Passport Offices at Bhubaneshwar, 
Gauhati, Jullunder, Patna, Simla and Srinagar. 
 
<br><br>There was considerable increase in the number of passports 
issued during the year ; 12.13 lakhs passports being issued as 
compared to 9.07 lakhs issued during 1977.  The number of 
applications received and the number of passports issued in each 
of the Passports Offices during the year 1978 are given  at 
Appendix VII.  This statement also gives details of diplomatic 
and official passports issued or serviced by the Ministry during 
the year. 
 
<br><br>A concerted drive was undertaken to clear the arrears of 
passport applications.  As a result of this, the arrears were reduced 
from 4.36 lakhs at the beginning of the year to 81.568 by 
Dec 31, 1978. Of this a total of 64,626 applicants who 
had not supplied essential data for inclusion in the passport or 
had not remitted the revised passport fee were informed that if 
they did not comply with the requirement by a particular date 
their cases would be treated as closed. 
 
<br><br>Steps were taken to improve and streamline the working of 
the Central Passport and Emigration  Organisation  through 
<br><br> <pg64> 
 
standardisation of procedure and strengthening of the staff of 
such organisations.  During the year 1978, 32 additional posts 
of officers and 334 additional posts of supporting staff were created. 
The total strength in different grades in  Central Passport and 
Emigration organisations at the end of 1978 is given at 
Appendix VIII. 
 
<br><br>The policy of granting leberalised endorsement at passports 
announced by the Minister of External Affairs last year, was 
given full implementation.  The authority for signing verification 
certificates in support of passport applications was extended to 
MLAs of State/Union Territories and MLC and Members of 
Metropolitan Council of Delhi and a total of 5.44 lakhs applica- 
tions had been so verified representing 52 per cent of the total 
applications received during the year.  Several measures for 
streamlining the procedure and cutting down delays were intro- 
duced following the conference of Regional Passport Offices held 
in Delhi in January 1978.  These included centralised receipt of 
passport applications and production of a new bilingual enquiry 
slips that would inform the applicants of the latest Position 
regarding progress of action on their applications, a standardised 
acknowledgement-cum-difficiency slip; a standard letter to 
policy/authorities concerned narrowing down and unambiguously 
defining the list of enquiries; the scheme of distribution of passport 
forms through Post Offices was extended to cover Head Post 
Offices in Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and North- 
Western circle.  The sworn affidavit system under which an 
application would be exempted from prior police verification 
before grant of passport was popularised in all the regions.  As 
a result of these measures it was possible to prescribed a time- 
limit of five weeks for issue of passport in respect of applications 
supported by verification certificates or, the sworn  affidavits. 
Proposals are also under consideration to introduce a simple and 
rational passport application form as well as a passport fee stamp. 
 
<br><br>In 1978, the total revenue earned by Passport Offices was 
Rs. 483.56 lakhs as compared to a revenue of Rs. 346.79 lakhs 
in 1977. The expenditure in 1978 was Rs. 145.03 lakhs com- 
pared to Rs. 104.20 lakhs in 1977. 
   There was considerable increase of emigration of Indian 
workers for employment abroad during the year.  The bulk of 
the emigrants wanted to go to West Asia, particularly to the 
countries of the Gulf.  The government took various measures to 
ensure better terms and conditions of employment for Indian 
<br><br> <pg65> 
 
workers abroad and to protect workers from exploitation both 
in India and abroad at the hands of unauthorised agents and/or 
their touts. 
 
   In February 1978, an inter-ministerial committee was appointed 
by the Labour Minister to go into the question of overseas 
employment of Indian workers in all its aspects and to suggest 
measures for streamlining recruitment and procedure for emigra- 
tion.  The Committee in its report submitted in September 1978 
recommended inter alia that a new Act should be adopted to 
replace the Emigration Act of 1922. 
 
   Pending acceptance of the recommendations of the Inter- 
Ministerial Committee, the Government adopted certain measures 
to rationalise the procedure that would help emigrants.  Individual 
emigrants who obtained jobs through their own efforts were 
allowed to emigrate on the completion of similar registration 
formalities without payment of required security deposit.  Two 
more embarkation points with airports at Trivandrum and 
Amritsar were declared lawful for emigration in order to help 
emigrants from States of Kerala and Punjab.  Besides the 
emigrants could obtain emigration clearance from any of the 
protectors of emigrants of India and could depart from any of 
the notified embarkation points declared lawful by the Govern- 
ment.  The staff of the officers of protectors of emigrants were 
strengthened to enable them to grant emigration clearance to 
intending emigrants within 72 hours.  A 24-hours emigration 
check was introduced at important emigrants left only  after 
obtaining the emigration clearance from the authorities concerned. 
This helped in ensuring better terms and conditions of employ- 
ment for Indian job seekers.  As a result foreign employers are 
now approaching the government for necessary permission to 
recruit workers from India which was earlier being done directly 
through the open market in violation of the prescribed procedure 
and provisions of the Emigration Act 1922. 
 
<br><br> With nearly 3 million Indians living abroad and their number 
still increasing, there was a great increase in the Consular work 
of various Missions, particularly those in West Asia and North 
Africa.  During the year Indian Missions/Posts extended such 
assistance to 41 Indian nationals who were stranded there.  In 
addition 1378 destitute Indians were repatriated from abroad, 
the number being more than double that of the previous year. 
Cases of 354 Indians who died abroad and settlement of death 
compensation and other claims against employers were also looked 
into. 
<br><br> <pg66> 
 
<br><br>The Consular Wing also assisted foreign Missions in India 
in tracing the whereabouts of their missing nationals and disposal 
of their bodies and their states. 
 
<br><br>An all time record of 89,524 judicial, commercial and 
educational documents were authenticated to facilitate their 
production abroad.

CHAPTER XIV 
 
ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
 
<br><br>Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Shri Samarendra Kundu were 
the Minister for External Affairs and Minister of State for 
External Affairs respectively during the year.  Shri J. S. Mehta 
was the Foreign Secretary.  The Administration was headed by 
Shri  Thomas Abraham till June 1978 and thereafter by Shri 
N. P. Jain as Additional Secretary. 
 
   The total strength at the Headquarters was 542 officers and 
2010 non-gazetted staff.  The strength of the various Cadres 
of the Ministry is at Appendix XIV.  The implementation of the 
Cadres review of IFS was completed during the year.  Cadres 
review of IFS(B) is in progress and is expected to be finalised in 
1979.  This would lead to a more rational staffing of IFS'B' 
personnel in Missions abroad. 
 
<br><br>The number of resident Missions/Posts during the year was 
127, including the Consulate General at Karachi which it was 
decided to set up during the year.  In addition, India had con- 
current accreditation in 47 countries.  The strength of the staff 
in Missions/Posts abroad was 650 Diplomatic Officers  and 
2584 non-diplomatic staff including local employees.  Several 
steps were taken to streamline representation abroad so as to 
strike the right balance between India's international objectives 
and its limited financial resources. The strength of the Mission 
in London was brought down by reducing the staff in the Supply 
Wing from 123 to 114.  A study has also been commenced to 
streamline the procedure of the Supply Wing in Washington as 
also computerisation of its work in the interest of economy and 
efficiency.  India's Consular Representation in the Gulf region 
was strengthened to meet India's increased responsibility in that 
region. 
 
   Further progress was made towards development of language 
expertise in the Ministry. Recruitment  Rules of the Interpreter 
Cadre were notified in June 1978 and action initiated regarding 
the formation of the Cadre. It is expected that with the com- 
mencement of recruitment of Interpreters in 1979, the Ministry 
<br><br> <pg68> 
 
will soon have the services of highly qualified  linguists. Extensive 
language training continued to be provided for IFS officers and 
the Ministry has now language expertise available in as many 
as 23 languages.  A comprehensive list of number of officers 
which have qualified in various languages is given at Appendix 
XV. 
 
<br><br>The inflationary trend in all countries resulted in an inevitable 
increase in the cost of financing the activities of Indian Missions 
abroad. The total expenditure of the Ministry during the 
financial year 1978-79 was estimated to be of an order  of 
Rs. 138.28 crores.  Out of this Rs. 33.55 crores is for financing 
Missions/Posts abroad;  Rs. 6.26 crores  for expenditure at 
United Nations and other International Organisations.  The 
balance is mainly to meet the cost of cooperation projects and 
programmes with respect to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. 
Details of expenditure are given at Appendices XII and XIII. 
 
   Since the increase in the cost of Missions abroad is largely 
due to heavy expenditure on rental of offices and residential 
buildings, great stress was placed on purchase and construction 
of India's own property.  Embassy residences were purchased in 
six countries (Sweden, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Norway and 
Ireland) and more are under active consideration.  Office-buildings 
were purchased in Syria and Belgium.  Further progress was 
made in the construction of office-buildings and residential 
apartments in countries where the Government of India already 
own land.  These included Thailand, Zambia, Canada, Indonesia, 
Nigeria and Turkey.  Preliminary planning is also in hand for 
construction in Nepal, Pakistan, Malawi, Australia and Kuwait! 
The total expenditure during 1978-79 on acquisition and cons- 
truction of property abroad is estimated at Rs. 6.00 crores for 
the next financial year.  A sum of Rs. 10 crores has been ear- 
marked for this purpose.  The Government of India now owns 
residences in 52 countries; office-buildings in 21 countries and 
office-cum-residences in 4 countries. 
 
   A separate Section of the Ministry is responsible for watching 
and monitoring the implementation of the Reservation orders 
in respect of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Details 
regarding the number of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in 
the total strength of the Ministry, vacancies reserved for Scheduled 
Castes/Scheduled Tribes and appointments made in these 
vacancies are given in Appendices X and XI.

<tr><td>CHAPTER XV 
 
USE OF HINDI IN OFFICIAL WORK 
 
   In accordance with the Government's policy, there was 
progressive increase in the use of Hindi in the work of the 
Ministry.  Efforts were made to use Hindi in as many spheres 
of activity as possible and the Official Language Implementation 
Committee in the Ministry kept a watch over the implementation 
of the orders and instructions issued in this regard.  The bigger 
Indian Missions were also asked to constitute Official Language 
Implementation Committees to see that orders and instructions 
relating to the subject were carried out in right earnest.  As 
during the last year, the Minister for External Affairs delivered 
his speech in Hindi at the 33rd Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly in October 1978, thus giving Hindi its rightful 
place in the comity of nations. 
 
<br><br> There was regular use of Hindi in protocol matters and work 
relating to international relations.  Documents Eke "Letters of 
Credence", "Letters of Recall" and "Commissions of Appoint- 
ment" as well as other protocol documents were prepared in 
Hindi.  Heads of Missions were advised that, while presenting 
credentials, they may, as far as possible, make their introductory 
speeches in Hindi. 
 
   Apart from the above, international treaties and agreements 
were also prepared in Hindi for signature.  The Ministry also 
rendered assistance to other Ministries and Departments of 
Government in preparing Hindi texts of such legal and formal 
documents. 
 
   The tradition established during 1977 was continued in that 
on important occasions like visits of Heads of States and Heads 
of Governments from foreign, countries where the visiting digni- 
tary spoke in his own language, speeches on the Indian side were 
made in Hindi.  A number of joint declarations were also 
issued in Hindi. 
 
<br><br>The Ministry issued a large number of notifications and office 
orders in Hindi.  Letters received in Hindi from the State 
 
6 EA/78--6 
<br><br> <pg70> 
 
Governments and from members of public were invariably replied 
to in that language.  The Ministry also sent letters in Hindi to 
Indian Missions abroad and to the Regional Passport Offices to 
the extent possible and some of the Ambassadors also correspond 
in Hindi with the Ministry. 
 
<br><br>Efforts were made to equip more Indian Missions abroad 
with Hindi typewriters and Hindi-knowing typists/stenographers. 
Twenty-two Missions were supplied with Hindi typewriters during 
the year and efforts are being made that all Indian Missions are 
supplied with such typewriters by the end of the next financial 
year.  Instructions were issued to Regional Passport Offices 
located in Hindi-knowing areas to ensure that Hindi should be 
invariably used in addition to English in all correspondence work. 
The Ministry took some positive steps to create a favourable 
atmosphere in the propagation of Hindi abroad.  They included 
posting of Hindi officers in the Missions in Mauritius and Trinidad 
and in the High Commission in Fiji.  Efforts are being made to 
create more posts of Hindi Officers abroad.  Hindi translators 
have already been posted to Indian Missions in London and 
Kathmandu. 
 
   Under the scheme for the propagation of Hindi abroad, Hindi 
books and equipment worth nearly Rs. 3 lakhs were sent abroad 
during the year to libraries in Indian Missions and to voluntary 
organisations to enable them to meet the requirements of local 
people, particularly of the people of Indian origin.  The Ministry 
also sent some Hindi newspapers and journals regularly to our 
Missions abroad.  A Hindi newspapers exchange programme was 
continued under which Hindi newspapers published in foreign 
countries are sent to Hindi newspapers of India and vice versa. 
 
<br><br>The Ministry, with the help of its Missions abroad, rendered 
necessary assistance to those foreign nationals and non-Hindi 
speaking employees who learnt Hindi through correspondence 
courses.  Efforts were made to renew and widen contacts with 
eminent foreign Hindi writers and to popularise Hindi in foreign 
countries. 
 
<br><br>The "Children's Hindi Classes" scheme, started in 1977 was 
continued and full use of it was made by the children of the 
employees posted abroad of the Government of India and public 
sector undertakings. 
<br><br> <pg71> 
 
   The Award Committee constituted under the chairmanship 
of the Minister of External Affairs met on Dec 20, 1978 
and decided to award "Vishwa Hindi Puraskar" to five foreign 
Hindi writers :-- 
 
(1) Prof. Odolen Smekal--Czechoslovakia. 
 
(2) Dr. R. S. McGregor--Britain. 
 
(3) Prof. K. Doi--Japan. 
 
(4) Pt. Kamla Prasad Mishra--Fiji. 
 
(5) Mr. Somdath Buchkory--Mauritius. 
 
The awards, which carried no money, were presented in the 
form of an art piece and a citation by the Prime Minister on 
24 January, 1979. 
 
<br><br>The Indian Council of Cultural Relations financed chairs of 
Indian studies abroad for which Professors/lecturers were deputed 
for teaching Hindi and other Indian languages.  These included 
visiting professors of Hindi language in the University of Bucharest 
in Romania, a visiting lecturer of Hindi at Sofia in Bulgaria and 
two in the Tashkent University in the Soviet Union.  For the 
propagation of Hindi abroad, lecturers were deputed to Trinidad, 
Surinam and Guyana.  The Professor of Dravidian Languages 
in Daker (Senegal) also conducted classes in Hindi. 
 
<br><br>The Indian Council of Cultural Relations continued to publish 
its quarterly Hindi publication "Gaganachal" to cater to the needs 
of the vast Indian community living abroad.  The Council also 
sent regularly Hindi books for presentation to the cultural 
institutions and arranged to project Hindi films in foreign 
countries.  In the cultural centres maintained by the Council in 
foreign countries, arrangements were made for teaching Hindi 
besides arranging instruction in Indian music, classical dance etc.
