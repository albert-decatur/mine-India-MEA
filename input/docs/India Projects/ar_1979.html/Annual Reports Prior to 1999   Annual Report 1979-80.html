<tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>The year 1979-80 witnessed major developments within India, 
in its neighbourhood and in the world at large<br><br> 
 
     Internally, the Government elected in 1977 resigned in August 
1979, and was followed by a coalition Government which held 
office till the January 1980 mid-term elections.  In these elections, 
the people of India gave an overwhelming mandate to the present 
Government, under the leadership of Shrimati Indira Gandhi, 
which assumed office on Jan 14, 1980.  On the same day, 
Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao assumed charge as Minister of External 
Affairs. 
 
  <br><br>   The transfer of authority was smooth and peaceful.  All politi- 
cal parties gracefully accepted the people's verdict and vindicated 
the unique commitment of the Indian people to democratic values 
and the system.  With its large population, geographically strategic 
situation and a stable political system, through which its people 
freely determined their own destiny without outside interference 
and its continuing commitment to the principles of non-align- 
ment and peaceful co-existence, India has emerged capable of 
contributing more meaningfully to regional and global peace. 
 
 <br><br>    The international situation today is characterised by a steady 
growth of increased projection of the military strength of powerful 
States, beyond their borders, in the pursuit of their interests, as 
perceived by them.  Through the year 1979-80, there were 
attempts at acquisition of military/naval bases and facilities and a 
strengthening of these where they were already in existence, crea- 
tion of rapid-deployment-forces for use in explosive situations, 
distant from those who raise them, and increased Great Power 
naval presence (particularly of the US) in the Indian Ocean 
area.   In an atmosphere of threats of military intervention 
or actual outside interference, further escalations and intensification 
 <br><br>
                                 i 
    <br><br>                             ii 
 
<br><br>of old and new rivalries have inevitably tended to create compli- 
cations.  Certain basic political realities, as also the interests of 
those outside the sphere of the interaction of powerful States, were 
ignored.  The world must recognise the futility of a build-up of 
arms, or induction of arms, into areas, regions and countries where 
indigenous and dynamic, social, religious and economic forces 
aspire for political change.  Experience has shown that client 
States cannot hide permanently behind the shield of armed secu- 
rity provided by others.  Ultimately reliance by nation-States on 
external security umbrellas, has grave repercussion on inter- 
nal political, social and economic stability, jeopardising, even 
affecting, their very independence.  In this process, entire 
regions are brought into arenas or atmospheres of tension and 
destabilisation, which is not in the interest of the peaceful develop- 
ment of their peoples. 
 
  <br><br>   Increasingly, non-alignment has not only been vindicated 
through experience, but even the staunchest of its former opponets 
appear and profess to be convinced of the relevance and need of 
non-alignment in the current dangerous contemporary international 
situation.  Reiteration of the principles that would serve the cause 
of restoration of detente as well as strengthen the universally 
acknowledged contribution of non-alignment, was contained in 
the Joint Declaration signed by the President of the Republic 
of France and the Prime Minister of India, on the occasion of 
the vist of the French President, Mr. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 
to India in January 1980.  The Declaration, inter alia, referred 
to the inadmissibility of the use of force in international relations, 
intervention or interference in internal affairs of sovereign States 
and the need to prevent further escalations in areas of tensions 
through States refraining from actions which could intensify 
Great Power rivalries and revive the cold war through dangerous 
arms-build-up which are liable to threaten peace and stability 
in sensitive regions.  It reiterated the need to restore conditions 
in which independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all 
States could be preserved and the right of their peoples to freely 
determine their own destiny without outside interference assured. 
                <br><br>               iii 
 
   <br><br>  Finally, it appealed to all States, particularly the most powerful 
ones, to recognise the gravity of the danger and to exert efforts 
to avert it. 
 
   <br><br>  Recent developments in Afghanistan, which came at the end 
of 1979, should be seen in this larger background of deterioration 
of the global and regional environments.  These developments, in 
turn, inevitably heightened global and regional tensions and they 
are a matter of serious concern for the people of India--a concern 
naturally shared by the Government. 
 
  <br><br>   Tensions and problems have existed between neighbours, and 
even inside nations.  However, dangerous dimensions could be 
added when Great Powers try to utilise such situations in their 
quest to gain advantage in their global strategy, or seek to secure 
their interests through intervention and interference.  India has 
close and friendly relations with the Government and the people 
of Afghanistan.  India is deeply concerned and vitally interested 
in the security, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
the traditional non-alignment of friendly Afghanistan.  The Gov- 
ernment of India have repeatedly expressed the hope that the 
people of Afghanistan would be able to resolve their internal pro- 
blems without any outside interference.  India is against the 
presence of foreign troops and bases in any country.  In that 
spirit, the Government of India, which is firmly wedded to this 
principle, have expressed the hope that Soviet forces would with- 
draw from Afghanistan. 
 <br><br>
     Equally, in order to stop further escalation of the situation, 
all States should refrain from actions which could intensify Great 
Power rivalries in the South Asian region and bring back the cold 
war, especially through dangerous arms build-up, liable to threaten 
peace and stability in this sensitive region.  In this context, regret- 
tably, reactive moves have already been started by China, USA, 
and others to assist Pakistan in the augmentation of its military 
capability.  These moves run the risk of converting the sub-conti- 
nent into a theatre of Great Power confrontation and conflict as 
well as threaten the security of India.  Further, it is the firm view 
of the Government of India, based on the unfortunate experiences 
  <br><br>                             iv 
 
<br><br>of the past, that induction of arms into Pakistan has the potential 
of decelerating the process of normalisation, which the Govern- 
ments of India and Pakistan have fostered in the spirit of the Simla 
Agreement. 
 
    <br><br> These views of the Government of India were conveyed at 
the highest levels to Mr. Clark Clifford, the Special Envoy of the 
President of the USA, during the latter's visit to New Delhi in 
January 1980.  Discussions with various other Foreign Ministers 
from West and East Europe, Asia and Africa, have indicated to 
a measure of encouraging response to India's plea that the situa- 
tion arising out of the events in Afghanistan should not be allowed 
to escalate to the detriment of the prospects of peace and sta- 
bility in the sub-continent. 
 
   <br><br>  In keeping with past practice, the Government of the USSR 
welcomed the initiative of high-level consultations after the new 
Government assumed office in India.  When Mr. Gromyko, 
Foreign Minister of the USSR, visited New Delhi in January 
1980, India's concerns were conveyed and the discussions held 
on that occasion helped to create a better understanding.  The 
visit provided an opportunity for reaffirming the stable and 
mutually co-operative relationship obtaining between the two 
countries in diverse fields.  The visit showed that both sides 
shared the conviction that development of Indo-Soviet relations 
is in the longterm interests of peace and stability in the region. 
 
    <br><br> Despite differences of perceptions on some issues, India conti- 
nues to expand and diversify relations to mutual benefit in various 
fields with the USA.  Indeed, the links in a variety of fields bet- 
ween the peoples of India and the United States, sharing in 
common the commitment to the democratic system, form a good 
basis for a cooperative pattern of relationship between the two 
countries, capable of improving the quality of their relationship. 
 
  <br><br>   It is a matter of gratification that the initiative taken by the 
Government of India to consult with India's neighbouring coun- 
tries, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka 
and others through the despatch of Special Envoys of the Prime 
     <br><br>                            v 
<br><br> 
Minister or through high-level visits from these countries to Delhi 
and through diplomatic contacts have resulted in a broad under- 
standing of the dangerous potential inherent in the situation facing 
the region, although perceptions on the measures to be taken 
differ in emphasis.  India's  assurances that it fully respects Pakis- 
tan's sovereignty, territorial integrity as well as the principles of 
non-interference in Pakistan's internal affairs have been reiterated 
by the Foreign Secretary on his visit to Pakistan in January 1980. 
India is not insensitive to Pakistan's concern over the develop- 
ments in the region.  It would be India's endeavour to carry fur- 
ther the dialogue, initiated in January 1980, for an all round 
improvement of India-Pakistan relations, as provided for in the 
Simla Agreement of 1972 to which both countries are committed. 
The consultations carried out on the occasion of the visit to India 
of His Excellency the President of Bangladesh in January 1980, 
provided a basis for constructive action to further promote the 
friendly relations between India and Bangladesh.  In the tradi- 
tional framework of the age-old close friendship between India 
and Bhutan, the visit of His Majesty the King of Bhutan, from 
22--25 February 1980, enhanced the prospects of cooperation 
between the two countries, based on their inter-dependence and 
shared interests.  The visit of His Majesty the King of Nepal, 
from 6--8 March 1980, served to reaffirm the historically close 
relations between India and Nepal and underlined the need for 
constructive bilateral cooperation to the mutual benefit of the 
peoples of both countries.  With all its neighbours, the Govern- 
ment intends to follow a policy of friendship in the full realisa- 
tion that the resources of the region are enormous and should be 
utilised for the welfare of the vast populations, who should be 
allowed to devote their energies to the promotion of regional 
stability and cooperation between the countries of the region. 
 
  <br><br>   Both India and China have expressed desire to improve rela- 
tions between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles. 
To a considerable extent the substantive tasks of translating 
mutual desire into concrete realities for the metual benefit of both 
countries still remain to be undertaken. 
1--784EA/79 
                 <br><br>             vi 
 
   <br><br>  India's traditional links, both political and economic, with 
countries in Africa were further diversified and deepened.  Con- 
sistent with its total opposition to all forms of racist oppression, 
India continued to render material and moral assistance to the 
freedom struggles in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Namibia and South 
Africa.  India welcomed the holding of elections in Zimbabwe 
and the formation of an elected government on the basis of the 
will of the majority of its people.  It offered the new government 
full cooperation in the reconstruction of the country's economy. 
 
  <br><br>   India continued to develop closer ties with the countries of 
West Asia on a bilateral basis, particularly by providing skilled 
manpower and experts to assist them in the task of their develop- 
ment.  It noted with concern that the Camp David Agreements had 
divided the Arab world and not led to the solution of the Pales- 
tinian problem.  It was of the firm belief that a lasting solution 
to the Palestinian question could only be found through vacation 
of Arab lands under the illegal occupation of Israel and meeting 
the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their 
own State.  The resurgence in Iran reflected the determination of 
the people of that country to shape their own destiny, independent 
of outside pressures and influences.  India shares with Iran its 
desire to develop cooperative relations on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit. 
 
    <br><br> In South-East Asia, India strengthened its ties with Vietnam 
and Laos through beneficial cooperation in various fields.  It 
worked towards improving its relations with the ASEAN and its 
member countries to their mutual advantage.  India favours 
regional cooperation based on mutual confidence and understand- 
ing among the States of the region as that would help to reduce 
tension and restore stability in this part of the world. 
 
   <br><br>  In the economic field there was hardly any discernible progress 
in North-South relations.  The UNCTAD-V failed to agree on any 
significant measures aimed at reconstruction of international eco- 
nomic relations.  South-South cooperation, however, received im- 
petus following the adoption of the Arusha Programme of collec- 
tive self-relance and the subsequent resolution at the Non-aligned 
     <br><br>                        vii 
 
<br><br>Summit at Havana on policy guidelines for reinforcing self-reli- 
ance among developing countries.  The Non-aligned countries, as 
usual, played a catalytic role in the field of international economic 
cooperation by adopting a comprehensive action programme on 
economic cooperation among developing countries in different 
fields.  They also adopted a resolution calling for global negotia- 
tions on the subjects of raw materials and energy, trade and deve- 
lopment money and finance.  The call for global negotiation was, 
later adopted, through a resolution, in the General Assembly. 
 
  <br><br>   Simultaneously, preparations for the formulation of the Inter- 
national Development Strategy continued though with very little 
positive results. 
 <br><br>
     India has been playing a significant role in these developments 
by virtue of its being the Chairman of the Group of 77 with effect 
from 1 October and of its representative being elected as the 
Chairman of the Preparatory Committee set up by the General 
Assembly for the New International Development Strategy. 
 
  <br><br>   The new government is determined to lay stress on inter- 
national economic cooperation particularly among developing 
countries.  This is evident from the manifesto of the ruling party 
which inter alia called for agreements with other developing coun- 
tries and among developing countries themselves for strengthening 
their collective self-reliance vis-a-vis developed countries in regard 
to problems of trade, transfer of technology, capital goods and 
resources, etc. 
 
  <br><br>   A recent report presented to the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations, compiled by a body of internationally acknow- 
ledged eminent persons, has estimated that the world devotes 
roughly US $ 450 billion for the arms race against a mere US 
$ 20 billion for aid and investment to combat the age-old ills of 
poverty, disease and hunger, which afflict the overwhelming 
portion of humanity.  This finding dramatically reflects the lop- 
sidedness of priorities in today's troubled world.  Increasing 
sophistication of dangerous armaments enjoy greater priority 
  <br><br>                              viii 
 <br><br>
than early realisation of complete, universal and effective disarma- 
ment.  The atmosphere of meaningful international cooperation 
for economic and social development has given way to an era of 
confrontation between the developed and the developing, in a 
world of shrinking material resources.  The approach of solution 
to disputes, where they exist, through peaceful negotiations, has 
been increasingly replaced by an alarming militarisation of thought 
and discourse in the capitals of influential countries.  The recru- 
descence of deep military suspicions in an era of assured annihila- 
tion, and a build-up of the old cold war atmosphere, characterise 
the present phase of USA-USSR relations.  The prime concern 
of all countries should be to bring back the realisation of the im- 
mutable logic of detente, which needs to be further universalised. 
For this, a vital factor is the progress towards disarmament.  India 
has throughout stressed the importance of cessation of the produc- 
tion and use of nuclear weapons and a ban on their testing by all 
States.  Pointing out the link between disarmament and develop- 
ment, it has emphasised that resources spent on armaments could 
be used for development purposes.  Mankind is crying out for 
peace, stability and development.  Steady commitment to and 
pursuit of these goals must be India's objective.

<tr><td>   CHAPTER I 
 
     <br><br>                 INDIA'S NEIGHBOURS 
 
  <br><br>   The traditionally friendly relations between India and 
Afghanistan continued through 1979-80.  India considers the 
domestic political developments in Afghanistan during the year 
as the internal affairs of Afghanistan.  India earnestly desires 
that the people of Afghanistan would be enabled to work out 
their own future, in accordance with their genius and that 
Afghanistan would continue to strongly maintain it's non-align- 
ment and independence, free from outside interference. 
 
  <br><br>   A Cultural delegation visited Kabul on the occasion of the first 
anniversary of the April Revolution and participated in the cele- 
brations. 
 <br><br>
     In May 1979 a UNIDO-sponsored solidarity meeting of the 
Ministers of Industries of developing countries took place and 
India sent a delegation led by the Minister of State for Industries. 
As a result of the deliberations India undertook to prepare feasi- 
bility studies for a number of priority projects identified by the 
Afghan authorities as grant-in-aid.  This bilateral co-operation 
was within the context of India's commitment to concepts of 
TCDC and ECDC. (Technical Cooperation among Developing 
Countries and Economic Cooperation among Developing 
Countries). 
 
  <br><br>   India's technical and economic co-operation in fields such as 
medicine, small industries, mini-hydel projects etc. as also cultural 
co-operation with Afghanistan under the Indian Technical and 
Economic Co-operation Programme and the Cultural Exchanges 
Programme respectively, continued with vigour as in the past. 
 
   <br><br>  Endeavours in the direction of taking India's relations with 
Pakistan further on the road to normalisation continued unabated 
and progress was achieved in some fields.  Through high level 
dialogue between leaders and officials of the two countries on a 
number of bilateral political, commercial and other functional 
day to day issues, through consultations and co-operation between 
their delegates in international conferences and through greater 
people to people exchanges, India tried to generate mutual under- 
standing and goodwill.

                               pg2<br><br>
 
     India refrained from commenting on Pakistan's internal affairs 
even though there was considerable pressure, both at home and 
abroad, to express the Government's views on the developments 
within Pakistan.  India's principled stand of not passing any 
judgement on its neighbours' internal affairs induced a sense of 
maturity in its relations with Pakistan and that this stand was 
appreciated by that country. 
 
  <br><br>   Bilateral discussions between the Prime Minister and External 
Affairs Minister of India with the President and Foreign Affairs 
Adviser of Pakistan were held during international conferences and 
views on several bilateral and international issues were exchang- 
ed. For the first time, the Foreign Secretaries of the two coun- 
tries met in May 1979 without any specific agenda or problem 
thus initiating the process of periodic consultations to review 
Indo-Pak relations. 
 
   <br><br>  As a gesture of  goodwill towards Pakistan, on its leaving the 
CENTO, India supported its entry into the Non-Aligned Move- 
ment, both at the Bureau meeting at Colombo and the Summit 
meeting at Havana.  On a number of knotty issues like the 
nuclear question, there were exchange of letters between Prime 
Minister Morarji Desai and President Zia-ul-Haq in February- 
March and again, in August, between him and Prime Minister 
Charan Singh.  This matter was also discussed when the Minister 
of External Affairs Shri S. N. Mishra met President Zia-ul-Haq 
and Foreign Affairs Adviser of Pakistan Mr. Agha Shahi at 
Havana and New York in September 1979. 
 
  <br><br>   On the occasion of the assumption of office by the new 
Government in India, in January 1980, a warm and friendly 
message of greetings was sent to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi 
from President Zia-ul-Haq.  The message recalled Pakistan's 
commitment to the Simla Agreement and hoped for acceleration 
of the process of normalisation of relations between India and 
Pakistan.  In her reply, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi express- 
ed her happiness with the reiterated commitment to the Simla 
Agreement, which she herself had concluded.  Further, she 
fully reciprocated the desire to strengthen Indo-Pakistan rela- 
tions. 
 
  <br><br>   Shri R. D. Sathe, Foreign Secretary. paid a return visit to 
Pakistan in February 1980 to discuss further improvements in 
relations between India and Pakistan.  He was received by 
President Zia-ul-Haq to whom he delivered a letter from Prime 
                          <br><br>pg3<br><br>
 
     Minister Indira Gandhi.  In the course of his talks with the 
Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and other leaders, which included 
a review of bilateral matters, the regional and international situa- 
tion, the opportunity was taken to re-affirm India's commitment 
to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Pakistan and India's adherence to the principle of non-interfer- 
ence in Pakistan's internal affairs, as provided for in the Simla 
Agreement.  The Pakistan side appreciated the opportunity 
afforded by the Foreign Secretary's visit for a free and frank 
exchange of views which were considered useful in promoting a 
better understanding of each other's view points. 
 
  <br><br>   Attempts to draw up a new trade agreement were made and 
an experts' delegation visited Islamabad on 15 September to 
identify items for trade with Pakistan.  Pending the finalisation 
of a new trade agreement, Indo-Pak trade continued, though the 
volume of trade declined in the absence of an agreement.  India 
has stated its desire for stepping up of economic relations to 
mutual benefit with Pakistan. 
 
   <br><br>  In pursuance of the agreement to open consulates of the two 
countries in Karachi and Bombay respectively, the office of the 
Consulate General of India, Karachi, started functioning with 
effect from February 1979.  Up to the end of January 1980, 
the Consulate had granted 1,61,289 visas to Pakistani nationals 
for visits to various places in India and the total number of visas 
granted by the Indian Embassy at Islamabad and Consulate at 
Karachi, from January 1979 to January 1980, was 2,14,526. 
Between the Embassy of India, Islamabad and the Consulate 
General of India, Karachi 100,000 visas have been granted by 
Jul 25, 1979 and a return I.A.C. ticket on the Delhi-Lahore 
sector was awarded to the 100,000th visa holder in Pakistan. 
A major step towards the settlement of payments problems bet- 
ween the Governments of the two countries was taken when the 
two Governments agreed to revive Indo-Pakistan Agreement of 
July 1959 regarding payment of pensions to the retired employees 
of the Governments of India and Pakistan who had migrated from 
one country to the other during the period 1 July 1955 to 31 
December 1960. 
  <br><br>   Four jathas, consisting of about 4,000 Sikh pilgrims, visited 
Pakistan and pilgrim parties from Pakistan visited Muslim shrines 
in India.  For the first time, a Hindu pilgrim party, consisting 
of about 90 members, was allowed by the Pakistan Government 
to visit the Hindu shrine of Sant Shadaram at Hayat Pitafi. 
               <br><br>pg4<br><br>
 
     Exchanges in the field of culture and sports continued.  Some 
well-known Pakistani poets participated in the Shankar-Shad 
Indo-Pakistani Mushaira in March 1979 and some Pakistani 
poets also took part in the Ghalib Centenary Celebrations, orga- 
nised by Aiwaan-e-Ghalib in India.  The visit of Pakistani 
cricket team to India (November 1979 to January 1980), after 
a gap of 18 years, generated tremendous enthusiasm and good- 
will in India for Pakistan and provided opportunity for more 
than 1500 people to come over from Pakistan to witness some 
of the matches. 
 
   <br><br>  India continued its efforts to create a climate of confidence 
and trust for conducting a mutually cooperative and meaningful 
relationship with Nepal.  During the period under review, both 
India and Nepal were preoccupied with internal developments. 
However, despite their problems, the fact that the King of Nepal 
visited India in September 1979, showed the close friendship and 
confidence between the two countries. 
 
 <br><br>    The visit of the King helped towards building a relationship 
of confidence and trust.  The enormous potential of rivers flow- 
ing from Nepal to India, which could be harnessed for mutual 
benefit, was discussed and it was agreed to expedite studies, etc., 
On some important multipurpose hydel projects like Karnali, 
Pancheshwar and Rapti.  Discussions were also held on various 
topics of mutual interest.  This reflected the trust, understand- 
ing and mutual cooperation in Indo-Nepal relations. 
 
 <br><br>    In keeping with the tradition of frequent high level continuing 
dialogue between Nepal and India, the Foreign Secretary visited 
Nepal from 17 to 19 February 1980.  His Majesty the King of 
Nepal is expected to pay an official visit to India in March 1980. 
 
 <br><br>    India continued to extend financial and technical assistance 
for development programmes in Nepal.  An amount of Rs. 14.60 
crores was earmarked for meeting expenditure on schemes 
in hand during the current year.  The major projects for which 
assistance was extended are the Central Sector of the Mahendra 
Rajmarg and the Devighat Hydro-electric Project, which is being 
executed on a turnkey basis by India.  It is also expected that 
aerial survey of the Dulalghat-Dhankuta road will be completed 
during the current financial year.  An Agreement for the expan- 
sion of the Paropkar Hospital in Nepal was signed under which 
Rs. 17.65 lakhs was given to the authorities for carrying out 
                       <br><br>pg5<br><br>
 
the work which is expected to be completed in 1981.  Letters 
concerning Indian assistance were also exchanged; extensions of 
the Agreement relating to the supply of iodised salt to Nepal and 
the improvement of the Industrial Estate in Patan Phase IV were 
concluded.  In addition, feasibility studies for a number of pro- 
jects which the Government of India had agreed to set up in 
Nepal were completed.  Amongst these were the Joint sector 
cement plant at Lakshmipur in Nepal and the three projects to 
be set up by HMT (International), viz.  Regional Training Insti- 
tute at Nepalganj, the Production-oriented Polytechnic at 
Hetauda and a Common Facility Centre at Butwal.  The feasibi- 
lity study of the paper and pulp factory to be set up in Nepal 
is also expected to be finalised shortly. 
 
     <br><br>Indo-Bhutanese relations based on trust, confidence and under- 
standing continued to grow and develop to the mutual advant- 
age of both countries.  The Foreign Secretary Shri J. S. Mehta, 
visited Calcutta in August 1979 to meet the King of Bhutan.  At 
the Non-aligned Summit at Havana, the Minister of External 
Affairs Shri S. N. Mishra and the Foreign Secretary Shri J. S. 
Mehta exchanged views on various matters with the King of 
Bhutan.  Senior officials from the Government of India visited 
Bhutan to discuss progress of on-going projects and to identify 
fields for enhanced cooperation in future developmental pro- 
grammes.  All these contacts have led to reaffirmation of the 
unique links of friendship and inter-dependence and consolida- 
tion of the relationship between the two countries.  Cultural 
exchanges between India and Bhutan were maintained.  During 
1979-80, five delegations are expected to visit India, important 
of which being the 15-member National Assembly, Village 
Headmen/Farmers and Agricultural Extension Workers and 
Students/Teachers. His Majesty the King of Bhutan is expected 
to pay an official visit to India in February 1980. 
 
 <br><br>    India has played a highly important and significant role in 
Bhutan's developmental activities for the past two decades or 
so. Three Five-Year Plans from 1961 onwards, involving an 
outlay of Rs. 76.50 crores, have been successfully implemented 
with Indian assistance.  These development plans have transform- 
ed the economy of Bhutan, apart from providing the base for 
future programmes for her socio-economic progress.  Bhutan's 
Fourth Five-Year Plan, involving Government of India's assist- 
ance worth Rs. 70.30 crores, is due to be completed in March 
1981. 
                <br><br>pg6<br><br>
 
     Apart from the Plan expenditure, India is constructing a 
major Hydro-electric Project at Chukha, which on completion 
in mid-1980's, would produce 336 MWs of power.  The Chukha 
Hydel Project is being financed by India on a grant-cum-loan 
basis in the ratio of 60 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. 
The project has made steady progress.  In addition, with India's 
assistance, a Cement Project at Penden with an installed capa- 
city of 300 tonnes per day has been completed at a cost of 
Rs. 13.50 crores.  The project is expected to go into produc- 
tion soon. 
 
  <br><br>   India is also implementing a comprehensive Lift Irriga- 
tion Scheme at Gaylegphug in Southern Bhutan at a cost of 
Rs. 2.62 crores.  It is a turnkey project and, on completion, 
will provide irrigational facilities for agriculture and allied pur- 
poses to the inhabitants of the area.  Similarly, an Indo-Bhutan 
Microwave Link is making steady progress. 
 
  <br><br>   Apart from providing financial assistance for Bhutan's Deve- 
lopment plans, India continues to provide experts and specialists 
in diverse fields, including industries, road construction, minerals, 
geological explorations, telecommunications and forestry deve- 
lopment, etc.  Many Bhutanese students are receiving higher 
education in India with our assistance and scholarships, etc. 
 
  <br><br>   Indo-Bangladesh relations during the year under review pre- 
sented a mixed picture.  The year began on a hopeful note with 
the former Prime Minister's visit but ended somewhat uncer- 
tainly when reports of firing on the Tripura border started com- 
ing.  The issue involved appeared trivial and could have been 
easily resolved if the boundary constituted by a shifting river had 
been demarcated in this sector.  This incident brought home 
the realisation on both sides that in order to have a tranquil 
border. demarcation of disputed sectors should be expeditiously 
completed.  The firing in this sector, however, ended abruptly 
on 8 January 1980. 
 
    <br><br> President Ziaur Rahman was invited by the Executive Director 
of UNIDO-III to address the Conference on 22 January 
1980 as a special invitee.  As the new government would have 
assumed office after recent elections, it was felt that this visit 
could give an opportunity to President Zia to meet Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi.  A bilateral dimension was, therefore, 
added to this visit and President Zia arrived at New Delhi a 
                        <br><br>pg7<br><br>
 
day earlier and was accorded the usual honours as on a bilateral 
official visit.  The visit enabled the two leaders to have a gene- 
ral exchange of views on all matters of mutual interest. 
 
   <br><br>  Little progress was recorded towards an agreed scheme for 
augmentation of Ganga waters during the deliberations of the 
Indo-Bangladesh Joint River Commission held during the course 
of the year. 
 <br><br>
     In bilateral economic relations, a positive trend was shown 
by India's exports to Bangladesh.  In May 1979, India agreed 
to loan 200,000 tonnes of foodgrains to Bangladesh,  to tide 
her over the consequences of the severe drought that affected the 
sub-continent. 
 
    <br><br> Another hopeful sign was the ad-hoc cultural exchanges that 
took place during the past year. 
 
   <br><br>  India and Burma exchanged a number of delegations to 
explore avenues of closer cooperation.  A two-member delega- 
tion of Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of India Limited 
visited Rangoon in August and held discussions with Burma 
Ports Corporation to explore possibilities of supply of coal to 
that country. A five-member delegation of Basic Chemicals 
Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Exports Promotion Council 
(CHEMEXCIL) visited Burma in November and held talks with 
the officials of the Ministry of Trade, Myanma Export-Import 
Corporation and those connected with Chemical Industry and 
Pharmaceutical Corporations.  From the Burmese side, a four- 
member Trade Delegation of the Myanma Export-Import Corpo- 
ration visited India in November to promote sales of Burmese 
beans and pulses. 
 
   <br><br>  India offered technical training facilities to Burmese experts 
in diverse fields, such as, banking and small-scale industry.  Burma 
made increasing use of such facilities by sending trainees  to 
India and inviting Indian experts to Burma. 
 
   <br><br>  In the cultural field, India presented a set of books to Burma 
and an Indian Universities Football Team visited that country 
in October-November to play friendly matches. 
 
   <br><br>  President Ne Win sent messages of sympathy to the President 
of India for the victims of cyclones and floods in various parts 
of the country. 
                    <br><br>pg8<br><br>
 
     India expressed concern at the withdrawal of Burma from 
the Non-aligned Movement at the Summit Conference held at 
Havana.  It is hoped that Burma would rejoin the Movement 
and make valuable contributions to it. 
 
    <br><br> India's relations with Sri Lanka continued to remain warm 
and cordial.  In February 1979, Prime Minister Morarji Desai 
was invited to be the chief guest at the Independence Day cele- 
brations of Sri Lanka.  He was shown great warmth and friend- 
ship by the Sri Lankan people which symbolised their feelings to- 
wards India. 
 
  <br><br>   Indo-Sri Lanka economic cooperation continued to grow at 
a satisfactory pace.  In addition to the two on-going major 
projects, namely, the Micro-wave Link and the Animal Husbandry 
Project, several other new projects, which were originally 
agreed to at the last Joint Commission meeting held in June 
1978 were finalised and implemented.  It is heartening to note 
that Sri Lanka has continued to display confidence in the 
utility of economic cooperation with India. 
 
   <br><br>  In the cultural field also, there were a number of exchanges 
covering sports, performing arts, music and dance. 
 
   <br><br>  Indo-Maldivian relations also remained friendly during the 
year under review.  Several requests for technical experts includ- 
ing teachers, doctors, etc. were received and met during the past 
year.  A number of places in Indian educational institutions were 
also made available to Maldivian students upon their Govern- 
ment's request.  A Maldivian pilot completed his commercial 
pilot's course with the IA.  The year ended on a hopeful note 
with the signing of an Air Services Agreement at Male which 
is expected to increase the existing substantial cooperation bet- 
ween the IAC and Maldivian International Airways.

friendly contacts by India at different levels with these countries. 
 <br><br>
     India maintained a dialogue with the ASEAN and submitted 
a memorandum to the ASEAN Secretariat indicating possible 
areas of cooperation with that Association.  A study of the 
memorandum in depth is being made by the Expert Committees

his visit to Kuala Lumpur in February 1979.  The Malaysian 
Minister discussed ways and means of developing cooperation 
between India and Malaysia in the field of Radio, TV and other 
mass media. 
 <br><br>
     Apart from over 5,000 Malaysian students studying in Indian 
Universities and establishments for various courses, Malaysian 
organisations evinced increasing interest in sponsoring their per- 
sonnel for training in Indian scientific and technical establish- 
ments.  The Malaysian Petroleum Organisation, Petronas, deput- 
ed its engineers for training with ONGC.  Other organisations 
nominated their candidates for training in such fields as soil- 
testing/survey, fire safety, social security, pepper and onion 
cultivation, meteorology, rural development and handicrafts, etc.

ties.  India rendered assistance for implementation of various 
projects in Vietnam and supplied materials, machinery and cere- 
als bought against credits already extended to that  country. 
Satisfactory progress is being maintained towards the setting up 
of a Rice Research Institute and Buffalo Breeding Centre.

  <br><br>   Visits by journalists were also exchanged between the two 
countries.  A radio/TV team visited Vietnam in December to 
finalise arrangements for cooperation. 
 
    <br><br> The President and the Prime Minister of Laos transited 
through India on two occasions during the year.  This provided 
an opportunity for exchange of views on various problems. 
 
   <br><br>  India agreed to give textiles worth Rs. 3 lakhs to Laos at the 
request of that country.  A request for setting up of a Buffalo 
Breeding Centre in Laos is also being processed. 
 
   <br><br>  The momentum generated by the visit of the Australian 
Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm D. Fraser to India in January- 
February 1979, continued to guide bilateral relations with that 
 
      <br><br>pg13<br><br>
 
country.  The First Assistant Secretary in the Australian Depart- 
ment of Science, Mr. J. P. Lonergan, visited India in March- 
April and signed a programme of scientific cooperation in the 
field of agriculture. 
 
   <br><br>  The eleventh round of Indo-Australian bilateral talks, at

ments in Afghanistan and in the region.  There was general agree- 
ment that the Great Power interference was not in the interest of 
the smaller countries. 
 
 <br><br>    Friendly relations with New Zealand were marked by exchange

                          <br><br> CHAPTER III 
 
                         <br><br>   EAST ASIA 
 
    <br><br> The year was marked by functional exchanges between India 
and China  in a number of fields with a view to develop coopera- 
tion on the basis of mutual benefit, reciprocity and equality. 
 
   <br><br>  China participated on a fairly big scale in the Indian Inter- 
national Trade Fair held in New Delhi in November-December 
1979.  At the same time, a Chinese Trade delegation led by the 
President of the Chinese Council for Promotion of International 
Trade, visited India for two-weeks as guests of the Federation 
of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.  The visit is 
expected to give a further stimulus to trade between India and 
China which continued to increase in volume.  The main item 
of India's export to China consisted of 30,000 bales of cotton 
while India imported a sizeable quantity of antibiotics from 
China. 
 
  <br><br>   A five-member Chinese Press delegation visited India in 
October.  This, as well as the Trade delegation, were in response 
to an Indian invitation and were in reciprocation of the visits to 
China in 1978 of their Indian counterparts.  The Chinese delega- 
tion particularly emphasised scope for cooperation in the fields 
of family planning and agriculture between the two countries. 
Later a Chinese Agriculture delegation, invited by International 
Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) toured 
India as a guest of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. 
 
  <br><br>   A number of leading Indian journalists visited China during 
the year.  They were told by the Chinese officials of China's 
continued desire to develop friendly relations with India.  Hope 
was expressed that differences about certain recent developments 
in the international scene would not affect the evolving India-China 
relations. 
 
 <br><br>    Several Indian experts in various fields visited China during 
the year under the auspices of concerned United Nations agencies. 
Many Chinese delegations also came to attend international 
conferences in India. 
 
   <br><br>  While India welcomed the progressive development of func- 
tional exchanges, the Government of India, through diplomatic 
 
                    <br><br>pg15<br><br>
                        pg16<br><br>
 
channels, reiterated its view that the full normalisation of relations 
required a satisfactory solution of the border problem.  The 
Chinese Government, on its part, stressed its desire to improve 
relations with India on the  basis of the Five Principles. 
 
  <br><br>   On the occasion of the constitution of the new Government, 
Premier Hua Guofeng and Foreign Minister Huang Hua sent 
congratulatory messages to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and 
the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, 
respectively.  The message from the Chinese Premier expressed 
happiness that relations between China and India had improved 
and developed over the last few years and hoped that this trend 
would continue to develop in the interest of peace and stability 
in Asia.  In reply, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi hoped for co- 
operation between India and China on the basis of the Five 
Principles. 
 
  <br><br>   Relations between India and Japan continued to be charac- 
terised by their mutual desire to promote greater understanding. 
Official consultations held during the visit of Mr. Takashmia, 
Deputy Foreign Minister, to India in May 1979, confirmed the 
common interest of both countries in maintaining peace and 
stability in Asia.  Bilateral trade talks were held when a Japanese 
Trade delegation visited India in September. 
 
 <br><br>    The Japanese Government organised a symposium on India 
and Japan, in coordination with the Indian Council of Social 
Sciences Research, in New Delhi in November 1979.  It was 
the first time that a symposium of this kind was organised in the 
country.  It brought Indian and Japanese intellectuals together 
to discuss the roles of the two countries in Asia.  The discussion 
ranged from Indo-Japanese cooperation in  science and technology 
and  economics to sociology and politics. 
 <br><br>
     In its meetings held at New Delhi, also in November 1979, 
the  Indo-Japan Committee for Economic Studies identified a 
number of areas where India could learn from Japan's experience. 
The Committee decided to carry out studies of long-term perspec- 
tives regarding economic relations and inter-actions between 
India and Japan. 
 
   <br><br>  India continued to express itself in favour of the re-unification 
of the two Koreas through peaceful and bilateral means without 
outside interference.  Friendly relations were maintained with 
both, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic 
                <br><br>pg17<br><br>
 
of Korea.  Shock and regret was expressed at the assassination 
of President Park Chung Hee of the Republic of Korea. 
 
    <br><br> India continued to have good relations with the People's 
Republic of Mongolia.  A high-level delegation from Mongolia 
transited through India, on 30 November, on its way to Indo-

Council of Ministers, and included Mr. Mangalyn Dugersuren, 
the Foreign Minister, Mr. Sonomyn Luvsangombo, Deputy 
Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Mr. Damdinguin 
Gombojav, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian 
People's Revolutionary Party, Mr. J. Batmunkh and Mr. Duger-

                     <br><br> WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA 
 
    <br><br> There was strong criticism in the region of the Camp David 
Agreements which led to even greater disunity in the Arab world. 
While expressing concern about the sharp divisions and resulting 
tensions, India, in its reaction to these developments, firmly stated 
that the Palestinian question was central to the entire dispute and 
unless that was resolved to the full satisfaction of the Palestinians 
themselves, there could not be lasting peace in the region.  Con- 
sistent with its long standing position on the Arab-Israeli dispute, 
India reaffirmed that a comprehensive settlement of the dispute 
should ensure vacation of all occupied territories by Israel and 
the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, 
including their right to return to their homeland where they can 
set up a  State of their own. 
 
   <br><br>  At the invitation of Minister of Works and Housing, the 
Syrian Minister of Waqf visited India in January 1979.  This 
visit provided him an opportunity to appreciate the secular aspects 
of the Indian policy wherein followers of all religions enjoyed 
full freedom to pursue their faiths and beliefs.  The Syrian 
Minister of Tourism and Transport also visited India and held 
extensive discussions with the Minister of Civil Aviation and the 
Minister of Railways. 
 
  <br><br>   The Crown Prince of Jordan visited Delhi in March 1979 and 
had a meeting with Prime Minister Morarji Desai.  Various 
aspects of Indo-Jordanian bilateral relations, including the grow- 
ing climate of economic cooperation, were reviewed.  The Crown 
Prince appreciated India's policy on the West Asian dispute. 
 
  <br><br>   The Vice-President of Egypt, Mr. Hosny Mubarak visited 
New Delhi in May, with a message from President Sadat for 
Prime Minister Morarji Desai.  This was followed by the visit 
of Dr. Boutros Ghali, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, in 
August 1979.  Their visits provided India with an opportunity 
to understand the Egyptian viewpoint on regional and interna- 
tional issues. 
 
   <br><br>  The visit of Shri A. B. Vajpayee to Kuwait, UAE, Syria and 
Iraq, during May 1979, was the first by an Indian Minister of

External Affairs to the Gulf since 1973 when Shri Swaran Singh 
had visited the Gulf region.  This confirmed the warmth, under- 
standing and desire for friendship and cooperation between India 
and these countries.  Earlier in the same month, Shri S. Kundu, 
Minister of State of External Affairs, had paid a successful visit 
to Bahrain and Oman. 
 
    <br><br> The Union Minister for Labour, Shri Fazlur Rahman, visited 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman, during October 1979, 
to discuss the problems and prospects of Indian workers in these 
countries. 
 
   <br><br>  The Minister for Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri 
A. Bala Pajanoor, paid a two-day visit to Abu Dhabi to discuss 
with the UAE authorities the question of oil supplies to India 
during 1980.  The quantum of oil supply to India during 1979 
and 1980 was also discussed during the visit of Dr Otaiba, UAE 
Petroleum Minister and Chairman of the OPEC, to India in April 
1979. 
 
  <br><br>   The second meeting of the Indo-Arab Joint Council was held 
in Abu Dhabi in early October 1979.  A nine-member Indian 
business delegation, led by Shri H. S. Singhania, President of 
FICCI participated in this meeting.  The Handloom and Handi- 
crafts Export Promotion Council organised a Gold Jewellery 
exhibition-cum-sale in Abu Dhabi in November 1979.  Indian. 
jewellery worth Rs 1.2 crores was sold during the course of the 
exhibition.  Air-India organised a fashion show on this occasion. 
 
   <br><br>  Steady progress was witnessed in the growth of Indo-Iraqi 
economic relations which were marked by export of a range of 
commodities and projects to Iraq on the one hand and readiness 
of the Government of Iraq to meet India's oil requirements on 
the other.  Iraq agreed to the supply of 6 million tonnes of crude 
to India which was 2.5 million tonnes in excess to their earlier 
commitment.  This made up, to some extent, the shortfall in 
India's imports due to the developments in Iran. 
 
  <br><br>   The news of the unprecedented terrorist seizure of the Grand 
Mosque in Mecca, on Nov 20, 1979, was received by India 
with the utmost shock and indignation.  India strongly condemned 
the terrorist action and expressed sympathy and concern about 
the safety of the devout pilgrims to the holy shrine in Mecca. 
There were numerous protest marches and meetings organized 
in various cities of India deploring the incident. 
                       <br><br>pg20<br><br>
 
     India continued to have cordial and friendly relations with 
the Republic of Yemen and Peoples Democratic Republic of 
Yemen.  Indian technical experts including doctors continued to 
assist the two countries in various fields.  Many Indian firm 
were engaged for a Number of projects including construction 
work, hotel management and air-craft maintenance in the Yemen 
Arab Republic.  There were increasing commercial exchanges 
with both the countries and India emerged as a major trading 
partner of the Yemen Arab Republic. 
 
  <br><br>   The visit of the Somali Foreign Minister Dr. Abdo Rehman 
Jama Barre to India from 31 March to 4 April promoted friendly 
relations with that country.  His visit provided opportunity for 
exploring areas of further cooperation between India and Somalia. 
A Cultural Agreement was signed during the visit. 
 
   <br><br>  There was a welcome spurt in high level contacts between 
India and Algeria.  Apart from a large number of technical and 
high powered delegations, the visits from Algeria included one 
by the Algerian Minister of Heavy Industry, Mr. Mohamed 
Liassine and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Transport 
of Algeria.  The Vice-President, Shri M. Hidayatullah, represented 
India at the 25th Anniversary celebrations of the Algerian Revolu- 
tion in November 1979.  Prior to this, in June 1979 the Minister 
of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, had visited Algeria and 
held discussions with his counterpart and the Algerian President 
on matters of mutual interest.  The subjects of intensive co- 
operation between the two countries were identified in the fields 
of railways, energy, higher education and scientific research as 
well as industrial joint ventures.  The question of supply of crude 
oil from Algeria, on a long-term basis, was also discussed during 
these high level visits.  The level of India's exports to Algeria 
increased from a negligible amount to approximately Rupees six 
to eight crores and projects and consultancy contracts worth 
Rupees 28 crores are being executed in Algeria by the Indian 
companies. 
 
  <br><br>   The Minister of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shri 
H. N. Bahuguna, visited Libya from 8 to 10 April 1979 to explore 
the possibility of Libya supplying oil to India.  Libya agreed to 
supply 2 million tonnes of oil in 1979 and 2.5 million tonnes 
each in 1980 and 1981.  The first shipment of Libyan oil for 
India was shipped in the third week of April 1979. 
 
  <br><br>   Shri Sikandar Bakht, Minister for Works, Housing and Reha- 
bilitation, visited Libya from 17 to 20 June 1979.  During his 
                  <br><br>pg21<br><br>
 
 
visit, he reviewed the progress of projects undertaken by the 
Indian Companies in Libya. 
 
  <br><br>   Indian companies continued to receive patronage from the 
Libyan authorities and important contracts and projects worth 
nearly Rs. 1000 crores were awarded to Indian public and private 
sector undertakings.  It is estimated that nearly 15000 Indians 
(labour and experts) are currently working in Libya. 
 
    <br><br> The Hindustan Steel Works Construction Limited signed their 
first construction contract in Libya in January 1979, for the con- 
struction of 28 school buildings in Western Libya valued at US 
$30 million.  Another contract worth about US $60 million for a 
housing programme was also signed. 
 
   <br><br>  The second session of the Indo-Libyan Joint Commission was 
held at New Delhi, from 2 to 6 July 1979, to review the progress 
and implementation of the Indo-Libyan protocol on economic, 
commercial and other matters.  A number of fresh projects in the 
field of civil construction, industry, agriculture and trade were 
identified.  An agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation. 
between India and Libya was initialled at the end of the session. 
 
  <br><br>   The Minister of State of External Affairs, Shri S. Kundu, 
visited Tunisia in 1979.  He met the Tunisian Prime Minister 
Mr. Hedi Nouira and also the Secretary General and the Acting 
Foreign Minister Mr. Taieb Sahbani.  The discussions held 
revealed mutual understanding and identity of views on various 
international issues.  The Tunisian Secretary General for Foreign 
Affairs Mr. Taieb Sahbani visited India in June.  He suggested 
the need of frequent exchange of visits with a view to enlarge 
trade and commercial links. 
 
  <br><br>   Morocco seemed to be keen on developing friendly relations 
with India particularly after the unfortunate statement of the 
former Moroccan Ambassador in India, Mr. Sadaani.  The 
Government of Morocco took note of the strong reaction of the 
Government of India on this subject and recalled their Ambassador 
from India.  More recently, a Moroccan delegation headed by 
the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Mr. 
Abderrahmane Baddou, and consisting of the Directors of Cultural 
and Economic Affairs in the Foreign Office, visited India, from 3 
to 10 December 1979.  It held negotiations to finalise an econo- 
mic and scientific cooperation agreement and a cultural agreement 
The text of the economic agreement was finalised at the official 
                           <br><br>pg22<br><br>
 
level and the cultural agreement was initialled by the officials of 
the two sides. 
 <br><br>
     India viewed the revolution in Iran as a reflection of Iran's 
quest for identity and national self-assertion and a desire to 
charter an independent course without outside Big Power influence. 
In this context, it is gratifying that Iran looks forward to improv- 
ing relations in diverse fields with India, a desire which is fully 
reciprocated. 
 
   <br><br>  An unofficial goodwill delegation, led by Shri Asoka Mehta, 
visited Iran in March 1979 and established contacts with the new 
Iranian leaders who appreciated the goodwill visit and reciprocated 
the greetings and good wishes which the delegation brought from 
the Government and the people of India. 
 <br><br>
     India welcomed Iran's withdrawal from the CENTO and its 
decision to join the Non-Aligned Movement. 
 
 <br><br>    Because of Iran's decision to contain the growing unemploy- 
ment problem in Iran, it decided to dispense with the services of 
foreign nationals.  This led to the bulk of skilled, semi-skilled 
and unskilled Indian workers, who were in Iran, to leave Iran. 
However, in fields like medical services, etc., where skills are 
lacking in Iran, or where internal resources are not sufficient to 
meet the developmental requirements, Iran has turned towards 
India to fill the gap.  It is planned to recruit about 1,000 Indian 
medical and paramedical personnel and an Iranian delegation 
visited India in November 1979 to recruit the first batch of Indian 
doctors and para-medical personnel to cater to Iran's immediate 
requirements. 
 
  <br><br>   There has been a gradual pick-up in bilateral economic rela- 
tions and, of late, there have been more trade enquiries in a 
wide range of items.  These are being explored.  Iran continues 
to be a reliable source of supply of oil to India. 
 
  <br><br>   During the year, there has been great pressure from Iranian 
students to enrol in Indian universities.

                        <br><br>     CHAPTER V 
 
                  <br><br>   AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA) 
 
  <br><br>   International attention was focussed on Southern Africa during 
the year in view of the rapid political developments relating to 
Rhodesia (Zimbabwe).  India's policies towards the countries 
of this region were firmly based on its traditional and total opposi- 
tion to racist oppression.  It strongly condemned the illegal and 
fraudulent elections held in Rhodesia in April 1979 under the 
terms of the so-called "internal settlement" and extended moral 
support and material assistance to Zimbabwe liberation Move- 
ment.  At the same time it emphasised that Britain should assume 
its constitutional responsibilities in Rhodesia and grant it indepen- 
dence on the basis of majority rule.  India supported British 
proposals made at the Conference of the Commonwealth Heads 
of Government held at Lusaka in August 1979 and emphasised 
the need for their urgent implementation.  The proposals envi- 
saged the holding of a constitutional conference for Zimbabwe in 
order to reach a lasting settlement involving all parties to the 
conflict, the adoption of a democratic constitution that would 
pave the way for the formation of a government chosen through 
free and fair elections properly supervised under the authority of 
the U.K. government and through Commonwealth Observers. 
India welcomed the successful conclusion of the Conference subse- 
quently held for this purpose at London as constituting the first 
major achievement of the process initiated at the Lusaka meeting 
towards the emergence of an independent democratic Zimbabwe. 
Shri Rajeshwar Dayal, a former Indian diplomat accepted invita- 
tion to act as Chairman of the Commonwealth Observers Group 
set up by the Commonwealth Secretary-General for Election in 
Rhodesia.  Following the London Conference and the passage of 
a Resolution by the United Nations Security Council recommend- 
ing lifting of economic sanctions against Rhodesia, India decided 
to lift the ban on its economic relations with that country and 
to re-open the Indian Mission at Salisbury. 
 
  <br><br>   India expressed its deep concern over the move by South 
Africa to install an "interim government" of the puppet Turnhalle 
Alliance to thwart the establishment of an independent Namibia 
based on a genuine majority rule.  The Minister of External 
Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, in a message in connection with 
 
         <br><br>pg23<br><br>
                pg24<br><br>
 
the observance of the International Year of Solidarity with the 
people of Namibia in May 1979, re-affirmed India's whole- 
heated support and commitment to the heroic struggle of the 
Namibian people for the liberation of their country.  He noted 
that the United Nations had a direct responsibility for leading 
Namibia to national independence on the basis of majority rules. 
India continued to extend moral and material support to the South 
West African People's Organisation (SW APO) fighting for the 
independence of Namibia. 
 
  <br><br>   India continued to give moral support and material assistance 
to the liberation movement in South Africa in its struggle against 
the infamous policy of apartheid.  The decision to confer the 
Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding for 
1979 on the renowned South African freedom fihter Nelson 
Mandela, reflected the traditional deep commitment of the Indian 
people to the cause of freedom, justice and equality in South 
Africa. 
 
   <br><br>  There was further strengthening of relations through bilateral 
cooperation with the countries of East Africa &amp; the Indian Ocean. 
The Minister of State in the Ministry of External Affairs, Shri S. 
Kundu, visited Uganda, Zambia, Malawi and Seychelles in May- 
June 1979. 
 
  <br><br>   India offered a credit of Rs. 2.5 crores in addition to credit 
for the Industrial Development Bank of India, of Rs. 5 crores to 
the new government in Uganda as a measure of assistance towards 
that country's economic reconstruction.  A consignment of medi- 
cines and rice was also gifted to meet Uganda's urgent require- 
ments.  A number of joint-ventures set up with Indian participa- 
tion in Kenya progressed satisfactorily.  The level of economic 
and technical cooperation with Zambia and Tanzania was also 
well maintained.  Agreements for avoidance of double-taxation 
were concluded with Tanzania and Zambia.  Arrangements were 
finalised for students from Tanzania to study in engineering institu- 
tions in India under the World Bank aided scheme.  The Com- 
merce Secretary visited Addis Ababa in December and held 
fruitful discussions with the Ethiopian government and identified 
areas where bilateral cooperation could be extended to mutual 
benefit.  Emergency relief assistance in the form of medical sup- 
plies was provided to the Front-Line States of Zambia and 
Mozambique following attacks on their territory by the illegal 
regime in Rhodesia.  Specific programmes of technical coopera- 
                      <br><br>pg25<br><br>
 
tion axe being worked out with Botswana, Malawi, Lesotho and 
Mozambique. 
 
  <br><br>   The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri S. Kundu, 
participated in the Liberation Day Celebrations of Seychelles. 
The INS Shakti paid a goodwill visit on this occasion.  The 
Seychelles Minister of Transport, Labour and Health and also 
the Principal Finance Secretary, Principal Works Secretary and 
Foreign Secretary visited India during the year. 
 
   <br><br>  There was further consolidation of relations with Mauritius 
through exchange of visits at the ministerial level and by 
exchanges in the cultural and educational fields.  The Prime 
Minister of Mauritius visited India twice during the year.  The 
first meeting of the Indo-Mauritius Joint Commission took place 
at New Delhi in April.  It reviewed technical and cultural co- 
operation between the two countries and identified areas of 
further cooperation.  The deputation of experts under Indian 
Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC), grant of commer- 
cial credits and assistance to Mauritius in procuring its require- 
ments from India were inter-alia agreed upon during this meeting. 
 
   <br><br>  Indian continued to have close ties with Nigeria and Ghana. 
The visit of the Nigerian Minister of Industry to India in 
May-June 1979 helped to further consolidate wide-range econo- 
mic cooperation with that country.  An agreement was finalised 
to establish a Joint Commission on Economic, Scientific and 
Technical Cooperation with Nigeria. 
 
  <br><br>   As regards, relations with Liberia a notable innovation was 
the rrangement for the training of 50 Liberian craftsmen under 
trilateral programme between Indian, Eurpoean Economic Com- 
munity and Liberia with EEC meeting the cost of international 
travel and India meeting the training expenses. 
 
   <br><br>  The opening of a resident mission in Ivory Coast in October 
1979 reflected India's desire to expand relations with Franco- 
phone.  A protocol on economic cooperation was signed with the 
Senegal during the visit of its Minister of Industry to India in 
April-May.  It provided for cooperation in a number of fields 
and helped to consolidate India's cordial relations with that 
country. 
                   <br><br>pg26<br><br>
 
     India sent consignment of wheat, rice, medicines and baby- 
food to Zaire as a measure of relief in connection with the famine 
in that country. 
 
   <br><br>  India concluded a cooperation agreement with the Economic 
Commission for Africa.  It provided for a grant of Rs. 50 lakhs 
to the United Nations Trust Fund for African Development.  This 
was the first such contribution to the Fund by a non-African deve- 
loping country.

    <br><br> India continued to have cordial relations with the countries of 
Western Europe and these were strengthened by exchanges in a 
number of fields. 
 
  <br><br>   The European Economic Community continued to be India's 
single largest trading partner.  The seventh meeting of the Indo- 
EEC Joint Commission at New Delhi, in November, resulted in 
modest progress towards cooperation through the setting up of an 
Indian Trade Centre in Brussels and some aid from the Com- 
munity for trade promotion measures.  Negotiations are under- 
way for a new cooperation agreement between the European 
Community and India to replace the Commercial Cooperation 
Agreement signed in 1973.  Modifications proposed in the new 
agreement aim at giving it a wider coverage, including the field of 
economic cooperation.  More detailed and specific provisions, 
including those relating to the role of the Joint Commission, are 
expected to be incorporated in the new agreement.  A new provi- 
sion has been proposed for exchange of information and friendly 
consultations for purposes of seeking mutually satisfactory solu- 
tions to problems. 
 <br><br>
     India's relations with the U.K. were marked by frequent ex- 
change of views on bilateral and international matters.  The 
British Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, paid an official visit 
to India in July.  He called on Prime Minister Morarji Desai, the 
Deputy Prime Ministers, Shri Charan Singh and Shri Jagjivan 
Ram, and the Minister of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee. 
His discussions with the Minister of External Affairs covered 
Rhodesia and the Disarmament problem.  India's concern that the 
people of Indian origin in U.K. should not face discrimination or 
harassment was conveyed to him.  The British Minister of State 
at the Home Officer, Mr. Tomothy Raison, visited India in 
October to familiarise himself with immigration procedures and 
problems.  He called on the Minister of State of External Affairs, 
Shri B. Barua.  During the talks, India urged that there should 
be no discrimination against Asians or Indians in British legis- 
lation on immigration. 
 
       <br><br>pg27<br><br>
                          pg28<br><br>
 
     India observed official mourning at the assassination of Lord 
Mountbatten in September 1979.  The U.K. Government and 
people were touched by the reaction of sympathy and admiration 
for him in India.  Shri M. Hidayatullah, Vice-President of India, 
led the Indian delegation to attend the funeral ceremony in 
London. 
 <br><br>
     Following elections in U.K. in May 1979, the new U.K. 
government found it necessary to curtail government expenditure 
including the overseas aid programme.  Aid to be available to 
India is now estimated to be pound 140.5 million. 
 <br><br>
     Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary, visited India 
again from Jan 16, 1980 to 18 January 1980, very soon after the constitu- 
tion of the new government after the Elections.  He met Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi and the Minister of External Affairs, 
Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao.  There were wide-ranging discussions 
on international and bilateral issues.  Lord Carrington gave his 
assessment of the reactions in the region to the events in Afghanis- 
tan in December 1979.  India's concern over the escalation of the 
tension in the region was conveyed to him.  The situation in 
Rhodesia and problems concerning the Indian community in U.K. 
were also discussed in a free and friendly atmosphere. 
 <br><br>
     India's relations with the Federal Republic of Germany con- 
tinued to be marked by a spirit of friendship and close cooperation. 
Prime Minister Morarji Desai and the Minister of External Affairs, 
Shri A. B. Vajpayee, made a transit visit to Frankfurt in June 
1979 and held discussions with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and 
Foreign Minister Genscher.  India continued to be the single 
largest recipient of West German assistance.  An Indo-FRG Aid 
Agreement for the period 1979-80, for aid amounting to Rs. 165 
crores, was signed at New Delhi in October 1979.  Some of the 
major projects covered under this are: the Thermal Power Plant 
at Singrauli, Neyveli Lignite Corporation and the Agriculture and 
Refinance Corporation.  There was also steady growth in Indo- 
FRG trade which crossed the figure of DM 2,000 million (about 
Rs. 800 crores) during the year. 
 
   <br><br>  Dr. Bruno Kreisky, Chancellor of Austria, visited India at the 
end of January 1980 to address the UNIDO Conference.  His 
talks with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi covered international 
and bilateral relations.  The visit was a significant contribution to 
Indo-Austrian friendship. 
          <br><br>pg29<br><br>
 
  <br><br>   Friendship and cooperation continued to mark relations bet- 
ween India and France.  The Minister of State of External 
Affairs, Shri B. Barua, made a transit visit to Paris in October 
1979 and met the French Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, 
Mr. Olivier Stirn.  A French delegation, led by the Director of 
Department of External Economic Relations, Mr. Freyche, visited 
India in December 1979 to identify possible areas of cooperation. 
 
   <br><br>  President Giscard d'Estaing of France paid a State visit to 
India in January 1980 and was the Guest of Honour at the Re- 
public Day festivities.  This was the first visit by a French 
President to India.  He was accompanied by the French Foreign 
Minister, Mr. J. Francois-Poncet and the French Minister of 
Foreign Trade, Mr. J. F. Deniau.  The President held talks with 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, while the two French Ministers 
met their counter-parts, besides official talks between the delega- 
tions.  A notable outcome of the talks was the Joint Declaration 
issued on 27 January 1980 by the French President and Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi. (Appendix XIII). 
 
   <br><br>  The visit was highly successful in furthering bilateral coopera- 
tion.  It resulted in the signing of seven protocols and memo- 
randa of understanding : (1) Protocol on Indo-French Industrial 
and commercial cooperation; (2) Memorandum of Understand- 
ing on Coal Mining; (3) Memorandum of Understanding on the 
Aluminium Complex in Orissa: (4) Indo-French Protocol for 
cooperation in the field of Agriculture and Rural Development; 
(5) Protocol in the field of Petrochemicals, Fertilizers, Drugs and 
Chemicals; (6) Protocol in the field of renewable energies; and 
(7) Protocol in the field of Ocean Science and Technology.  In 
addition, it was agreed that possibilities of cooperation should be 
explored in the fields of steel industry, telecommunications and 
audio-visual techniques. 
 
  <br><br>   In the Joint Communique issued on 28 January 1980, both 
sides agreed to consider the setting up of an Indo-French Univer- 
sity or an Institute of Higher Learning in India.  The President 
and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi agreed to hold periodic consul- 
tations alternately in France and in India to suit mutual conveni- 
ence. 
 
The major allocation for 1979, from French assistance to India 
of Rs. 68 crores (Francs 300 million) annually, was for the im- 
port of drilling rig by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission. 
                  <br><br>pg30<br><br>
     A French delegation visited India in November and a pro- 
gramme for 1980-82 was finalised under the Indo-French 
Cultural Agreement.  An Agreement for Cooperation in Science 
and Technology was also ratified during the year. 
 
 <br><br>    A formal agreement for aid from the Netherlands was con- 
cluded during the year.  It provided for a grant of Dfl. 61 million 
and a loan of Dfl. 164 million for a period of 30 years carrying 
an interest of 2.5% per annum. 
 
<br><br>     India continued to receive useful assistance from the countries 
of the Nordic region.  Sweden extended aid to the extent of S. Kr. 
290 million entirely as a grant for 1979-80.  Of this amount S. Kr. 
165 million would be completely untied and to be used for financ- 
ing; imports from any part of the world.  Discussions held in 
October with Norway indicated that during the next four year 
(1980-83) technical assistance amounting to Kr. 106 million 
per year would be extended to India. 
 
   <br><br>  The Indian Ambassador in Norway held reception in honour 
of Mother Teresa when she went to Oslo to receive the Nobel 
Peace Prize. 
 
   <br><br>  The grant from Denmark of D. Kr. 85 million in 1979 was 
utilised for projects in agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries etc. 
The services of the Danish Agency DANIDA were utilised in 
several projects. 
 
    <br><br> The Finnish Deputy Secretary-General, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Dr. Korhonen, held discussions with Indian officials, when 
he visited India in November, in connection with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Conference. 
 
   <br><br>  India welcomed the talks, in May 1979, between leaders of 
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.  India has con- 
sistently reiterated that a solution to the Cyprus problem could 
be arrived at through negotiations between the two affected parties 
without outside interference.  India has supported the U.N. Reso- 
lutions on the subject calling for respect for the sovereignty, inde- 
pendence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic 
of Cyprus.

                    The USSR and Eastern Europe <br><br>
 
     India's relations with the USSR and other East European 
countries were further strengthened and diversified by an ex- 
change of visits at the highest level and through the working of 
the Joint Commissions set up with those countries. 
 
   <br><br>  The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.. 
Mr. A. N. Kosygin, visited India from 9 to 18 March 1979.  Dis- 
cussions held during the visit showed that India and the U.S.S.R. 
shared similar views on major international problems.  The joint 
communique issued at the end of this visit re-affirmed that the 
strengthening of Indo-Soviet relations, on the principles of peace- 
ful co-existence, was an immutable factor in the foreign policy of 
both countries.  The USSR expressed appreciation of Indian 
initiatives to normalise relations with the countries of South Asia. 
 
    <br><br> A number of agreements and protocols were signed during the 
visit including an Agreement on cooperation in Medical Sciences 
and Public Health, a protocol on the supply of agriculture 
machines and motor vehicles as a gift from the USSR to the Surat- 
garh State Farm, a Cultural Exchange Programme for 1979 and 
1980 and an agreement on additional reciprocal deliveries of 
some commodities in 1979. 
 
  <br><br>   The most significant document to emerge was a Long Term 
Programme of Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technical Coope- 
ration between the two countries for the next ten to fifteen years. 
This Programme, the first of its kind entered into by India, will 
provide a framework for future bilateral cooperation in a wide 
range of activities.  In the framework of this Programme teams of 
experts from India in the fields of inland fisheries, pulp and paper 
and the food industry visited the USSR and teams of experts from 
the USSR in the fields of coal mining, machine building and 
ferrous metallurgy visited India.  Some other important projects, 
in which the USSR has agreed to cooperate with India, are an 
alumina plant on the east coast of India, the expansion and 
organisation of some specified coal-fields, and cooperation in the 
field of irrigation. 
   <br><br>  The Minister of Petroleum and Chemicals, Shri H. N. 
Bahuguna, visited the USSR from 28 May to 2 June 1979.  He 
had detailed discussions on future cooperation in oil-exploration 
and production.  A protocol was signed on the extent and manner 
                    <br><br>pg32<br><br>
 
of such cooperation, especially in the regions of West Bengal, 
Tripura and Kaveri delta. 
 
   <br><br>  Prime Minister Morarji Desai, accompanied by Shri A. B. 
Vajpayee, Minister of External Affairs, visited the USSR from 10 
to 14 June.  A joint statement, issued on the conclusion of the 
visit reiterated the resolve of India and the USSR to further 
strengthen their close cooperation which not only served the inte- 
rests of their two countries but also the cause of world peace and 
international cooperation. 
 
   <br><br>  An agreement for the setting up of a steel plant with Soviet 
collaboration at Visakhapatnam was also signed during the session 
of the Indo-Soviet Joint Commission held at Moscow in June. 
The Commission also decided to set up a group which would 
monitor the progress made in regard to the programme of coope- 
ration, agreed to during the visit of Mr. A. N. Kosygin, and make 
suggestions for facilitating its implementation. 
 
   <br><br>  In the same month the Speaker of the Lok Sabha Shri K. S. 
Hegde led a Parliamentary delegation to the USSR. 
 
   <br><br>  Mr. P. Y. Strautmanis, Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of the USSR, led a Friendship delegation of the Soviet-Indo- 
Friendship Society to India in August.  During his discussions he 
was assured that India would continue to promote Indo-USSR 
Friendship in the same spirit of trust and cooperation which 
characterised the traditionally close and friendly relations between 
the two countries. 
 
    <br><br> Mr. A. N. Kosygin made a transit halt at Bombay in Septem- 
ber.  The Minister of External Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra, received 
the distinguished guest and had discussions with him on subjects 
of mutual interest. 
 
    <br><br> Prime Minister Morarji Desai visited Poland from 14 to 16 
June.  This visit helped to consolidate India's close relations with 
Poland.  There was a broad agreement of views on important 
international issues during the discussions held with Polish leaders. 
It was agreed that the existing economic and commercial coopera- 
tion should be strengthened still further to reflect the strong 
political ties between the two countries, by exploring new 
avenues of cooperation for mutual benefit. 
                      <br><br>pg33<br><br>
 
     From 16 to 18 June, Prime Minister Morarji Desai visited 
Czechoslovakia.  India's friendly relations with Czechoslovakia 
were strengthened by his visit.  A common ground on various 
international issues was revealed during the talks held between the 
Prime Minister and Czechoslovakian leaders.  To consolidate 
existing economic and commercial ties, it was proposed that new 
channels of cooperation should be taken up for mutual benefit, so 
that the close political tics between India and Czechoslovakia 
could be further augmented. 
 
   <br><br>  Shri K. S. Hegde, Speaker of the Lok Sabha, led a Parliamen- 
tary delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania in June. 
During his visit a review was made of the existing cooperation 
between the parliaments of these countries and the Indian Parlia- 
ment. 
 
    <br><br> The sixth session of the Indo-Polish Joint Commission for 
Economic, Technical and Scientific cooperation, held at New 
Delhi in March 1979, identified several important projects for 
Indo-Polish cooperation.  Those projects included cooperation in 
the sinking of two shafts in the Jharia coal-fields, the modernisa- 
tion of communication equipment in Indian coalfields and the 
enrichment and smelting of poly-metallic ores. 
 
   <br><br>  During his private visit to India from 14 to 18 March, Mr. 
Vasil Bilak, Member of the Politbureau and Secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, 
called on the President, Shri N. Sanjiva Reddy, Prime Minister 
Morarji Desai and the Minister of External Affairs.  Shri A. B. 
Vajpayee and conveyed the satisfaction of the Czech govern- 
ment at the steady progress of India-Czech relations.  He also 
gave an assessment of the political situation in Central Europe. 
 
   <br><br>  The eighth session of the Indo-Czechoslovak Joint Commis- 
sion for Economic, Trade and Technical Cooperation was held at 
Prague in June 1979.  The protocol signed at the conclusion of 
the session identified many projects for bilateral cooperation.  A 
new trade and payments agreements with Czechoslovakia for 
1980-84 was signed at New Delhi, in December 1979. 
The Federal Secretary of the Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, Mr. J. Vrohovec, visited India from 5 to 7 May for 
consultations prior to the meeting of the Coordination Bureau of 
Non-aligned countries to be held at Colombo in June.  During 
 
4-784EA/79 
                         <br><br>pg34<br><br>
 
his discussions, with the Minister  of External Affairs, Shri A. B. 
Vajpayee, it was agreed that all efforts should be made to preserve 
and strengthen the unity of the Non-Aligned Movement, and 
regional issues should not distract the Bureau meeting from 
attending to current global problems. 
 
  <br><br>   Prime Minister Morarji Desai, accompanied by the Minister 
of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, paid an official visit to 
Yugoslavia from 18 to 21 June.  He also held talks with Presi- 
dent Tito and the President of the Federal Executive Council, Mr. 
V. Djuranovic.  These talks were held in a friendly atmosphere 
in keeping with the traditionally cordial and close relations bet- 
ween the two countries.  The Indian Prime Minister and the 
Yugoslav Prime Minister called on the members of the Non- 
Aligned Movement to maintain the unity of the Movement by 
resisting divisive pressures from within and without. 
 
  <br><br>   The twelfth session of the Indo-Yugoslav Joint Commission 
for Economic Trade and Technical and Scientific Cooperation was 
held at Belgrade in June.  Its discussions covered bilateral rela- 
tions concerning trade, industrial cooperation, banking, finance, 
shipping, air-transport and tripartite agreements.  It was agreed 
that efforts should be made to develop trade turn-over between 
Yugoslavia and India by 1983, compared to the level of 1977, 
through long-term arrangements. 
 
   <br><br>  The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, Mr. T. 
Popov, visited India in March.  He had discussions with officials 
of the Ministry of External Affairs, during which he conveyed the 
satisfaction of the Bulgarian government at the progress of Indo- 
Bulgarian relations in various fields. 
 
   <br><br>  Mr. D. Stanischev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Bulgarian Communist Party, paid a private visit to India in April. 
He had the occasion to discuss bilateral relations with officials of 
the Ministry of External Affairs. 
 
   <br><br>  Shri Jagjivan Ram, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Defence, visited Bulgaria and Romania in June 1979.  Bilateral

<br><br>North America 
 
   <br><br>  India and the United States continued to maintain a dialogue 
at various levels, through exchange of visits and correspondence, 
each trying to make the other understand its point of view on 
various international issues.  Letters were exchanged between 
President Carter and Prime Minister Morarji Desai and between 
him and Prime Minister Charan Singh.  A delegation from the 
United States led by Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Warren 
Christopher, held official-level talks with Indian officials from 28 
February to Mar 01, 1979 at New Delhi.  There was a useful 
exchange of views not only on bilateral relations but also on 
various international developments.  Mr. Christopher met Prime 
Minister Morarji Desai during his visit. 
 
   <br><br>  The Minister of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee visited 
the United States from 20 to 25 April 1979.  He met President 
Carter and had talks with various U.S. officials. The  former 
Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shri K. S. Hegde, and various presid- 
ing officers of State Assemblies, also visited the United  States. 
Other Indian visitors to that country included Shri B. P. Singh, 
Minister for Rural Reconstruction.  From the side of the United 
States, apart from various officials, Senator Charles Percy came 
to India in August and met Prime Minister Charan Singh during 
his visit. 
 
   <br><br>  There were, however, differences between the two countries 
on certain issues particularly with regard to the supply of nuclear 
fuel for Tarapur Plant.  Presently two applications for 19.8 tons 
each are pending with the United States.  India made it clear to 
the United States on a number of occasions, that it should honour 
its contractual obligations on this matter and the issue is being 
considered at the highest level.  The problem could affect bila- 
teral relations. 
 
   <br><br>  The Minister of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee led the 
Indian delegation to the fourth session of the Indo-US Joint 
Commission held in Washington in April.  The Commission 
 
                    <br><br>pg35<br><br>
                     pg36<br><br>
 
gave high priority to collaborative efforts in the agricultural field 
and decided to set up a Fourth Sub-Commission--the Agriculture 
Sub-Commission--for this purpose.  The Commission received 
and approved the reports of the other three Sub-Commissions. 
It accepted the plans of the Education and Cultural Sub-Commis- 
sion to increase the number of fellowships and discussed the 
future exchange programmes.  It noted with satisfaction the new 
areas of collaboration proposed by the Scientific and Technology 
Sub-Commission, particularly in the field of solar energy.  It 
also reviewed the activities of the Indo-US Business Council and 
endorsed the Council's project of Indo-US commercial coopera- 
tion in third countries. 
 
   <br><br>  A factor that could adversely affect relations between India 
and the United States was the decision by the United States to 
supply arms to Pakistan, as a result of the events in Afghanistan, 
The United States had earlier banned credit and grant sales of 
arms to Pakistan as a result of U.S. legislation which debarred 
arms supply to any country undertaking the building of nuclear 
facilities.  The United States would have to pass emergency 
legislation to get over legal difficulties in order to renew supply 
of arms to Pakistan.  India expressed its deepest concern to the 
United States on this decision as, in its view, this would need- 
lessly complicate the situation and further aggravate tension in 
the area. 
 
 <br><br>    India and Canada, after many years, resumed official talks 
and a meeting was held on 19-20 March at New Delhi.  The 
meeting undertook a broad exchange of views on Indo-Canadian 
relations and also reviewed the international situation.  It was 
agreed that such meetings should be held annually as this would 
facilitate discussions in the political, economic and cultural fields. 
 
  <br><br>   An agreement was signed in August, providing for a Cana- 
dian grant amounting to Canadian $ 20 million, to enable India 
to import rapeseed oil.  A FICCI delegation visited Canada in 
June 1979. 
 
<br><br>South and Central America 
   <br><br>  India continued to maintain friendly relations with the coun- 
tries of Central and South America.  It welcomed the achieve- 
ment of independence by the Caribbean islands of St. Lucia, 
Saint Vincent and Grenadines and the admission of Bolivia, 
                             <br><br>pg37<br><br>
 
Grenada, Suriname and Nicaragua, as full-fledged members, to 
the Non-Aligned Movement at the Havana Summit Conference. 
 
    <br><br> In Nicaragua a successful revolution by the people resulted 
in the establishment of National Government of Reconstruction. 
India conveyed its greetings to the government and extended 
an offer of assistance in its programme of reconstruction. 
 
   <br><br>  India had consistently supported the people of Panama in 
their aspirations regarding the Panama Canal.  It welcomed the 
handing-over, by the United States, of the control of the Canal 
to Panama in October 1979. 
 <br><br>
     India and Cuba had frequent consultations on various aspects 
of the Non-Aligned Movement, particularly in connection with 
the preparatory work for the Non-Aligned Summit Conference 
at Havana.  Dr. Zoilo Marinello Vidaurreta, Minister President 
of the State Committee and Special envoy of President Castro, 
visited India in April to hand-over the invitation to Prime Minis- 
ter Morarji Desai for the Summit Conference to be held  at 
Havana.  Dr. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, Vice-President of the 
Council of State of Cuba, visited India in July to discuss the 
draft declaration of the Havana Summit.  During his visit, 
opportunity was taken to review relations between the two coun- 
fries and to consider measures to further improve them. 
 <br><br>
     The Minister of External Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra, as a 
token of sympathy towards the hurricane-affected people of the 
Commonwealth of Dominica, announced a donation to be utilised 
in sending relief supplies in the form of medicines and drugs. 
 
   <br><br>  Indian missions in the region made considerable efforts to- 
wards improving bilateral, economic relations with the countries 
there.  This led to a growing awareness about India's industrial 
Mid technological progress and capability and a number of 
countries showed interest in having joint ventures in some 
selected items. 
 
   <br><br>  Steps were taken to explore possibilities of developing coope- 
ration with Latin American countries, particularly Venezuela. 
Mexico and Cuba.  With a view to exploring the potential for 
greater economic and technical cooperation between India and 
the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, a meeting, 
with cooperation and participation of the Economic Commission 
                        <br><br>pg38<br><br>
 
for Latin America, was held in June at New Delhi.  The repre- 
sentatives of India and those of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colom- 
bia, Cuba, Guyana, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Trinidad 
and Tobago, Suriname and Venezuela and the officials of Eco- 
nomic Commission for Latin America participated in the meet- 
ing.  The meeting discussed trade promotion measures and ways 
and means of covering the information gap, joint marketing of 
commodities, shipping, possibilities of participation in industrial 
and other developmental programmes and joint participation in 
third countries, collaboration in consultancy, aspects of transfer 
of technology, establishment of links amongst research and train- 
ing institutions. 
 
   <br><br>  As a follow-up action the Association of Indian Engineering 
Industries (AIEI) is sending a delegation to some Latin American 
countries to identify possibilities of cooperation in the field of 
joint ventures, consultancy services, cooperation in third coun- 
tries etc.

                  <br><br> UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL 
                         <br><br>    CONFERENCES 
 
<br><br>     During the year India participated in a number of important 
conferences.  These included, a meeting of the Coordinating 
Bureau of the Non-aligned countries at Colombo from 4 to 9 
June, Sixth Conference of Heads of State/Government of Non- 
aligned countries at Havana from 3 to 8 September and the 
Second General Conference of the Non-aligned Press Agencies' 
Pool at Belgrade in November 1979.  It also took part in the 
Conferences sponsored by the United Nations, namely, meetings 
of Littoral and Hinterland countries of the Indian Ocean in July, 
United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Deve- 
lopment at Vienna in August and General Conference of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at New Delhi in 
December 1979.  Besides, it took part in the meeting of the 
Heads of Government of the Commonwealth held at Lusaka in 
August 1979. 
 
   <br><br>  The Minister of External Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra, led the 
Indian delegation to the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of 
Government, held at Lusaka in August 1979.  The agenda for 
the Conference included the world political scene, international 
economic development and Commonwealth cooperation.  Rho- 
desia was the most important issue discussed at the Conference. 
The participants through mutual discussions produced a frame- 
work for the Rhodesian settlement based on genuine majority 
rule.  India, while welcoming the proposal for the settlement, 
drew attention to the crucial importance of ensuring proper 
conditions for the participation of the Patriotic Front and the 
need to continuing sanctions against Rhodesia until the proposals 
as a whole were implemented fully and speedily. 
 
  <br><br>   On the economic side, the Conference highlighted the urgent 
need for a more rational and equitable economic order.  It called 
for the acceptance by all of a structural change and the adoption 
of policies to improve prospects for global economic growth, res- 
traint of inflation and a fuller employment of resources.  Higher 
rates of growth were accepted as being particularly urgent for 
the developing countries.  The Conference also discussed energy 
 
                        <br><br>pg39<br><br>
                         pg40<br><br>
 
problems and multilateral trade negotiations and in this connec- 
tion a mention was made of the meeting of Commonwealth 
Ministers of Industrial Cooperation held at Bangalore in March 
1979.  It was also decided that an Industrial Development Unit 
should be established under the Commonwealth Secretariat with 
a proposed additional financial resources of $ 5 million for a 
three-year period.  India took the lead in the preparatory work 
for this programme. 
 
    <br><br> The Minister of External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, led 
the Indian delegation to the meeting of the Non-aligned Coordi- 
nating Bureau held at Colombo from Jun 04, 1979 to 9 June 1979.  The 
meeting took place at a time and in circumstances crucial to the 
unity of the Non-aligned Movement.  The representation of 
Kampuchea and the issue of participation of Egypt were the 
dominant political issues at the Conference.  A third dimension 
was added by the growing desire among non-members of the 
Bureau for participation in the decision-making processes of 
Bureau meetings.  As a result, in addition to 23 Bureau mem- 
bers present, the meeting was also attended by 52 members of 
the Movement, 9 observers/guests and 12 international/regional 
organisations. 
 
    <br><br> India played a leading and constructive role at the Confer- 
ence.  The Indian delegation was guided by consideration of 
preserving the unity and cohesion of the movement.  On the 
highly controversial questions of Kampuchea's representation and 
Egypt's participation the Indian delegation worked for evolving 
compromise solutions so that the movement was not distracted 
from attending to other vital issues. 
 
<br><br>The Sixth Non-aligned Summit meeting was held at Havana 
from 3 to 9 September 1979. It was the  first time that such a 
meeting was held in a Latin American country.  The meeting 
was attended by 54 Heads of State/Government including the 
Heads of some National Liberation Movements.  The member- 
ship of the Movement had grown to 94, with 20 countries and 
organisations as observers and 18 countries and organisations as 
guests.  This reflected a growing desire on the part of nations 
to join the Non-aligned family. 
 <br><br>
     The Indian delectation was led by the Minister of External 
Affairs Shri S. N. Mishra.  India was elected as one of the Vice- 
Presidents of the Conference and re-elected to the expanded 
Coordinating Bureau of 36 members.  The choice of India, by 
       <br><br>pg41<br><br>
 
general consensus, was in recognition of the positive role India 
had continued to play in the work of the Coordinating Bureau 
of the Non-aligned Movement. 
 
 <br><br>    The Conference met in an atmosphere of underlying tension. 
There were not only deeply divisive issues, like the question of 
Kampuchea, the Egypt-Israeli Treaty and the question of Wes- 
tern Sahara, but also the uncertainty, if not anxiety, about the 
preservation of the fundamental objectives and goals of the Non- 
aligned Movement and its future role and direction.  The 
debate on contentious issues was protracted and often acrimo- 
nious. However, in the end it was possible to arrive  at a con- 
sensus regarding Kampuchea.  The consensus adopted coin- 
cided with India's position, namely, that the seat of Kampuchea 
should be kept vacant since it was not possible for the Non- 
aligned community, at the present stage, to take a decision in 
favour of one or the other delegation.  On the West Asian situa- 
tion, the Summit was highly critical of the Egypt-Israeli treaties 
and adopted a strong resolution expressing its disapproval and 
condemnation of the treaties.  As regards the demand to sus- 
pend Egypt from the Movement, there was no consensus and a 
compromise was reached to refer the question to the Coordinat- 
ing Bureau for further examination and eventual reporting to the 
Ministerial Conference in 1981.  There was unanimity about 
the continuing relevance of non-alignment  as a positive, indepen- 
dent and important factor in the world for peace and stability 
and promotion of international cooperation and understanding. 
 
  <br><br>   India reiterated its conviction that Non-aligned Conferences 
should avoid divisive issues and bilateral disputes and instead 
concentrate on the broad objectives which  brought the Non- 
aligned countries together.  They should concentrate and pay 
undividing attention on working out a joint strategy for achiev- 
ing these objectives.  It was necessary for this to preserve and 
strengthen the unity of the Movement and to further vitalise its 
operational effectiveness. 
 
  <br><br>   The Final Declaration adopted by the meeting consisted of a 
political as well as an economic  section, and the Action Pro- 
gramme. These, in their totality,  constituted a significant policy 
frame-work and provided useful guidelines for future action. 
There was reiteration of the call for renewed and  intensified 
efforts to achieve the New International Economic Order.  A 
fresh round of global negotiations was proposed to find solutions 
to the urgent economic problems of the developing Countries. 
            <br><br>pg42<br><br>
 
The Summit also underlined the importance of drawing up an 
international development strategy for the Third United Nations 
Development Decade (the eighties).  On crucial questions of 
raw-materials and energy, India was able, with the help and co- 
operation of the OPEC countries, to evolve a resolution setting 
out guidelines of cooperation among the Non-aligned countries 
for strengthening their collective self-reliance. 
 <br><br>
     An important decision taken by the Summit related to the 
activities of the Non-aligned Press Agencies Pool and other 
non-aligned activities in the field of information.  The Summit 
commended the Pool's performance and called upon members 
to strengthen their participation in the Pool. 
 
  <br><br>   A meeting of the countries of the Indian Ocean region was 
held at New York from 2 to 13 July, to review developments 
since the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a "Zone of 
Peace" and pave the way for the convening of a conference on 
implementation of the Declaration.  Apart from 44 littoral and 
hinterland states, four countries (China, Greece, Japan and 
Panama), that were members or observers of the Ad hoc Com- 
mittee, and 11 countries representing great powers and major 
maritime users (Canada, France, FRG, Italy, Liberia, Nether- 
lands, Norway, Sweden, USSR, U.K. and U.S.A.) were also 
invited to attend the Conference.  In addition, Yugoslavia, Viet- 
nam and Finland were invited to participate as observers.  The 
meeting adopted a final document, by consensus, relating to the 
future conference on the Indian Ocean as a "Zone of Peace" 
denuclearisation of the Zone and the strengthening of internal 
security through regional and other cooperation.  Australia, 
however, declared that it was withdrawing from the consensus 
and Japan also expressed unhappiness about certain formula- 
tions in the document. 
 
  <br><br>   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development held its 
fifth session at Manila from 7 May to 3 June.  It was attended 
by representatives of nearly 170 nations. 
 
  <br><br>   Shri M. Dharia, Minister of Commerce, led the Indian 
delegation.  Addressing the Conference he said that the growth 
rate in world  trade had decelerated, the terms of trade of develop- 
ing countries  had deteriorated and there was a simultaneous in- 
tensification of protectionist measures affecting the export of 
their manufactures.  There was also a tremendous increase in 
the debt burden of developing countries.  These problems de- 
manded a basic restructuring of the world economy.  Referring 
                <br><br>pg43<br><br>
 
to the multilateral trade negotiations India expressed concern at 
sonic of the obvious and glaring shortfalls particularly in the 
field of safeguards, quantitative restrictions and the nature and 
extent of tariff offers.  Expressing serious concern at the pro- 
tectionist measures adopted by the developed countries, India 
wanted the Conference to establish a framework within UNCTAD 
in which negotiations might be conducted on the policies that 
needed to be adopted from time to time to facilitate adjustments 
before the forces of protectionism gathered further momentum. 
 
    <br><br> India made a contribution of $5 million (Rs. 4 crores) to 
the Second Window of the Common Fund for commodity deve- 
lopment purposes.  The Second Window would finance measures 
other than buffer stocking of commodities which would be taken 
care of by the First Window.  The target for the Second Window 
was $350 million. 
 
   <br><br>  The Conference ended with un-reconciled North-South diffe- 
rences on hard-core issues like global economic restructuring, 
protectionism, trade, monetary reform and resource flows.  It, 
however, took a few steps forward.  A programme of economic 
cooperation among developing countries aimed at collective self- 
reliance was adopted.  Another resolution on an integrated pro- 
gramme for commodities gave not only a thrust to completion of 
Common Fund formalities and individual commodity negotiations, 
but provided a framework of international cooperation in the 
field of processing, marketing and distribution of commodities. 
 
  <br><br>   The Group of 77, with India as its Coordinator on trade issues, 
expressed deep disappointment with the consensus formulation on 
protectionism and over the failure to get an agreed resolution on 
multilateral trade negotiations to remove deficiencies and make 
them reflect the concerns of developing countries.  On the 
major question regarding structural changes in the world  economy 
through global consultations, lack of agreement led to  the issue 
being remitted to the permanent machinery of UNCTAD--the 
Trade and Development Board. 
 
  <br><br>   The plenary session of the Conference adopted comprehensive 
resolutions, all by consensus, on the programme of action for the 
least developed countries, land-locked and island developing coun- 
tries and on strengthning their technological capability and on 
transfer of their real resources.  Developed countries, especially the 
United States, expressed reservations on most of the resolutions.  On 
the code of conduct for transfer of technology, the Conference 
                     <br><br>pg44<br><br>
 
could not reach agreement on whether it should be legally binding 
or be a voluntary code.  On development aid generally, the 
Conference urged substantial increases  towards  the  United 
Nations target of 0.7% of gross; national Income in official deve- 
lopmental aid for the current decade. 
 
     <br><br>The United Nations Conference on Science and Technology 
for Development (UNCSTD) was held at Vienna from 20 to 31 
August.  It was attended by representatives of about 130 coun- 
tries and opened by the U.N. Secretary-General.  The leader 
of the Indian delegation, Prof.  D. T. Lakdawala, Vice-Chairman 
of the Planning Commission, addressing the Conference called 
for complete change in the whole spirit which presently pervaded 
science and technology and its transmission.  In regard to inter- 
national cooperation he advocated for a sharp break from the 
existing pattern of scientific and technological cooperation bet- 
ween the developing and developed countries which tended to; 
increase dependence of the developing world and accentuate dis- 
parities in scientific and technological capabilities. 
 
   <br><br>  The Conference could not reach agreement on recommenda- 
tions concerning the role of transnational corporations in science 
and technology, supplementary financing and substantially in- 
creased support to developing countries for the production and 
marketing of capital goods.  An agreement was, however, reach- 
ed on institutional and funding arrangements on which the deve- 
loping countries and others had earlier held divergent positions. 
It asked the General Assembly to set up a high level non-govern- 
mental committee on science and technology for development 
which would be open to all the States.  The Conference approved 
of a programme of action making 65 recommendations directed 
at three target areas.  The first dealt with strengthening the 
science and technology capacities of developing countries;  the 
second involved the restructuring of the existing pattern of inter- 
national relations in the field of science and technology and the 
third sought strengthening of the role of the United Nations in 
science and technology and the provision for increased financial 
resources. 
 
  <br><br>   The Preparatory Committee for the new International Develop- 
ment Strategy, set up during the thirty-third session of the U.N. 
General Assembly, had three substantive sessions from 2 to 13 
April, 11 to 23 June and from 17 to 21 September.  After 
prolonged discussions, the Committee agreed on a draft preamble. 
The next task facing the Committee would be to indentify the 
                  <br><br>pg45<br><br>
 
goals and objectives of the strategy for the Third U.N. Develop- 
ment Decade.  The purpose of the strategy is to define targets, 
both quantified and conceptual, of economic growth for  the 
eighties and then to outline a set of policy measures and princi- 
ples that would guide and inspire international economic negotia- 
tions in specified fields to attain these targets.  India intends 
to continue to play a leading role in the preparation for such an 
international development strategy. 
 
    <br><br> India was host to the third General Conference of the United 
Nations Industrial Development Organisation held at New Delhi 
from 21 January to 9 February 1980.  The Minister of Exter- 
nal Affairs, Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, was unanimously elected 
as the Chairman of the Conference.  Despite his best efforts, 
the Conference failed to reach a consensus on a document that 
would be acceptable to all sides.  The New Delhi Declaration 
and Plan of Action, based mainly on the documents that had 
been elaborated by the Group of 77 at their Ministerial meeting 
at Havana in December 1979 and later on in the preparatory 
stage of the Conference at New Delhi, was, therefore, adopted by 
vote with developed countries voting against it.  The socialist 
countries of Eastern Europe, though voting in favour submitted 
detailed explanations and reservations in writing which would 
form part of the Report.  The results of UNIDO-III thus cons- 
titute yet another set-back in attempts to bring about significant 
changes in the international economic relations such as would 
constitute an advance in the establishment of the New Inter- 
national Economic Order.  These results do not augur well for 
the development Decade of the eighties.

organised by government/non-government organisations in which 
India participated and of which India became a member are at 
Appendices I to IV. 
 
  <br><br>   The United Nations General Assembly held its thirty-fourth 
regular session in New York from 18 September to 20 Decem- 
ber 1979.  Mr. Salim A. Salim of Tanzania was elected Presi- 
dent of the General Assembly for this session.  Later it resumed 
its sitting to elect a member from the Latin American States (Mexi- 
co was elected) to fill a non-permanent seat in the Security Coun- 
cil. 
 
   <br><br>  The Indian delegation to the session was led by the Minister 
of External Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra.  The Assembly  had 
             <br><br>pg46<br><br>
 
before it an agenda of 125 items covering disarmament, political, 
economic, social, human rights, legal and other related issues. 
Later, four new items were included, one of which, the expan- 
sion of the membership of the Security Council, being at the 
initiative of India.  The membership of the UN increased during 
the session to 152 by the inclusion of St. Lucia as its new member. 
India played an active and constructive role in the deliberations 
of the General Assembly and its committees.  The Assembly 
adopted a large number of resolutions, most of which were passed 
without vote or by consensus.  India took major initiatives in 
tabling or co-sponsoring a number of resolutions in various com- 
mittees. 
 
 <br><br>    During the Session India was re-elected as member of the 
U.N. Commission on International Trade Law for a further period 
of six years, with effect from 1 January 1980.  Shri S. Sen, an 
Indian nominee, was also appointed to the UN Administrative 
Tribunal.  Earlier in the year, in elections held in ECOSOC, 
India had been elected to the Statistical Commission, the Com- 
mission on.  Human Rights, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the 
Committee on Crime Prevention and Control and the International 
Narcotics Board.  Early in January 1980, an Indian candidate 
was also elected, securing the highest number of votes, to the 
Committee for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination. 
 
   <br><br>  The Minister of External Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra, speak- 
ing in Hindi in the general debate on 3 October, said that the 
United Nations symbolised unmistakably the best balance bet- 
ween the right to independence and the compulsion to work to- 
gether.  Surveying the world situation, he added that,  "the 
most urgent task facing humanity today is to delegitimise nuclear 
weapons, to dismantle the hierarchical international order that 
supports the present military system and to replace it by an 
alternative security system based on peaceful co-existence and ac- 
ceptance in practice of equal sovereignty of all nations and of 
the right of each nation to choose its national and international 
policies." 
 
   <br><br>  In October 1979, the five Western countries, (U.K., U.S.A., 
France, FRG and Canada) which were negotiating a peaceful 
settlement on Namibia, presented a redesigned plan for the peace- 
keeping force and UN-supervised elections for the territory.  The 
plan proposed the establishment of a 50-kilometer wide demili- 
tarised zone on either side of Namibia's northern borders along- 
side Angola and Zambia.  The Security Council met in Novem- 
                          <br><br>pg47<br><br>
 
ber to discuss the issue of Namibia.  After informal consultations, 
its President issued a statement expressing support for the 
efforts of the Secretary-General to implement Security Council 
resolution 435 of 1978, on Namibia.  While the Front-Line 
States and SWAPO accepted the concept of the demilitarised 
zone, South Africa only agreed to its conditional acceptance. 
 
<br><br>     The General Assembly, after prolonged discussions of the 
Namibian issue at its thirty-fourth session, adopted seven resolu- 
tions, all of them being co-sponsored by India.  One of the re- 
solutions sought action by the Security Council to ensure imme- 
diate compliance by South Africa with the UN resolutions  on 
Namibia.  The Council was also asked to act against any "man- 
oeuvres and fraudulent schemes" of the illegal occupation regime 
aimed at frustrating the aspirations of the Namibian people to 
realise genuine independence under the leadership of SWAPO. 
The Assembly called for an immediate halt to the exploitation of 
Namibian human and natural resources by foreign corporations 
operating in the territory. 
 
 <br><br>    The U. K. Government informed the Security Council, on 12 
December, that legality had returned to Southern Rhodesia with 
the arrival of the British Governor in Salisbury and an agree- 
ment had been reached at London, among the interested parties 
on a cease-fire, a new Constitution and fresh and fair elections in 
southern Rhodesia to elect a government for independent Zim- 
babwe.  The Security Council adopted a resolution on 21 Decem- 
ber, terminating the mandatory sanctions imposed fourteen years 
ago against Rhodesia.  The resolution noted with satisfaction 
the agreement reached and directed the United Kingdom, as the 
main administering power, to ensure that no South African or 
other external forces, regular or mercenary, remained in Rhodesia. 
It urged assistance to the new State of Zimbabwe and the Front- 
Line States which suffered extensive damage inflicted by  the 
armed forces of the minority regime in Salisbury.  The question 
of the Middle-East was taken up by the plenary session of the 
General Assembly in view of the strong reservations expressed by 
a large number of member States against the Camp David Agree- 
ments and the Egypt-Israeli treaty.  India, along with other 
members of the Non-aligned Group, took a prominent part in 
the debate.  The Non-aligned draft resolution finally adopted 
(102 votes in favour, 17 against and 20 abstentions) was co- 
sponsored by India, Cuba, Sri Lanka, Guniea (Bissau), Sudan, 
Vietnam and Yugoslavia.  It called for the early convening of 
       <br><br>pg48<br><br>
 
the peace conference on the Middle-East under the co-chairmanship 
of the USSR and one United States and with the participation of 
PLO.  It thereby, implicitly rejected the Camp David approach 
to the solution of the problem.  The Assembly also discussed the 
controversial issue of Palestine.  India played a prominent role 
in giving final shape to, and co-sponsored, the four resolutions 
adopted by the Assembly on this issue. 
 
   <br><br>  The plenary of the General Assembly adopted a series of re- 
solutions on the question of Apartheid.  Most of these were 
co-sponsored by India.  In these resolutions, the Assembly called 
for the imposition of a broad range of sanctions against South 
Africa, including oil emargo, and decided 10 organise an  in- 
ternational conference in 1980 on sanctions against that country. 
The Assembly also sought to strengthen the existing arms embargo 
and asked the Security Council to consider mandatory measures 
"to prevent the racist regime of South Africa from detonating, 
developing or acquiring nuclear weapons." 
 
   <br><br>  The Sixth Summit meeting of Non-aligned countries held at 
Havana had welcomed the holding of the meeting of the littoral 
and hinterland States as a significant step forward in the process of 
implementing the Indian Ocean Peace Zone Declaration.  Subse- 
quently, the Ad hoe Committee on Indian Ocean met in October 
and adopted the report containing the final document of the meet- 
ing including its recommendations.  The Committee decided to re- 
commend that the General Assembly convene a conference at 
Colombo during 1981 for the implementation of the Declaration 
of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.  It also unanimously 
recommended to the General Assembly the adoption of two draft 
resolutions, one of which was on an Indian initiative, devoted 
basically to the convening of a conference on the Indian Ocean 
and the participation of great powers in the expanded Ad hoc 
Committee.  The Ad hoc Committee is to hold its first session 
as the preparatory committee for the conference in late January 
1980.  It is expected that all permanent members of the Secu- 
rity Council would accept the invitation to join the Committee 
during this session. 
 
  <br><br>   The new agenda item on Kampuchea was inscribed at the 
request of the ASEAN countries.  There was a major debate and 
considerable controversy on this question as the item had to be 
considered along with the question of representation of Kampu- 
chea.  The Credentials Committee of the General Assembly un- 
             <br><br>pg49<br><br>
 
fortunately adopted the credentials of the delegation of Demo- 
cratic Kampuchea (Pol Pot regime).  India opposed the creden- 
tials of this regime at the time of consideration of the Credentials 
Committee report by the Assembly and moved an amendment to 
the effect that this report may be kept in abeyance and the seat 
of Kampuchea be kept vacant for the time being.  The Indian 
proposal was however defeated by 39 votes in favour 76 against 
and 23 abstentions.  The recommendations of the Credentials 
Committee with regard to the seating of democratic Kampuchea 
were accepted by the General Assembly. 
 
   <br><br>  The substantive aspect of this question was considered by the 
General Assembly from 12 to 14 November.  The ASEAN 
countries, supported by the Western group, introduced a draft 
resolution which was later amended considerably to incorporate 
the view points of several Non-aligned countries.  Vietnam 
also tabled its own draft resolution.  India did not support any 
of these resolutions.  It submitted its own draft resolution calling 
for a conference between the ASEAN countries and the States 
of Indo-China in order to alleviate tensions in the area  and 
to create an atmosphere conducive to peace, stability and coope- 
ration.  While Vietnam accepted India's initiative, the ASEAN 
countries rejected both the Indian and Vietnamese resolutions. 
India as such did not ask for a vote on its draft.  The General 
Assembly also decided, by a majority vote, not to consider the 
Vietnamese resolution, but this was opposed by India.  The 
ASEAN draft resolution was adopted by the Assembly.  India 
abstained in the voting on this resolution. 
 
  <br><br>   In view of the increased membership of the United Nations, 
with the admission to it of a large number of newly independent 
States from Africa, Asia and Latin America, India on behalf of 
Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Guyana, Maldives, 
Nepal, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, formally requested for inscription 
of a new item in the agenda pertaining to "the question of equit- 
able representation on and increase in the membership of the 
Security Council."  The intention of the sponsors was that the 
membership of the Security Council should be increased from 
the present 15 to 19.  The reactions from the permanent mem- 
bers of the Security Council, with the exception of China, was 
not favourable to this initiative.  Japan was in favour.  The 
General Committee which considers allocating of business, ap- 
proved the proposal for inscription of the item by 19 votes in 
favour, 5 against (USA, UK, USSR France and Byelorussia) 
and two abstensions.  China voted in favour. While introducing 
 
5--784EA/79 
                   <br><br>pg50<br><br>
 
the proposal in the plenary, the Permanent Representative 
of India made a forceful statement in favour of the proposal. 
After a short debate, the sponsors of the proposal decided to 
agree to a postponement of a decision on it, till the next session 
of the General Assembly, to enable more consultations to be 
held among the member states. 
 
   <br><br>  As in the past years, the General Assembly once again adopt- 
ed a resolution on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, 
sponsored by Pakistan, by 96 votes in favour, 2 against (India 
and Bhutan) and 40 abstentions.  India opposed the resolution 
because it was politically motivated and discriminated directly 
against India. In India's view, the question of a nuclear-weapon- 
free zone, in an artificially conceived segment of geography 
was impractical unless a total withdrawal of dismantling of 
nuclear-weapons took place in the whole area.  South Asia 
could not be singled out for the imposition of such a zone when 
nuclear weapons were located in its immediate neighbourhood. 
India was of the view that efforts to create such zones should 
emanate from the countries constituting the zone and should be 
voluntarily arrived at by them.  Attempts to create by imposition 
such zones could only divert attention from the fundamental goal 
of a world totally free of nuclear weapons. 
 
  <br><br>   The United Nations Disarmament Commission (UNDC) and 
the Committee on Disarmament (CD), established by the tenth 
special session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1978, accom- 
plished useful work.  The United Nations Disarmament Commis- 
sion (UNDC) reached agreement on the elements of a compre- 
hensive programme of disarmament, the details of which are to 
be negotiated by the Committee on Disarmament.  The Commit- 
tee on Disarmament reached agreement on rules of procedure, 
agenda, and programme of work.  China announced its inten- 
tion to participate in its work from 1980 when the membership 
of the negotiating body would rise to 40,  its envisaged  full 
strength.  Shri R. Jaipal of India was appointed Special Re- 
presentative of the Secretary-General to the Committee on Dis- 
armament and Shri M. A. Vellodi of India was re-elected Chair- 
man of the U. N. Disarmament Commission for 1980.  The 
work of the UNDC and CD was reviewed by the U.N. General 
Assembly and the follow-up action taken on the recommendations 
and decisions adopted at the tenth special session of the Assembly. 
India actively participated in the deliberations of these organisa- 
tions, in the field of nuclear-disarmament.  It stressed the impe- 
                    <br><br>pg51<br><br>
 
rative need for complete cessation of the production of nuclear 
weapons combined with a cut-off in the production of fissionable 
materials for weapon purposes; a comprehensive ban on the 
testing of nuclear weapons by all States in all environments and 
a total prohibition on the use of nuclear weapons.  India also 
emphasised the need for maintaining essential links between dis- 
armament and development so that a substantial portion of the 
resources released by disarmament could be utilised for develop- 
ment purposes particularly in the developing countries. 
 
    <br><br> In the field of economic matters, the General Assembly adopt- 
ed two resolutions on development and international cooperation. 
It decided to launch at its special economic session in 1980, 
a round of global, sustained and action-oriented negotiations.  The 
Assembly agreed that these negotiations could take place within 
the United Nations with the participation of all states and within 
a specified time frame.  By the other resolution, it was decided 
that the Committee of the Whole, acting as a preparatory com- 
mittee, should include in its final report suggestions and recom- 
mendations which might result from considerations of various 
proposals made by Heads of State  Government. A resolution 
was also adopted concerning food, the environment, a  new 
development strategy for the 1980s and the needs of the least 
developed countries.  Another resolution sought urgentimple- 
mentation of decisions adopted by the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). 
 
   <br><br>  The Assembly also adopted a series of resolutions on social, 
humanitarian and cultural issues.  A resolution on the world 
social situation expressed regret that most developed countries 
had not achieved specific targets of the international development 
strategy for the Social Development Decade and called on states 
to set priorities in such fields as education, health and housing. 
A draft code was approved for law enforcement officials which 
would bar the use of torture.  The resolution stated that every 
law enforcement agency should be representative of and account- 
able to the community as a whole.  India, during January 1979, 
deposited the unilateral declaration with the Secretary-General 
stating its intention to abide by the declaration adopted by the 
General Assembly in 1975 on the protection of all persons from 
being subjected to torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.  Another resolution sought the elabo- 
ration of the convention on the protection of migrant workers 
and called for the enlargement of the assistance programme for 
South African student refugees. 
              <br><br>pg52<br><br>
 
     In April 1979, India acceded to the two Covenants which 
seek to give legal basis to the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, i.e., International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (1966).  These entered into force  for 
India on 10 July 1979.  India after Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Phillip- 
pines and Syria was the sixth Asian country to became a party 
to these Covenants.  In the last session of the Commission on 
Human Rights, India took up the question of discriminatory 
treatment accorded to Asian immigrants by U.K.  The Commis- 
sion adopted a resolution expressing its deep concern and took 
note of the willingness of India and   U.K. to have a forthright ex- 
change of information and facts in order to clarify and resolve 
the situation. 
 
  <br><br>   The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held 
its eighth session at Geneva from 19 March to 21 April and again 
in New York from 16 July to 24 August 1979.  It discussed 
some outstanding issues relating to the international seabed area, 
i.e., the system of exploitation of its resources, financial arrange- 
ments between the International Seabed Authority and the contrac- 
tors, financial arrangements concerning the Enterprise, composition 
of and voting in the Council, relationship between the Assembly 
and the Council and settlement of disputes concerning the ex- 
ploitation of resources of the international seabed area.  It also 
discussed the outer limits of continental shelf, questions relating 
to maritime boundary and final clauses. 
 
    <br><br> The reports of the various Chairmen could not be submitted 
to the Conference sufficiently in time for their intensive considera- 
tion and this would now be discussed at the beginning of ninth 
session of the Conference in 1980. 
 
 <br><br>    India deposited its instrument of accession on 9 July 1979, 
simultaneously with U.S.A., U.K., and the USSR, to the two 
International Agreements relating to Outer Space.  These were : 
(a) Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astro- 
nauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, 1968 
(Astronauts Assistance Agreement); and (b) Convention  on 
International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. 
1972 (Liability Convention). 
 
   <br><br>  The General Assembly adopted on 5 December 1979, the 
Agreement governing the activities of states on the Moon and 
other Celestial Bodies.  The Agreement affirmed  (although 
            <br><br>pg53<br><br>
 
qualified) that the Moon and its resources were the common 
heritage of mankind and it provided for the establishment of an 
international regime to govern the exploitation of the natural 
resources of the Moon and other Celestial Bodies. 
 
    <br><br> India participated in the fourth meeting of Governmental 
Representatives to draft a Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material held at Vienna from 17 to 26 October 1979. 
The Convention, consisting of 23 Articles and two Annexes, 
would be referred by delegations to their authorities for considera- 
tion and would be open for signatures from 3 March 1980.  India 
expressed reservations regarding the scope of the Convention.  It 
stated that it should apply to all nuclear material, including 
nuclear material for military purposes, but should not apply to 
nuclear material used for peaceful purposes in domestic use sto- 
rage or transport, as this would be within national jurisdiction. 
It should, however, apply when the nuclear material was in the 
course of international transport. 
 
   <br><br>  India, as member of the United Nations Commission on Inter- 
national Trade Law (UNCITRAL), participated in its twelfth 
meeting, held at Vienna in June 1979.  It played a key role 
in the constitution of the Working Group on New International 
Economic Order and also participated in the working group on 
International Negotiable Instruments and International Contract 
Practices. 
 
    <br><br> India took part in the Diplomatic Conference for the adoption 
of Experts on Environmental Law met at Geneva in March and 
an international Character on the Sale and Purchase of Goods, 
held at Bucharest in May-June under the auspices of the Inter- 
national Institute for the unification of Private Law. 
 
    <br><br> The United Nations Environment Pollution Working Group 
of Experts on Environment Law met at Geneva in March and 
October 1979.  The group succeeded in preparing 18 draft prin- 
ciples covering environmental impact assessment, consideration of 
environmental monitoring and transfrontier pollution from off- 
shore mining and drilling within the limits of national jurisdiction 
of a state. 
 
    <br><br> The General Assembly adopted, by consensus in December, 
the International Convention Against Taking of Hostages. The 
Convention made it an offence to hold any person as hostage for 
the purpose of securing fulfilment of something as a condition for 
his release.  The basic principle underlying the Convention was 
                 <br><br>pg54<br><br>
 
that it provided for the obligation of contracting states to either 
prosecute the offender or to extradite him to the state of his 
nationality or to the state of the nationality of the hostage or 
else to the state where the offence was committed.  On the 
recommendations of the Ad hoc Committee on International 
Terrorism, composed of 35 members, including India, the Gene- 
ral Assembly adopted a resolution on 17 December condemning 
all facts of international terrorism which endangered or took 
human lives or jeopardised fundamental freedoms. 
 
    <br><br> The twentieth session of the Asian-African Legal Consul- 
tative Committee was held at Seoul in February 1979.  Among 
other things it considered the subjects of the law of the sea, en- 
vironmental law and international trade law.  It also convened 
intersessional Working Group meetings in December 1979 on 
marine pollution and optimum utilisation of fishery resources in

preparing background studies regarding regional cooperation for 
rapid industrialisation in the context of the New International

                   <br><br> FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
 
  <br><br>   During the year the Ministry was actively associated in the 
development of India's foreign economic relations. 
 
    <br><br> Substantial progress was made in the field of technical 
cooperation with developing countries.  A large number of 
important delegations from African and West Asian countries 
visited India in connection with the selection of experts and 
Other personnel in diversified fields.  The requests from these 
countries were met through the well-established practice of com- 
municating panels compiled by Foreign Assignment Section in 
the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms. 
Technical agencies like Rail India Technical and Economic 
Services Ltd. (RITES), Telecommunications Consultants India 
Ltd. (TCIL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) also entered 
into specific agreements with recruiting organisations for this 
purpose.  In addition, more than 70 experts were deputed, under 
the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) pro- 
gramme to developing countries.  Training facilities were provid- 
ed for 78 trainees from such countries on the civilian side and 
411 in Defence establishments. 
 
   <br><br>  Notable advance was also made in the field of economic co- 
operation with developing countries.  Government credits, amount- 
ing to a total of Rs. 22.40 crores, were granted to such countries, 
in addition to commodity loans of 50,000 tons of wheat and 
150,000 tons of rice.  A total number of 28 joint ventures, mainly 
in developing countries, were approved and India also succeeded 
in augmenting its project exports particularly in West-Asia and 
North African regions.  Efforts continued for entering into long- 
term arrangements and agreements with developing countries 
for meeting India's needs of essential commodities such as crude 
oil, fertilisers, rock phosphates, phosphoric acid. 
 
  <br><br>   India also participated actively in elaborating, through 
multilateral mechanisms, concepts and programmes of coopera- 
tion.  It played an important role in formulating the Arusha 
Programme of Collective Self-Reliance and Action Programme 
on Economic Cooperation among Non-aligned and other 
Developing Countries which was adopted at the Non-aligned 
 
                  <br><br>pg55<br><br>
                      pg56<br><br>
 
Summit at Havana.  A meeting of officials from developing 
countries was organised for examining possibilities of cooperation 
among State Trading Organisations.  The National Industrial 
Development Cooperation completed a study on the fullest 
possible use of complimentarities among Non-aligned and other 
developing countries in terms of resources, endowments and 
Industrial Technological capabilities.  The Non-aligned Summit 
at Havana while noting with appreciation the preparation of this 
study, entrusted an Expert Group with the task of analysing this 
report and formulating concrete projects.  These would be 
presented to the Ministerial Conference of Non-aligned countries 
that would be held in India in 1981.  India was also host to the 
meeting of the Expert Group from the consultancy organisations 
from Non-aligned and other developing countries which agreed 
on the establishment of the Project Development Facility, 
Statutes for which would be elaborated and finalised in the near 
future. 
 
    <br><br> On-going cooperation with neighbouring countries in South 
Asia progressed satisfactorily. 
 
   <br><br>  With countries of West Asia and North Africa, the main 
stress was on supply of skilled and unskilled manpower and 
deputation of experts.  With non-oil exporting countries such as 
people's Democratic Republic of Yemen and Syria, a beginning 
was made to foster technical cooperation under the ITEC pro- 
gramme. 
 
   <br><br>  India and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe continued 
to examine particularly in the framework of the Joint Commis- 
sions, measures for further strengthening and promoting economic 
cooperation in the light of emerging needs and possibilities. 
 
   <br><br>  With developed countries, Indian efforts for persuading them 
to take helpful decisions relating to official development assist- 
ance, debt relief measures and elimination of trade barriers did 
not meet with success. 
 
    <br><br> In the field of multilateral economic relations, India devoted 
considerable attention to the subject of energy.  A study was made 
of the implications of the rising cost of energy and different 
ramifications of the problem.  The subject was raised in successive 
multilateral fora.  The Non-aligned Summit at Havana adopted 
an important Resolution on "Policy Guidelines for Reinforcing 
Collective Self-Reliance among Developing Countries".  The 
Resolution inter-alia, referred to Non-aligned countries granting 
        <br><br>pg57<br><br>
 
one another priority of supply for their exportable primary 
products and commodities for meeting their respective minimum 
needs on a planned and assured basis.  This decision was further 
adopted at the level of the Group of 77 and also endorsed at the 
December Meeting of OPEC.  While favouring the proposal for 
the launching of a Global Round of Negotiations for discussions 
of matters relating to energy, raw-materials, trade, development, 
money and finance, India together with like-minded countries, 
continued to lay stress on economic cooperation among developing 
countries and on the need for elaborating, by the Group of 77, 
a strategy that would be conducive to increasing their bargaining 
power vis-a-vis the developed world. 
 
  <br><br>   India participated actively in the preparations, at the regional 
level, and at the level of the Group of 77 for UNCTAD-V, 
UNCSTD, and UNIDO-III.  Important contribution was made 
for elaborating the ESCAP input for the formulation of the 
International Development Strategy for the 1980s.  India was 
elected the Chairman of the Group of 77 for the period October 
1979 to September 1980.

<tr class="evenRow"><td> CHAPTER X 
 
                    <br><br> EXTERNAL PUBLICITY 
 
    <br><br> In the context of the growing inter-connection between 
public opinion and the processes of formulation of foreign 
policy and the significance of public relations in this  regard, 
the importance of extenral publicity work need hardly be em- 
phasised.  The External Publicity Division of the Ministry conti- 
nued to be responsible for the overall task of publicity affecting 
India's foreign relations.  It also coordinated and  supervised 
the work of the information and cultural wings of Indian missions 
abroad.  They were briefed and assisted to interpret all aspects 
of India's foreign policy to the public and the media in their 
respective countries.  They were also kept informed of the 
political, economic, social and cultural developments in India in 
a manner as to make foreign countries and people interested in 
developing and expanding relations with India. 
 
   <br><br>  The Division performed these functions through briefing of 
Indian as well as foreign press corps resident in India, publica- 
tion of magazines, periodicals and pamphlets, special supple- 
ments on India in foreign newspapers, organisation of visits by 
foreign  to India and Indian journalists abroad and 
publicity through films, radio and other audio visual means. 
 
     <br><br>The External Publicity Division had to deal with situations 
in ferment both in terms of domestic developments in India 
and India's external relations. Political  uncertainties  which 
characterised Indian politics during the year put a special 
responsibility on the Division to project Indian developments in 
correct  perspective abroad.  The critical developments in Indo- 
China, West-Asia, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan required 
correct  interpretation and projection of the evolving nuances of 
India's  foreign policy. 
 
    <br><br> An  additional factor which influenced the Division's work 
was the  criticism and evaluation of its role, made by the Parlia- 
ment anti public over the previous two or three years.  These 
developments and tasks were met with purposiveness and flexi- 
bility in spite of limitations in terms of resources and manpower 
 
                    <br><br>pg58<br><br>
                     pg59<br><br>
 
     An initiative was taken to improve India's external publicity 
operations in qualitative terms, by the appointment of a Com- 
mittee, under the Chairmanship of Shri Chanchal Sarkar, en- 
trusted with the task of making suggestions for improving India's 
external publicity effort.  On Mar 28, 1979, the Minister of 
External Affairs, Shri A. B. Vajpayee, presented to Parliament 
the report of this Committee.  He highlighted its major re- 
commendations, namely, the formulation of a precisely worked 
out training programme, the setting up of production centres in 
selected Indian missions abroad (with adequate personnel and 
equipment) and the proposal to increase by 30% the publicity 
budget of the Ministry.  The recommendations of the Committee 
have been accepted in principle by the Ministry and will be 
implemented subject to availability of resources. 
 
    <br><br> Special publicity efforts were made by the Division in pro- 
jecting India's firm commitment to democracy and non-align- 
ment, to the establishment of a new international economic 
order, to moral and material support for majority rule in Namibia 
and Zimbabwe and to the cause of the United Nations in up- 
holding peace and security in this world. 
 
    <br><br> The publicity and information activities of the Division were 
carried out under the following major heads : 
 
<br><br>(i) Press Relations 
 
   <br><br>  During the year, 40 journalists visited India as Government 
guests, for whom local hospitality, and in some cases inter- 
national passage, was extended by the Ministry.  The 250 foreign 
journalists who visited India on. their own were also given all 
possible help.  Fifty TV and photographic teams visited India 
for making documentary films on various subjects relating to 
our country's culture, history and democratic institutions.  One 
hundred Indian journalists, who went abroad, were assisted by 
the External Publicity Division. 
 
<br><br>(ii) Audio Visual Publicity 
 
  <br><br>   Publicity through documentary and feature films has always 
been an effective medium.  Eight hundred prints of 45 docu- 
mentary films were supplied to 110 Indian missions abroad. 
Four prints of a colour documentary "Where Centuries Co- 
Exist" were ordered for non-commercial exhibition and for tele- 
casting in Europe, Latin America and Asia.  Two colour docu- 
mentaries "India's Industrial Progress" and "Sharing of our 
   <br><br>pg60<br><br>
 
Technical Know-how and Experience with the Developing 
Countries" are being produced in the Film Division for exhi- 
bition abroad. 
 
  <br><br>   Five quality feature films : Manthan, Ankur, Nishant, Choti 
Si Baat and Benam, were sub-titled in English, Spanish, French 
and Arabic.  External Publicity Division is processing the pur- 
chase of eight prints each of 12 feature films and some children's 
films. 
 <br><br>  With the films available in their stock and those specially 
supplied from headquarters, several Indian  missions  abroad 
were able to participate in local film festivals. 
 
   <br><br>  The 16 mm cine projectors and radio-cassette-tape recorders 
were sanctioned for five Indian missions abroad.  Fifty gramo- 
phone records of Indian music and National Anthem were sup- 
plied to 20 Indian missions abroad. 
 
<br><br>(ii) Transmissions 
 <br><br>
     The twice-daily news transmissions broadcast to 45 Indian 
missions abroad through the Overseas Communication Service 
kept them adequately informed of the day-to-day developments 
in the country.  Each transmission, which was improved both 
in lay-out and content, carried on the average 1050 words. 
Twice-a-week press cables were sent to 27  Indian  missions 
abroad, not equipped to receive the daily transmissions. 
 
   <br><br>  In 1979, the Indian missions at New York, Washington, 
San Francisco and Ottawa were linked through the newly intro- 
duced press bulletin service via satellite.  The question of link- 
ing Indian missions abroad in other regions via satellite is being 
actively considered. 
 <br><br>
(iv) Printed Publicity 
 
 <br><br>    The External Publicity Division supplied publicity material 
produced by other ministries, as well as material  (booklets, 
pamphlets, etc.) brought out by the Division itself, to all the 
Indian missions abroad.  The Division's publication included 
the Foreign Affairs Record (monthly), Courier de L'Inde (a 
fortnightly in French) and the Indian and Foreign Review (a 
fortnightly).  The Indian &amp; Foreign. Review was improved both 
in content and in lay out and its circulation stepeed up from 
      <br><br>pg61<br><br>
 
13,500 in 1978-79 to 18,600 in 1979-80, in response to the 
demands from the Missions.  The feasibility of bringing out the 
Review in other foreign languages is being examined. 
 
   <br><br>  Some of the special booklets issued by the External Publicity 
Division include : (i) "News Agency Journalism Course for 
Non-aligned", (ii) "SAVIRA-A Scheme for Adoption of 
Villages by Indian Nationals Abroad", (iii) "Mother Teressa- 
Nobel Peace Prize Laurete for 1979".  These were in addition 
to pamphlets brought out on state and official visits of the Presi- 
dent and the Prime Minister. 
 
   <br><br>  The Division made special arrangements to keep the Indian 
missions abroad informed of the general elections held in 
January 1980.  The following material was sent in advance to 
all the Indian missions abroad : 
 
    <br><br> (i)  Booklet brought out by the External Publicity 
          Division--India Prepares for the Elections. 
 
     <br><br>(ii) Copy of the Election Commission's letter giving de- 
          tails on voting rights of Indians living abroad. 
 
    <br><br> (iii) Background note prepared on the elections to the Lok 
          Sabha based on material provided by the Election 
          Commission of India. 
 
    <br><br> (iv) A circular letter dated 19 December 1979 enclosing 
          charts on nominations filed and withdrawn, partywise, 
          in each State of India. 
 
    <br><br> (v)  A circular letter dated 22 December 1979 enclosing 
          summaries of the election manifestoes of the principal 
          political parties. 
 
    <br><br> Apart from this material, special transmission arrangements, 
through satellite and wireless were made for conveying news 
regarding election results to the Indian missions abroad.  The 
External Publicity Division also made logistical  arrangements 
for 110 journalists, including foreign radio/television teams, who 
came specialty to cover Indian elections and attendant events. 
 
   <br><br>  Two hundred and fifty books on Indian history, philosophy, 
religion, art, and culture, etc. were supplied to 68 Indian mis- 
sions abroad for their libraries and for presentation to local 
dignitaries and institutions. A large number  of articles and 
backgrounders were sent to the Indian missions  abroad for use in 
their own publications and for distribution to   the local news 
media. 
             <br><br>pg62<br><br>
 
    <br><br> Surveys and supplements on India which created greater 
awareness of the country's economic and industrial develop- 
ments and cultural heritage were brought out by foreign news- 
papers and periodicals on major events like the Republic Day 
and the Independence Day.  The External Publicity Division 
and the Indian missions abroad were actively associated in the 
production of these supplements.  The Trade Fair Authority of 
India also helped us on this.  Four special supplements were 
issued during 1979-80. 
 
   <br><br>  The World Press Review containing comments on or of 
interest to India in foreign newspapers and periodicals continued 
to be brought out in cyclostyled form.  On hundred ninety- 
nine issues were released during the nine-month period April 
to December 1979. 
 
<br><br>(v) Visual Material 
 
   <br><br>  Posters, books, paintings, pictures and photographs were 
supplied to 14 missions for participation in local exhibitions. 
Toys and musical instruments were sent to four Indian missions 
abroad.  These were sent to three missions with the help of the 
Indian Council for Cultural Relations. 
 
   <br><br>  The renovation and redesigning of the Indian pavilion at the 
Commenwealth Institute in London was completed by the 
National Institute of Designs, Allahabad, at a cost of Rs. 22.5 
lakhs.  The exhibition was inaugurated by the Minister of Ex- 
ternal Affairs, Shri S. N. Mishra, on 9th August 1979. 
 
   <br><br>  Ten thousand photographs (black and white) were sent to 
the Indian missions abroad.  The photographs covered develop- 
ment activities, cultural and social efforts, and subjects of topical 
interest. 
 
   <br><br>  One hundred sets of 62 slides each, an assorted collection of 
transparencies depicting India's steel mills projects, temples, 
places of historical and cultural interest etc. were supplied to the 
Indian missions abroad.

<tr><td> CHAPTER XI 
 
                 <br><br>   CULTURAL RELATIONS 
 
    <br><br> The Indian Council for Cultural Relations continued to work 
as the main agency for promoting cultural relations between 
India and other countries.  The field of its activities expanded 
as a result of the transfer to it of some of the cultural activities 
carried out by the Ministry of Education and Culture.  There 
was a reorganisation and increase in the staff of the Council to 
cope up with this additional work.  The Council opened its fifth 
Regional Office at Varanasi on Jun 01, 1979. 
 
   <br><br>  The Council, during the period April to December 1979, 
sent 56 visitors and 22 delegations to a number of countries 
South-East Asia, West Asia, U.S.A., Eastern and Western 
Europe, Africa, Fiji, Australia as well as to neighbouring coun- 
tries.  Many well-known Indian artistes, including dancers and 
musicians, gave performances at various  cities/countries in- 
cluding prestigious international festivals.  Commendatory re- 
ferences were received regarding these visits and the perfor- 
mances given by the artistes. 
 
  <br><br>   Under the programme of inviting delegations from abroad, 
the Council received 68 guests who had specialised in various 
fields ranging from fine arts and literature to education, 
science, medicine and technology.  They came from Afghanistan, 
Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, 
Egypt, England, Federal Republic  of  Germany,  Fiji, 
Ghana, Greece, German Democratic Republic,  Hungary, 
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, 
Lebanon, Mauritius, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Syria, Thailand, 
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.  Each visitors programme 
was carefully drawn up to give him a balanced idea of 
India's rich heritage and to assist him in meeting the right persons 
in the field of his interest.  This programme had a favourable 
impact as was evident from the requests being received for such 
visits from Indian missions abroad. 
 
   <br><br>Under the Cultural Exchange Programme, the Council re- 
ceived sixteen performing delegations numbering 156 persons. 
These included : a three-member Mime Artistes Troupe from

   <br><br>  The Council continued to oversee the activities of the Foreign 
Cultural Centres in India.  The seven British Libraries at 
Bangalore, Bhopal, Lucknow, Patna, Pune, Ranchi and Tri- 
vandrum continued to be administered by the Council as before. 
Two new British Libraries, one  in Ahmedabad and the other in 
Hyderabad, started functioning from March and August respec- 
tively as part of the existing system.  Funds were received regu- 
larly from the British Council Division for the management of 
these Libraries.  A meeting of the Consultative Committee of 
the British Libraries was held on 14 September 1979.  The 
House of Soviet Culture at Trivandrum organised a number of 
film shows, Russian language classes, exhibitions, talks and 
seminars aiming at projecting Soviet life and culture.  The Coun- 
cil maintained liaison with eight Max Mueller Bhavans in India, 
which are at Bangalore, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Hyderabad, 
Madras, Pune and Rourkela.  It also remained in touch with 
the activities of the eight Alliances Francaises. located at Banga- 
lore, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Karikal, Madras, Pondicherry 
and Pune.  In addition to this, close liaison was maintained with 
the Educational Resources Centre, New Delhi, which collects

   <br><br>  A New Jury for the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for Inter- 
national Understanding was constituted at the end of March 
                     <br><br>pg67<br><br>
 
1979 for a period of three years.  The Vice President of India, 
at a Press Conference on 13 November, announced the con- 
ferment of the Award for 1979 on Mr. Nelson R. Mandela, the 
imprisoned leader of South Africa. 
 
    <br><br> The Council received about 500 foreign students under various 
scholarship schemes of the Government of India.  Six Summer 
Camps for 450 students were organised in the months of May 
and June 1979 and twelve Study-tours were organised for about 
600 students during the year. 
 
    <br><br> A substantail number of new titles were added to the 
Library of the Council which has nearly 50,000 books and also 
houses the Library of the Indian Centre for Africa.  The 
Library has a good number of members and receives 300 to 350 
research scholars per month. 
 
   <br><br> The Scheme for providing educational facilities in medicine 
and engineering to self-financing students from developing coun- 
tries was continued during the year.  Out of 1083 applications 
for admission to the medical course received from nearly 35 
countries, 71 students were selected and nominated to various 
medical colleges in India.  In addition, 3 out of 5 applicants 
from Bhutan and 14 out of 210 applicants from Nepal were 
nominated for M.B.B.S. Course.  Similarly, 196 students from 
out of 782 applicants were selected and nominated to various 
engineering colleges including IITs.  Three candidates out of 
four applicants from Bhutan and 42 candidates out of 
90 applicants from Nepal were nominated for engineering 
courses. 
 
  <br><br>   Requests from foreign students also started coming, during 
the year, for admission to different polytechnic  institues  in 
India for Diploma courses and 35 foreign students were nomi- 
nated to such courses.

<tr><td>        CHAPTER XIII 
 
        <br><br>  PASSPORT, EMIGRATION AND CONSULAR SERVICES 
 
    <br><br> There was further progress towards creating an administrative 
machinery that would provide, in a simple and easy fashion, pass- 
port and related facilities to Indian citizens wishing to travel 
abroad.  Five new Passport Offices were opened at Bhuba- 
neshwar, Patna, Gauhati, Srinagar and Jullundur to serve the 
needs of the people of those states which were earlier covered 
by Passport Offices located in capitals of nearby states.  This 
raised the total number of Passport Offices from 13 in 1978 to 
18 by the end of 1979.  A proposal to open a Passport Office 
in Simla is under consideration. 
 
  <br><br>   Substantive changes were made in the rules and regulations 
appertaining both to the issue of passports and to the granting 
of emigration clearances to Indian workers going abroad for 
employment purposes.  This was done with a view to making 
the rendering of these services more trouble-free and expeditious 
to members of the public. 
 
    <br><br> The number of applications received and the number of 
passports issued and miscellaneous services rendered by each of 
the Passport Offices are given at appendix VI.  The statement 
also gives detail of diplomatic and official passports issued or 
serviced by the Ministry during the year.  During 1979, 
8,51,288 passports were issued.  The average time taken for 
issuing ordinary passports, where the applications were com- 
plete in all respects, was approximately three weeks.  In urgent 
cases, on humanitarian or other considerations, passports were 
issued within twenty-four hours. 
 
   <br><br>  A revised version of the passport application form was intro- 
duced on Jun 01, 1979.  Now only one copy of the application 
form is required to be filled as against two earlier.  The new 
application form was introduced in 11 regional languages, apart 
from English and Hindi, in order to meet the needs of the com- 
mon man who might prefer to fill his passport application form 
in the language of his region.  A comprehensive Note for 
Guidance, now supplied free along with the passport application 
 
                   <br><br>pg69<br><br>
                     pg70<br><br>
 
proved useful to the members of the public in filling the applica- 
tion form.  A simpler special version of the passport application 
form was introduced for Indians resident abroad. 
 
   <br><br>  The merit of procedural improvements such as the liberali- 
sation of authorisation for signing Verification Certificates, the 
waiving of the requirement of providing a Financial Guarantee 
where the passport applications had been verified by the compe- 
tent authority, the facility of being able to buy passport applica- 
tion forms from post offices throughout India and the practice of 
despatching passports through postal channels to the applicants 
in order to save them the inconvenience of having to collect them 
personally, were greatly appreciated by the members of the 
public.  The number of passport applications supported by 
Verification Certificates rose to approximately 60 per cent in 
1979 as compared to 52 per cent in 1978.  The facility of the 
sworn-affidavit system, under which passport applications accom- 
panied by such an affidavit are exempted from prior police 
verification, was increasingly used where the applicant found it 
difficult to get a Verification Certificate. 
 
    <br><br> A number of proposals were under active consideration to 
further improve the quality of services rendered by the Central 
Passport and Emigration Organisation.  These included the 
introduction of a new passport booklet, smaller in size with more 
pages and with a flexible cover, the introduction of a Passport 
Fee Postal Stamp which would simplify making payment and 
accounting procedures and the gradual induction of computerised 
methods in respect of storage/retrieval of factual information 
relating to passports issued. 
 
     <br><br>In 1979 the total revenue earned by Passport Offices was 
Rs. 528.50 lakhs as compared to a revenue of Rs. 483.56 lakhs 
in 1978.  The expenditure in 1979 was Rs. 143.19 lakhs as 
compared to Rs. 145.03 lakhs in 1978. 
 
    <br><br> The exodus of Indian workers to the countries of West Asia 
and North Africa for employment continued unabated during 
the year.  Various steps were taken to facilitate their smooth 
emigration and protection from exploitation, both in India and 
abroad, at the hands of unscrupulous agents and/or foreign 
employers. 
 
    <br><br> Following a Cabinet decision in 1976, the Minister of 
Labour had been made the focal point to examine applications 
                     <br><br>pg71<br><br>
 
for emigration. of Indian workers.  In 1979, however, after 
hearing a number of writ petitions, the Supreme Court of India 
passed an order on 20 March laying down certain guidelines 
within which the applications for emigration were to be pro- 
cessed.  These guidelines were to remain in operation till 
31 July but in another order passed on 30 July and 21 August, 
the Supreme Court extended this period to 31 January 1980.  It 
was also reiterated that during this period emigration clearances 
were to be granted only in accordance with the guidelines laid 
down by the earlier order and that no new conditions were to be 
imposed.  In accordance with these guidelines the work for 
processing of applications for emigration shifted back to the 
Protectors of Emigrants and the system of licensing of recruiting 
agents and insistence on minimum terms and conditions of 
employment were dispensed with. 
 <br><br>
     The Ministry made efforts to render the process  of emigra- 
tion as simple as possible for the emigrant workers.  In order 
to avoid inconvenience, all the Passport Offices were  authorised 
to issue the No Objection Certificates which earlier  could be 
issued only from limited points where Protectors of  Emigrants 
were in position.  Emphasis was laid on minimising the time 
taken for the grant of emigration clearances. The  system of 
security deposits was streamlined to avoid exploitation of the 
Indian workers at the hands of unscrupulous elements.  Round- 
the-clock emigration checks at all  international  embarkation 
points were instituted so that emigrants could leave India only 
after registering their employment with the concerned authorities. 
 
   <br><br>  With the liberalisation of emigration procedures and increas- 
ing awareness of the benefits of registration of employment 
agreements there was substantial increase in the number of 
emigration applications.  During 1979 the total registration of 
employment agreements is likely to cross the 200,000 mark 
whereas it was only 69,006 in 1978.  However, reports of func- 
tioning of unscrupulous agents continued to be received and the 
Ministry alerted the concerned authorities and the State govern- 
ments to be vigilant against these elements. 
 
  <br><br>   Meanwhile, the proposal to introduce new legislation on 
emigration has reached an advanced stage.  Approval of the 
caluent was being sought to introduce bill in the Partiament 
at the earliest.  In the proposed new legislation there is provi- 
sion of emigration of skilled and unskilled workers on equal 
footing and for regulatory controls on the recruiting agents.  It 
                      <br><br>pg72<br><br>
 
has also been proposed to transfer the work relaing to emigra- 
tion in the Allocation of Business rules from the Ministry of 
External Affairs to the Ministry of Labour. 
 
  <br><br>   The Indian missions/posts abroad weer told to give high 
priority to rendering efficient and courteous Consular services to 
Indians residing abroad or travelling to foreign countries.  They 
were directed to request visitors, selected on a random basis, to 
record their views about the quality of assist service and assis- 
tance rendered to them.  Twenty-five missions/posts abroad 
sent their reports in a prescribed proforma.  Ninety per cent of 
the proforma received indicated that they were satisfied with the 
courtesy and responsiveness shown to them by the members of 
the Consular sections concerned. 
 
 <br><br>    Indian missions abroad extended financial assistance to 56 
Indian nationals who got stranded abroad.  The number of 
destitute Indians repatriated from abroad was 444 which com- 
pared favourably with the figure of 1378 during 1978.  The 
Government WA up with the relevant foreign authorities the 
question of settlement of claims and/or compensation regarding 
354 Indians who died abroad during the year. 
 
  <br><br>   A large number of judicial, commercial and educational 
documents, 71001 in number, required for submission by private 
parties or government undertakings to foreign governments/ 
embassies, were attested during 1979. 
 
   <br><br>  In view of the rising cost of maintaining Indian missions/ 
posts abroad, the rates of Consular Fees were revised upward 
with effect from 2 April.  Similarly, the visa fees charged from 
foreign nationals, intending to visit India, was also revised 
upward in consonance with the increase in the fees charged by 
foreign countries from Indian nationals.

              <br><br> ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANISATION 
 
    <br><br> Shri A. B. Vajpayee and Shri S. Kundu, Minister and Minis- 
ter of State of External Affairs, relinquished charge consequent 
on the resignation of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji 
Desai, on Jul 15, 1979.  Shri S. N. Mishra took office as the 
new Minister of External Affairs on 28 July 1979 and Shri B. 
Barua as Minister of State of External Affairs on 13 August 
1979.  Following the results of the mid-term General Electtions, 
S/Shri S. N. Mishra and B. Barua demitted their respective 
offices and Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao assumed charge as Minis- 
ter of External Affairs on 14 January 1980. 
 
  <br><br>   There were a number of changes at the level of Additional 
Secretary and above.  On 19 November 1979, Shri J. S. Mehta, 
relinquished charge and Shri R. D. Sathe took over as the new 
Foreign Secretary.  S/Shri E. Gonsalves and R. Bhandari took 
over as Secretaries on 1 June 1979 and 1 August 1979 respec- 
tively, on the retirement of Shri U. S. Bajpai and M. A. Vellodi. 
Shri S. K. Singh took over as Additional Secretary (Administra- 
tion) on 6 June 1979, on the transfer to Kathmandu of Shri 
N. P. Jain.  During the year, 19 officers of Indian Foreign 
Service, belonging to Grades I to IV retired from service, includ- 
ing two on voluntary basis. 
 
  <br><br>   At the Headquarters, the Ministry of External Affairs com- 
prised 21 divisions (of which 9 were specialised divisions) with 
a total strength of 555 officers and 1890 non-gazetted members 
of staff.  Twenty-three officers were on deputation to the 
Regional Passport Offices, other Ministries and Departments of 
the Government of India and International Organisations. 
Appendix XI reflects the staff strength of the cadres of the 
IFS(A) and IFS(B).  The Ministry continued to be seized of 
the question of cadre review of IFS(B) to achieve rationalisation 
of cadre structure. 
 
    <br><br> Changing spectrum of the world scene and diplomatic acti- 
vity called for the administrative structure of the Ministry to be 
continuously strengthened and adjusted to the new priorities 
Two new Indian missions were opened at Abidjan (Ivory Coast)

and Salisbury (Zimbabwe) and the number of resident Indian 
missions/posts abroad during the year stood at 129.  In addition, 
India had concurrent accreditation in 46 countries.  The staff 
strength of the Indian missions/posts abroad was 698 diplomatic 
officers and 2,816 non-diplomatic staff, including locally- 
recruited employees.  A number of steps were initiated to 
streamline India's representation abroad so as to strike a right 
balance between the country's international interests and objec- 
tives and financial resources.  A review of the staffing pattern in 
Indian missions abroad was initiated in the interests of economy 
and efficiency.  India's consular and trade representation in the 
Gulf region too was strengthened with a view to meeting increas- 
ed obligations towards its resident Indian community and to 
widen the areas of economic and commercial relations with this 
region. 
 
  <br><br>   Recognising the imperative role of language expertise in the 
functional effectiveness of the Ministry, emphasis continued to 
be placed on the creation of a dependable cadre of language 
scholars and interpreters.  As many as 27 young Foreign Service 
officers acquired proficiency in a number of foreign languages. 
Now that the norms for the formation of an independent inter- 
preters' Cadre within the service have been finalised, in consul 
tation with the concerned Administrative bodies, the Ministry 
hopes to be in a position, before long, to recruit qualified 
linguists to the proposed Cadre.  A comprehensive list of the 
number of officers who have qualified in various languages is 
given at Appendix XII. 
 
   <br><br>  The total expenditure of the Ministry during the financial 
year 1979-80 is estimated to be of the order of Rs. 166.13 
crores. The expanded commitment  to Cooperation Projects and 
Programmes in Nepal and Bhutan; enhanced commitment of 
loans to Bangladesh; as also global  trends of inflation tended to 
increase requirements of resources.  The expenditure on the 
financing of the activities of Indian missions abroad increased 
but marginally from Rs. 33.54 crores to Rs. 34.69 crores.  The 
Ministry rationalized its staffing pattern and exercised stringent 
controls over the expenditure so as to entail little if any increase. 
Break-up of the overall expenditure is given at Appendices IX 
&amp; X. 
 
  <br><br>   In the context of world-wide escalation of rentals over the 
past few years, the Ministry intensified its efforts to acquire 
immovable property abroad for office accommodation and resi- 
                     <br><br>pg75<br><br>
 
dences for Heads of Mission and India-based personnel.  During 
the year, India acquired residences for Indian Ambassadors at 
Manila (Philippines) and Santiago (Chile); two apartments at 
Berne (Switzerland); eight semi-independent houses at London 
(UK) and two flats at Santiago.  A building was also purchased 
to accommodate the Chancery at Dublin (Ireland).  The policy 
of undertaking construction of own offices and residential pre- 
mises was vigorously pursued.  The Chancery building at 
Bangkok (Thailand) became ready for occupation.  Likewise, 
the Chancery building and apartments for all staff members at 
Ottawa (Canada) are expected to be ready by the end of the 
current financial year.  Plans and estimates were approved for 
construction of residential apartments  at  Lagos  (Nigeria), 
Jakarta (Indonesia) and Ankara  (Turkey). Preparation of 
preliminary plans and drawings etc. has been taken in hand in 
regard to construction at Colombo (Sri Lanka), Islamabad- 
(Pakistan), Lusaka (Zambia), Kathmandu (Nepal), Kabul 
(Afghanistan), Brasilia (Brazil), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), 
Kuwait and Canberra (Australia).  With the acquisition of 
built-up property during the current financial year, India would 
have owned office buildings in as many as 24 countries.  Heads of 
Mission residences in 54 countries, and office-cum-residences in 
five countries. 
 <br><br>
     The Welfare Unit of the Ministry continued to took after 
the general welfare of all the officers serving at Headquarters 
and Indian missions abroad, including the admission of their 
children in educational institutions and in promotion of cultural 
and social activities. 
 <br><br>
     Financial assistance was provided to some officials during 
their prolonged illness and to the bereaved families of the 
deceased officials from the Staff Benefit Fund.  Employment 
opportunities were also provided to the direct deserving depen- 
dents of the deceased officials.  A proposal for group insurance 
of all the Group 'D' employees of the Ministry out of the Staff 
Benefit Fund is currently under consideration. 
 
   <br><br>  A special Cell continued to function to watch and monitor 
the progress of implementation of the Reservation orders in res- 
pect of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Details regard- 
ing the number of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the 
total strength of the Ministry, the vacancies reserved for them 
and appointments made against these vacancies are given in

                         CHAPTER XV 
 
              <br><br>  USE OF HINDI IN OFFICIAL WORK 
 
  <br><br>   In keeping with the policy of the Government, the Ministry 
made every effort to encourage the use of Hindi in official work. 
The Official Language implementation Committee, headed by 
the Additional Secretary (Administration), met periodically to 
keep a watch on the implementation of the instructions issued 
by the Government on the subject.  Additional Secretary 
(Administration) also addressed a meeting of the Branch Officers 
to emphasise. the need to implement the Official Language Rules 
in right earnest.  Official Language Implementation Committees 
were set up during the year in a number of Indian missions 
abroad.  The Regional Passport Offices also constituted Official 
Language Implementation Committees to encourage the use of 
Hindi in their offices.  In order to ensure greater use of Hindi in 
the Ministry, all Heads of Division nominated an officer from 
their respective Division to liaise with the Hindi Branch. 
 
    <br><br> As during the previous year the Minister of External Affairs, 
Shri S. N. Mishra, addressed the thirty-fourth session of the 
United Nations General Assembly in Hindi.  This is considered as 
an appropriate step in the direction of giving Hindi its rightful 
place in the comity of nations. 
 
   <br><br>  Apart from the above, Hindi continued to be used extensively 
in protocol matters relating to international treaties and agree- 
ments.  Various documents like the Letters of Credence, Letters 
of Recall, Commission of Appointment and other protocol 
documents were prepared in Hindi and correspondence in Hindi 
between different departments of the Ministries and with the 
public was conducted increasingly in Hindi. 
 
   <br><br>  More Indian missions abroad were provided with Hindi type- 
writers.  In accordance with the decision already taken to supply 
at least one Hindi typewriter to each Mission, efforts are being 
made to achieve this target as soon as possible.  It is the intention 
of the Ministry to create more posts of Hindi Officers in Indian 
missions abroad and to post Hindi knowing typists/stenographers 
there.  This is meant to maximise the use of Hindi by them in 
their correspondence with the Ministry and, wherever possible, 
with local bodies. 
 
      <br><br>pg76<br><br>
                        pg77<br><br>
 
     Under the Scheme of the Propagation of Hindi Abroad, 
Hindi books and help literature continued to be sent to Indian 
missions abroad and to voluntary organisations abroad to meet 
the requirements of the people of Indian origin.  Hindi books 
and help literature worth about Rs. 312,000/- were sent to 
various Indian missions abroad during the year.  Special efforts 
were made to print and supply Hindi text books for primary 
schools in Fiji.  The Ministry continued to supply Hindi news- 
papers, wall newspapers, journals, etc., regularly for use in the 
libraries of Indian missions abroad. 
 
  <br><br>   The Ministry continued to render necessary assistance to 
foreign nationals and non-Hindi speaking employees to learn 
Hindi through correspondence courses. 
 
   <br><br>  The Children's Hindi Classes, started in 1977 in the Indian 
missions abroad, made steady progress.  Children of the members 
of staff in these Missions and the children of the employees of 
the Public Sector Undertakings took full advantage of this 
Opportunity.  At the behest of this Ministry, some of the voluntary 
Hindi organisations abroad also started Hindi classes for local 
nationals. 
 
  <br><br>   At the request of the Ministry, many of the Indian Missions 
abroad organised functions, with the assistance of the local 
Hindi organisations, on the occasion of the 500th birth anniver- 
sary of Mahakavi Surdas.  The event was celebrated in Delhi and 
other centres in India and eminent foreign Hindi scholars attended 
the function.  An International Hindi Conference was also held 
in Suriname in January 1979, with the assistance of the Indian 
Council for Cultural Relations, in which an eminent Hindi 
scholar from India participated. 
 <br><br>
     In accordance with the decision of the Award Committee, 
constituted under the Chairmanship of the Minister of External 
Affairs.  "Vishwa Hind Puraskar", was given to five eminent 
foreign Hindi scholars.  It was acclaimed, by writers and journa- 
lists, as a success and a positive step towards popularising Hindi 
in foreign countries. 
 <br><br>    The Indian Council for Cultural Relations adopted a com- 
prehensive programme of activities with the object of propagating 
Hindi abroad.  This was intended for strengthening cultural 
relations with foreign countries specialty in those areas of Asia, 
Africa and the Caribbean, where Hindi is widely understood by 
large sections of the population.  Two issues of the Hindi 
               <br><br>pg78<br><br> 
 
     Quarterly "Gagananchal" were published and distributed mainly 
in the foreign countries.  A special issue on Fiji is also being 
brought out to mark the 100 years of Indian migrations to Fiji. 
A book entitled "History of Indian Migrations to Fiji" has also 
been commissioned and is in the process of being published. 
 
   <br><br>  Enlarged programmes were undertaken for exchange of Hindi 
speaking artists, scholars, with the aim of strengthening cultural 
relations with Hindi speaking people abroad.  Hindi teaching 
arrangements continued, at the Chairs of Indian Studies abroad, 
to meet the needs of foreigners for learning the language.  In 
addition, in the Cultural Centres maintained by the Council in 
foreign countries, arrangements continued for the teaching of 
Hindi, besides instructions in Indian music, Classical dances etc. 
 
  <br><br>   As part of Book Presentation Programme sets of Hindi books 
were presented to learned institutions and libraries abroad.  A 
Hindi typewriter and a set of Hindi texts, supplementary books 
and journals were presented to the Kaliniya University of Sri 
Lanka. 
 
  <br><br>   A special orientation course for foreign students studying 
Hindi at the Central Hindi Institute was conducted in September 
1979. Hindi clases were also regularly held for the officials of the 
Council

The President of the Republic of France 
 
Valery GISCARD d'ESTAING 
 
and 
 
The Prime Minister of India 
Indira Gandhi 
 
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the international situation which 
could endanger world peace. 
 
Convinced of the necessity of basing international  relations on respect for 
the universally recognized principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
Conscious of the special responsibilities which devolve, in the present critica
l 
times, on France and India because of their respective policies of detente 
and non-alignment. 
 
1. Solemnly declare that 
 
<br><br>(i) Any situation arising out of the use of force in international relations 
    and intervention or interference in internal affairs of sovereign States 
    is inadmissible. 
 
<br><br>(ii) In order to stop further escalation, all States should refrain from 
    any action which could intensify great power rivalry and bring back 
    the cold war, especially through dangerous arms build-up liable to 
    threaten peace and stability in sensitive regions. 
 
<br><br>(iii) It is necessary to restore conditions in which the independence, sove- 
    reignty and territorial integrity of all States can be preserved and the 
    right of their peoples to freely determine their own destiny without 
    outside interference assured. 
 
<br><br>(iv) Respect for and implementation of those principles do not prejudice 
    any State's legitimate security interests and would, in fact, go a long 
    way towards safeguarding them. 
 
2. Accordingly, the President and the Prime Minister have decided to take 
all necessary initiatives to defuse present tensions and to help create a clima

of mutual trust and confidence.  To this end, they will remain in close con- 
sultation with each other. 
 
<br><br>3. The President and the Prime Minister appeal to all States, particularly 
the most powerful ones, to recognise the gravity of the danger and to bend 
all their efforts to avert it.

          MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 
                    1979-80 <br><br>
 
     The three months since the Report of the Ministry 
of External Affairs went to the press at the end of March, 
1980, were a period of intense diplomatic activity in which 
India played a patient and energetic role.  The two momen- 
tous events of these three months were the independence of 
Zimbabwe (18th April) and the death of Marshal Tito of 
Yugoslavia (4th May).  The Prime Minister was present 
at the ceremonies on both these occasions and had 
talks with several world leaders.  Amongst these were: 
President Brezhnev of the USSR, President Kolisevski of 
Yugoslavia, President Zia of Pakistan, President Kaunda 
of Zambia, President Nyerere of Tanzania, President Gierek 
of Poland, President Ceausescu of Romania, President 
Saddam Hussain of Iraq, President Shehu Shagari of 
Nigeria, President Sekou Toure of Guinea, the Vice- 
President of Cuba, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the 
FRG, Prime Minister Djuranovic of Yugoslavia, Prime 
Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Prime Minister 
Burnham of Guyana, Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher of 
Britain, Premier Ohira of Japan, Premier Hua Guo Feng 
of China, Secretary General Waldheim of U.N. and former 
Chancellor Willy Brandt of FRG.  These meetings emphasis- 
ed that there is expectation of greater contribution by 
India in healing the rifts between nations at a time of 
heightened peril to mankind. 
 <br><br>
     The underlying causes of tension in our region continued 
to fester as evidenced by the situations in Afghanistan, 
Iran and West Asia becoming interlocked.  The period 
also witnessed several important meetings of international 
leaders to resolve the differences arising over Afghanistan. 
These meetings vindicated the Indian position that there 
is no alternative to a political settlement. 
 
  <br><br>   India's concern and involvement and our continuing 
diplomatic activity have been reflected in visits abroad by 
Indian leaders and by our receiving foreign dignitaries. 
                     <br><br>pg1<br><br>
                      <br><br>pg2<br><br>
 
The Foreign Minister, Shri Narasimha Rao visited Paris 
and Bonn in March; Sardar Swaran Singh visited Islamabad 
in April; the Foreign Secretary, Shri R. D. Sathe visited 
Kabul in May and the Foreign Minister visited Moscow 
from 3rd to 7th June, in the course of which he met 
President Brezhnev and other Soviet leaders.  During the 
visit, matters of mutual interest were discussed, leading 
to a clear understanding of each other's points of view. 
The visit served to underline the importance that we and 
the Soviet Union attach to our mutual ties which are 
growing in strength and dimension. 
 
    <br><br> We also received the Foreign Ministers of Cuba, 
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania 
during this period.  Mr. Roy Jenkins, President of the 
Commission of the EEC, Dr. Ramphal, the Secretary of 
the Commonwealth Secretariat and Mr. Gisha Phillipov, 
Member of the Politburo of Bulgaria also visited India. 
 
    <br><br> The meeting of the Prime Minister with President 
Zia-ul-Haq at Salisbury was a pointer to the prospects of 
friendly cooperation and mutual understanding.  However, 
it was with regret and disappointment that India noted 
President Zia's uncalled for reference to Kashmir at the 
Islamic Foreign Ministers' Conferences in January and 
May, which we consider to be inconsistent with the spirit of 
the Simla Agreement. 
 <br><br>
     Bangladesh has proposed a summit meeting of six 
South Asian countries to promote regional cooperation. 
India has welcomed this and emphasised the need for care- 
ful preparatory work that must be done before a summit 
meeting could prove fruitful. 
 
    <br><br> The visit of Shri Eric Gonsalves, Secretary (East), to 
Rangoon in the first week of May for discussions with the 
Burmese Foreign Minister provided an opportunity to 
review cooperation and contacts with this neighbour. 
 
   <br><br>  Secretary (ER), Shri Romesh Bhandari, visited Iran in 
February and had discussions with President Bani Sadr 
and other Iranian leaders.  The visit to New Delhi of 
Mr. Reza Sadr, Commerce Minister of the Islamic Republic 
                    <br><br>pg3<br><br>
 
of Iran, in June 1980, who was accompanied by a number 
of Deputy Ministers of different Ministries including the 
Deputy Foreign Minister, was symbolic of the close relations 
between India and Iran and the desire to establish a new 
economic relationship between the two countries. 
 
    <br><br> Full diplomatic status to the PLO Mission in New 
Delhi was granted in March.  Chairman Yasser Arafat 
visited India at the invitation of the Prime Minister.  These 
two were significant developments in India's relations with 
the Arab world. 
 
   <br><br>  A PLO delegation visited India in May for the first 
meeting of the Joint Committee.  The talks covered com- 
prehensive cooperation between India and the PLO.  Special 
envoys from Oman, Iraq, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt visited 
India during this period.  Secretary (ER), Shri Romesh 
Bhandari, visited Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. 
 <br><br>
     The Iraqi Oil Minister Mr. Tayeh Abdul Karim led 
Iraq's delegation to the sixth session of the Indo-Iraq 
Joint Commission in April. 
 <br><br>
     President Carter issued an executive order in June 
authorising the supply of enriched uranium fuel for Tara- 
pur.  However, President Carter's executive order will lie 
in the Congress for sixty continuous days and will become 
effective unless overturned by both Houses of Congress. 
 
    <br><br> The Prime Minister visited Salisbury for the Indepen- 
dence celebrations of Zimbabwe at the invitation of Prime 
Minister Robert Mugabe.  The Indian delegation, which 
included the Foreign Minister, was treated with great 
friendship and warmth, being received and seen off by the 
President, Prime Minister and others in the new Govern- 
ment.  During their talks, India's readiness to help the new 
country in the task of rehabilitation was conveyed.  India's 
Liaison Mission in Salisbury was upgraded to a High 
Commission on 18 April.  Zimbabwe's membership of the 
Commonwealth is also a welcome development.  On their 
way to Zimbabwe, the Prime Minister and the Foreign 
Minister paid an official visit to Tanzania on 16-17 April. 
 
    <br><br> With the emergence of free Zimbabwe the focus of 
international attention in Africa must now shift to Namibia 
              <br><br>pg4<br><br>
 
and South Africa itself.  The Prime Minister met the 
SWAPO Leader, Mr. Sam Njoma, in Salisbury. 
 
    <br><br> Three African Heads of State who visited Delhi during 
this period were President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire 
(31 March-2 April), President Kaunda of Zambia and 
President France Albert Rene of Seychelles.  India is to 
open a resident mission in Mahe (Seychelles) in the near 
future. 
 
    <br><br> The first Indo-ASEAN dialogue at the official level 
was held in Kuala Lumpur on May 15, 1980-16, 1980.  The 
Indian delegation was led by Shri Eric Gonsalves, Secre- 
tary (East).  It was the first such dialogue between 
ASEAN and a developing country.  A broad joint pro- 
gramme of action in the areas of trade, industrial and 
scientific cooperation was agreed to.  As a preparatory 
step to the Indo-ASEAN dialogue, the Indian delegation 
visited all the ASEAN capitals and had useful discussions. 
 
    <br><br> India has tried to help relieve the food shortage in 
Kampuchea by sending rice and rice seeds, apart from 
medicines and baby food.  The question of recognition of 
the Heng Samrin regime is under the active consideration 
of Government. 
 
   <br><br>  The Vietnamese Prime Minister, Mr. Pham Van Dong, 
paid a State visit to India from April 7 to 12.  India 
agreed to extend a government to government credit of 
Rs. 5 crores to Vietnam to buy rolling stock, and industrial 
spare parts. 
 
  <br><br>   The Prime Minister met the Chinese Foreign Minister, 
Mr. Huang Hua, in Salisbury and the Chinese Premier, 
Mr. Hua Guo Feng in Belgrade.  The Chinese Foreign 
Minister is due to visit India later this year.  Preliminary 
discussions were held in mid-June when Shri Gonsalves, 
Secretary (East), visited Beijing.  India has made it clear 
that the quest for normalised relations with China is not 
at the cost of our friendship with any other country. 
 
    <br><br> Contacts with other countries in East Asia were main- 
tained.  Mr. S. Sonoda, a special emissary of Japanese 
Prime Minister visited India in March and Mr. Tong Jin 
Park, then Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea, at 
 
                    <br><br>pg5<br><br>
 
the end of March.  Shri Gonsalves visited Pyong Yang and 
Tokyo in June. 
 
 <br><br>    In view of the recent deterioration in international 
relations some non-aligned countries proposed an extra- 
ordinary Ministerial meeting in July 1980.  There was lack 
of consensus with regard to the venue, agenda and timing 
of the proposed conference.  The group of non-aligned 
countries meeting in New York on June 18, 1980, accepted 
India's compromise proposal that the regular Ministerial 
conference of non-aligned countries which was to be held 
in New Delhi in 1981 be advanced to the early weeks of 
1981 to review the international political and economic 
situation. 
 
    <br><br> India took an active part in ongoing negotiations for 
the formulation of the International Development Strategy 
for the Third Development Decade and in the preparation for 
the Global Round of negotiations.  Ministers of the Group 
of 77 met in New York in March 1980 to finalise their 
approach to the G77 proposals for the Agenda, time-frame 
and procedures for the Global Round of negotiations. 
Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, Minister of External Affairs, 
led the Indian delegation to this meeting. 
 
   <br><br>  India participated in the high level meeting on Technical 
Cooperation among Developing Countries held under the 
aegis of the UNDP from 26th May to 2nd June 1980. 
Indian initiatives on the enlargement of the scope of TCDC 
and of financial resources to strengthen TCDC activities 
were accepted and found a place in the documents of 
the meeting. 
 
    <br><br> The Foreign Minister undertook a review of the External 
Publicity Division in March, including the Chanchal Sarkar 
Committee Report.  The Ministry has come to the con- 
clusion that not all the recommendations of the Chanchal 
Sarkar Committee can be implemented.  The Ministry plans 
to increase the number of Information Sections in our 
Missions abroad in the next three years.  Twenty-five new 
Information Sections are expected to be opened subject to 
availability of resources.   A proposal to organise an 
editorial and re-write desk along with more printing 
          <br><br>pg6<br><br>
 
facilities at Headquarters is also being considered so as to 
produce publicity material in English, French, Spanish and 
German.  Our Centres in Cairo and Moscow to produce 
material in Arabic and Russian will also be strengthened. 
 
  <br><br>   Since March, 1980, a series of instructions have been 
issued to all our missions abroad providing guidelines for 
treatment of Indian visitors going abroad, and for inter- 
preting Indian developments in correct perspective.  Liaison 
has also been established with the Ministry of Information 
and Broadcasting, All India Radio, Department of Tourism 
and academic and other institutions involving publicity 
efforts within the institutional framework.  Action has 
also been initiated to improve the equipment and facilities 
available in our Missions abroad for all libraries, reading 
rooms and audio-visual publicity work.  Special attention 
is being directed to make our external publicity effort 
effective, purposive and prompt, taking into account the 
criticism and assessment of our external publicity work 
over the last few years.
