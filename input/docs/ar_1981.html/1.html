 Introduction  

<br><br>On the eve of India's independence Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was 

also its first Minister of External Affairs, told the Constituent Assembly: "An
d so we 
have to labour and to work, and work hard, to give reality to our dreams. Those
 
 dreams are for India, but they are also for the world, for all the nations and 
 peoples 
 are too closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can 
 live apart. 
 Peace has been said to be indivisible; so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and
  so also is 
 disaster in this One World that can no longer be split into isolated fragments.
 " This 
 vision of India's place in the world still beckons to all those concerned with 
 the conduct 
 of foreign affairs. 
  
  <br><br> The basic parameters of India's foreign policy laid down by the Founding Fath
 ers 
 more than thirty five years ago remain unchanged and have indeed acquired a new
  rele- 
 vance against the backdrop of a progressively deteriorating external environmen
 t. 
 These are: to preserve our sovereign independence, maintain the freedom of judg
 ement 
 and action as the essence of non-alignment, promote international peace and sta
 bility, 
 reduce world tensions and fashion a more equitable structure of international e
 conomic 
 cooperation on the basis of justice and fairplay. Rooted in India's traditions 
 of toler- 
 ance, non-violence, secularism and democracy, these goals are but a part of our
  larger 
 national commitment to self-reliant development in order to provide a better fu
 ture for 
 our people free from external threats or interference. India's domestic unity, 
 economic 
 strength and a purposeful leadership--invaluable assets in the conduct of any f
 oreign 
 policy--have again given the nation a fresh confidence to face new dangers that
  lurk on 
 the horizon beyond our frontiers. 
  
  <br><br> The most important political development of 1981-82 has been the continuing 
 
 downward slide and rapid deterioration in East-West relations. The structure of
  peace- 
 ful coexistence laboriously built up piece by piece in the last twenty years is
  in danger 
 of collapse. Peace, the eternal dream of mankind, has precariously survived by 
 the 
 rather negative consensus of mutual deterrence in the age of instant nuclear an
 nihila- 
 tion than positively by cooperation and confidence. At the same time a new cold
  war, 
 triggered by fear, suspicion and mistrust reminiscent of the fifties, has begun
  to pervade 
 virtually all aspects of international relations and, by vitiating the general 
 security envir- 
 onment, fuels a new wave of nuclear and conventional rearmament. The old strate
 gic 
 uncertainties, inherent in the doctrines of deterrence and massive retaliation,
  are being 
 aggravated. New advances in science and technology are also being utilised in i
 mprov- 
 ing and stockpiling chemical, biological and bacteriological weapons despite in
 ternational 
 conventions against their use. The same technological development has led to si
 gni- 
 ficant increases in the modernization, diversification and proliferation of con
 ventional 
 armaments of the nuclear-weapon powers and other States including some developi
 ng 
 countries. 
  
                    <br><br>           (iii) <br><br>
  
   Ironically, despite the massive militarization and accretion of military hard
 ware 
 by the super powers and their allies the contending alliance systems have been 
 unable to 
 guarantee global security and every effort to improve their respective military
  positions 
 by escalating the arms race causes further instability. Also, paradoxically, th
 e very arms 
 intended to assure external security tend to create internal repercussions that
  affect not 
 only bloc solidarity but have a destablising effect within the individual membe
 r coun- 
 tries. The decision to deploy more modern missiles has caused new fears in Euro
 pe 
 and spawned a peace movement that could profoundly affect the future of the reg
 ion. 
 Also, nationalism continues to assert itself and alliance leaders, unable to co
 ntain 
 national dissent through conventional means, have to contend with new realities
  and 
 resort to new techniques to protect what they consider to be their vital securi
 ty inter- 
 ests. At the same time, the ability of the big powers to control or moderate re
 gional 
 conflicts--which was an important function of international organization in the
  immedi- 
 ate post-war years--has been seriously undermined by their rivalries and mistru
 st. 
  
  <br><br> The epicentre of world tensions has clearly shifted front Europe to Asia. Thi
 s 
 is evidenced by the frantic build up of military and naval presences in the Ind
 ian Ocean, 
 search for new allies or bases, formation of rapid deployment forces, the gener
 al situation 
 in West Asia, the Gulf war between two non-aligned nations, the continuing prob
 lem in 
 Afghanistan, plans to build up a so-called strategic consensus in South West an
 d West 
 Asia, including the induction of sophisticated weapons into Pakistan, and the l
 ingering 
 tensions in South-East Asia. These developments have aggravated the security en
 viron- 
 ment of India and placed fresh burdens on our economy at a time when the countr
 y was 
 just beginning to recover from severe inflation and economic stagnation caused 
 by the 
 world energy crisis and other factors. 
  
  <br><br> This dangerous international political environment could be aggravated by the
  
 failure of the international community to solve some of the basic problems now 
 afflict- 
 ing the world economy especially the developing countries. The widening dispari
 ties 
 between developed and developing nations and disequilibrium in the major sector
 s of 
 world economic system such as trade, tariffs, finance cannot but affect India. 
 We can 
 hardly remain unaffected by growing populations in the developing countries, in
 ade- 
 quate food production and decreasing natural resources, particularly non-renewa
 ble 
 fossil fuels. The lack of progress on global negotiations for a New Internation
 al Eco- 
 nomic Order remains a major cause for concern. 
  
  <br><br> Against this sombre background of worsening political, economic and security 
 
 environment in Asia, India's foreign policy activity and initiatives were aimed
  at streng- 
 thening the Non-Aligned, Movement, improvement of relations with neighbours, pr
 event- 
 ing a drift towards war and big power confrontations, arresting the nuclear arm
 s race, 
 reducing regional and international tensions and promoting a dialogue towards a
  new 
 international economic order. The Prime Minister of India, Shrimati Indira Gand
 hi, 
 devoted considerable attention to foreign affairs and took personal interest in
  several 
 important issues of national and international concern. Her meetings with world
  leaders 
 at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference at Melbourne, and at the 
 Cancun Summit as well as in Europe and in India set the tone and direction of I
 ndia's 
  
                       <br><br>        (iv) 
  
<br><br> foreign policy activity. The Foreign Minister of India, who was closely associa
 ted with 
 these deliberations, also visited several important capitals and held talks wit
 h leaders 
 abroad and also received many of them in New Delhi. The principal thrust of Ind
 ia's 
 diplomatic activity in the year under review was thus to create greater interna
 tional 
 awareness of the dangers of big power confrontation in Asia and to safeguard ou
 r national 
 security and interests through non-alignment and the peaceful resolution of dif
 ferences. 
 Special attention was given to relations with India's neighbours. In the econom
 ic 
 sphere India endeavoured to give an impetus and a direction to North-South dial
 ogue 
 and on global negotiations. 
  
  <br><br> Significant developments have occurred over the last one year in India's rela
 tions 
 with Pakistan. At the beginning of the year, Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gan
 dhi 
 wrote to President Zia-ul-Haq calling for cooperation rather than confrontation
  and 
 underscoring India's policy and her personal commitment to respect the territor
 ial inte- 
 grity and sovereign equality of Pakistan. This was followed by the visit to Pak
 istan 
 of the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, in June. Despite 
 the fact 
 that Pakistan intends to acquire highly sophisticated weapons and armaments whi
 ch 
 could only lead to an arms race in the sub-continent, India expressed her willi
 ngness to 
 improve relations with Pakistan in the spirit of the Simla Agreement. Initial n
 egotia- 
 tions for a no-war pact between the two countries were held in New Delhi during
  the 
 visit of Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Mr. Agha Shahi, in January 1982. A positi
 ve 
 outcome of this meeting was the agreement to set up a joint commission for the 
 two 
 countries to review and promote bilateral relations. This initiative by India a
 s well as the 
 Prime Minister's statement that "pact or no pact, India will not attack Pakista
 n" were 
 well received in Pakistan and other countries. Prime Minister's offer of a Frie
 ndship 
 Treaty with Pakistan was an important event. The positive atmosphere in India- 
 
 Pakistan relations created by the discussions between the two Foreign Ministers
  in 
 January was unhappily vitiated by Pakistan's attempt to raise the Kashmir issue
  in the 
 UN Human Rights Commission, contrary to the principle of bilateralism enshrined
  in 
 the Simla Agreement. The visit of the Foreign Secretary, Shri R.D. Sathe, to Is
 lama- 
 bad, scheduled for early March, had to be deferred. 
  
  <br><br> India has followed an approach of good neighbourly relations and mutuality of
  
 interests with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma and Bhutan. The Bangladesh 
 
 Foreign Minister paid a vist to New Delhi in September 1981. India is committed
  to 
 search through dialogue acceptable solutions to all outstanding issues between 
 India 
 and Bangladesh. The President, Shri Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, visited Sri Lanka in 
 Feb- 
 ruary 1982. The visit strengthened the traditionally close relations between In
 dia and 
 Sri Lanka. Earlier in December 1981, the President paid a State visit to Nepal 
 which 
 further cemented the bonds of friendship and cooperation existing between the t
 wo 
 countries. The President's visit was preceded by the visit of the Minister of E
 xternal 
 Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, who, apart from holding discussion on issues 
 of mutual 
 interest, also visited certain development projects. India's continuing interes
 t in friendly 
 relations with Burma was manifested by Shri Narasimha Rao's visit to Rangoon. 
 
  
   <br><br>Government have continued their efforts to further normalise relations with C
 hina. 
 During the visit of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Huang Hua, to India, wide
 -ranging 
  <br><br>
                               (v) <br><br>
  
 discussions were held. It also resulted in agreement that the boundary question
  was 
 central to the relationship, and an early settlement was desirable. An official
  delega- 
 tion visited Beijing in December 1981 to discuss this question and other aspect
 s of bila- 
 teral relations. It is our hope that this dialogue will lead to the settlement 
 of all out- 
 standing problems which will enable full normalisation and further improvement 
 of 
 relations between our two countries. 
  
  <br><br> Relations with Japan, DPRK, ROK and Mongolia were further consolidated 
 during the year. 
  
  <br><br> In the context of India's abiding interest in regional stability and progress
 , steps 
 taken in regard to regional cooperation in South Asia have great relevance. Ind
 ia parti- 
 cipated actively at the Colombo and Kathmandu meetings where Foreign Secretarie
 s 
 of seven South Asia countries adopted ground rules for regional cooperation, de
 fined 
 its objectives and identified important areas of cooperation. 
  
   In pursuance of the decision of the New Delhi Conference of Non-Aligned Forei
 gn 
 Ministers, India played an active role, along with Zambia, Cuba and the PLO to 
 bring 
 about an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict. Though this objective is yet to be achi
 eved, India 
 has worked towards the formulation of some concrete suggestions which could for
 m 
 the basis of a just, peaceful and equitable solution to the problem. 
  
   Similarly, in regard to Afghanistan India has, from the very beginning, calle
 d for 
 a political settlement through negotiations among the parties concerned on the 
 basis of 
 withdrawal of foreign troops, stoppage of all forms of outside interference and
  the pre- 
 servation of the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-align
 ed status 
 of Afghanistan. This approach to the problem has come to be widely recognized a
 s 
 the only way out of the present situation in Afghanistan. 
  
   <br><br>The deterioration of the international situation as a result of the sharpenin
 g of 
 great power competition, referred to earlier, manifested itself most acutely an
 d drama- 
 tically in the Indian Ocean and its littoral States. The United States has main
 tained its 
 substantial naval presence in the Indian Ocean and augmented its forces in othe
 r ports, 
 including the conversion of Diego Garcia into a major naval base. The USSR, Fra
 nce, 
 and Britain stepped up their presences in the region. 
  <br><br>
   India has consistently maintained that this situation in the Indian Ocean has
  a de- 
 stablising effect and that the presence of one power is bound to attract other 
 great powers, 
 thereby creating a climate of confrontation. Although various grounds, such as 
 
 assurances of continued oil supplies, maintenance of communications, security a
 nd 
 regional stability, have been advanced to justify big power military presence i
 n the Indian 
 Ocean, it is our firm belief that this approach cannot contribute either to sec
 urity or 
 stability of the region. On the contrary, it tends to aggravate these problems.
  India 
 and other littoral States of the Indian Ocean have been deeply concerned at the
  growing 
 build up in this area and have repeatedly called for the Indian Ocean to be tur
 ned into 
 a Zone of Peace. We continued with our efforts to promote an early convening of
  a 
 conference of the concerned States in Colombo as a step towards demilitarizatio
 n of the 
 Indian Ocean. This has not materialised in 1981, as originally scheduled. 
  
      <br><br>                         (vi) <br><br>
  
   India believes that total nuclear disarmament has become a most urgent task i
 n 
 view of the perils facing mankind from an escalating nuclear arms race. Lasting
  peace 
 cannot be built on the fear of nuclear weapons but must rest on the foundations
  of a 
 general and complete disarmament under effective international control. To be m
 ean- 
 ingful, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons must cover both horizontal and ver
 tical 
 proliferation. Any discriminatory approach to this question is not only unjust 
 but also 
 unworkable. We have given expression to these views at the United Nations and o
 ther 
 international forums on disarmament. It is hoped that the second special sessio
 n on 
 disarmament will be able to give concrete shape to these objectives. 
 <br><br> 
   India continued to attach great importance to developments in West Asia and 
 
 improvement of our relations with the countries of the region. Apart from parti
 cipating 
 in the Non-Aligned Ministerial Committee on the Iran-Iraq conflict, India conti
 nued its 
 individual efforts to defuse the crisis. We strongly condemned the Israeli atta
 ck on 
 Iraq's nuclear reactor as "stark adventurism, blatant intervention and aggressi
 on". 
 Israel's highly provocative and aggressive act of annexing the occupied territo
 ry of 
 Golan Heights was equally strongly condemned by India. Our consistent and princ
 i- 
 pled support for the Arabs in general and the Palestinians in particular receiv
 ed 
 favourable notice and appreciation. India's traditionally close relations with 
 Egypt 
 were reconfirmed when President Hosni Mubarak, on assumption of his office foll
 owing 
 the assassination of the late President Sadat, chose India as the first country
  to send his 
 Minister of State for Foreign Affairs with a special message. Prime Minister Sh
 rimati 
 Indira Gandhi's visit to Kuwait and the UAE further promoted India's economic r
 ela- 
 tions with the Arab world and these two countries in particular. 
  
 <br><br>  India consolidated its traditional links with the Countries of South-East Asi
 a with 
 the exchange of highlevel visits during which a number of steps were taken to f
 orge closer 
 relations with them in all fields including economic and technical cooperation.
  Concrete 
 shape has been given to this cooperation with all the countries of South-East A
 sia, and will 
 be intensified in future. The Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi's visit to
  Indonesia, 
 Fiji, Tonga, Australia, and the Philippines in September-October, after more th
 an a 
 decade, contributed significantly to this objective. Foreign Minister Shri P.V.
  Narasimha 
 Rao paid visits to Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. India did not participate in
  the 
 international conference on Kampuchea because all the countries of the region h
 ad not 
 accepted the UN Resolution which formed the basis on which the conference had b
 een 
 convened. India felt that a conference, which accorded recognition to the inhum
 an, 
 discredited, Pol Pot regime, would hardly enhance the prospects of normalisatio
 n within 
 that country. India as a friend of all the parties has been kept fully informed
  of recent 
 developments. Our discussions have reinforced our view that solutions for the p
 ro- 
 blems of the region can best be found through a dialogue among the countries of
  the 
 region. 
  
 <br><br>  India reiterated her total and consistent support to the freedom struggle in 
 South 
 Africa and strongly condemned the manoeuvres of the country's racist regime not
  only 
 to stall the UN Plan for Namibia's independence but also to destablise the fron
 tline 
 States. While expressing its solidarity with Namibia and the frontline States, 
 India 
 also demonstrated its persistent interest in the economic development of Africa
 n States. 
  
                  <br><br>             (vii) 
  
 <br><br>Several agreements on technical and economic cooperation were signed with these
  dur- 
 ing the high level visits exchanged during the year. 
  
   Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi's visit to France, Italy and Switzerla
 nd 
 and her exchange of views with the leaders of these countries contributed great
 ly to a 
 better understanding of India's stand on various international issues. It also 
 helped 
 consolidate India's bilateral economic relations with these and other West Euro
 pean 
 countries. The arrangements for economic cooperation, concluded with France, in
  parti- 
 cular, which underscore the latter's readiness to render unfettered assistance 
 in India's 
 economic development, serve as a model of the type of cooperation that could be
  forged 
 between developed and developing countries. The high point of our intellectual 
 and 
 cultural contact with Europe is the Festival of India in London inaugurated by 
 the Prime 
 Minister during her official visit to the United Kingdom in March. India's trad
 itionally 
 close ties with East European nations continued apace and were further strength
 ened 
 during the Prime Minister's visit to Bulgaria and Romania during the year. 
  
   With regard to the situation in Poland, India has made it clear that India ha
 s always 
 been and remains opposed to all forms of outside interference in the domestic a
 ffairs of 
 any country. We are convinced that the problems in Poland can be solved by the 
 
 people of that country. 
  
  <br><br> As in the past, the Soviet Union showed understanding of the independent poli
 cy 
 pursued by India, particularly its adherence to non-alignment. The record of fr
 iend- 
 ship between India and the Soviet Union, despite differences in their political
  systems, 
 has proved the value of peaceful co-existence and cooperation among countries. 
 The 
 growing technical and scientific cooperation between the two countries was furt
 her de- 
 monstrated during the year by the launching of the second Indian satellite from
  a Soviet 
 cosmodrome and by the establishment of a troposcatter link between India and th
 e Soviet 
 Union. 
  
  <br><br> Since the assumption of office by the new US Administration, India has endea-
  
 voured to establish better mutual understanding and appreciation between the tw
 o 
 countries, specially in view of the differences in perception of the two Govern
 ments 
 on certain regional and global issues. The meeting between our Prime Minister a
 nd 
 the US President at Cancun, as also between our Minister of External Affairs an
 d US 
 Secretary of State, contributed to this process. However, the decision of the R
 eagan 
 Administration to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan has aroused widespread 
 appre- 
 hension and concern in India over US attitude to peace and stability in the sub
 -continent. 
 Another area of disagreement with the USA was the American decision to suspend 
 
 further shipments of fuel for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station. 
   India continued to develop meaningful, cooperation with the countries of Lati
 n 
 America and the Caribbean. The Prime Minister's visit to Mexico for the North-S
 outh 
 Summit facilitated meetings with several Heads of State in this region and furt
 her 
 consolidated India's economic relations with these countries. India's friendly 
 relations 
 and close cooperation with Canada continued. 
  
                     <br><br>          (viii) 
  
<br><br>   Three summit level conferences, having a bearing on the on-going negotiations
  for 
 a New International Economic Order, took place in Ottawa, Melbourne and Cancun.
  
 Before and during the Ottawa Summit of the major industrialized countries, held
  in July, 
 India made strenuous efforts at high-level for a constructive approach to the e
 nsuing 
 Cancun Summit of the rich and poor nations. Again, at the Melbourne meeting of 
 the 
 Commonwealth Heads of State/Government, India attempted to establish areas of 
 
 understanding with both the developing and developed member-States of the Com- 
 
 monwealth in the context of the Cancun Summit. At Cancun, the Indian delegation
 , 
 led by Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi, actively engaged itself in ensuri
 ng proper 
 understanding of the realities of inter-dependence. The door was thus left open
  for 
 further global negotiations though there was no specific commitment towards thi
 s end 
 on the part of the rich nations. As a follow-up in this direction, India took t
 he initia- 
 tive to convene a high-level South-South Conference of 44 developing countries 
 with a 
 view to evolving a strategy for greater cooperation among them and as a step to
 wards the 
 initiation of a dialogue on the new international economic order. The tone of t
 hese 
 consultations was set by the Prime Minister's nine-point inaugural address for 
 making 
 international cooperation more effective. Our initiative was welcomed by the pa
 rtici- 
 pants. India holds the view that collective self-reliance among developing coun
 tries 
 is an important factor in the progress towards North-South cooperation. 
  
   Alongside such multilateral activities, India pursued its economic and techni
 cal 
 cooperation on a bilateral plane with greater vigour during the year. The activ
 ities of 
 the various Joint Commissions already established were stepped up. By far the m
 ost 
 significant interaction in this direction was with African countries with many 
 of whom 
 economic cooperation agreements were signed and in some cases joint commissions
  
 set up. 
  
  <br><br> As an important instrument for promoting international understanding and har-
  
 mony, the Ministry gave due importance to cultural interaction. It organized ex
 change 
 visits of eminent personalities in various fields of specialization, delegation
 s of perform- 
 ing arts, exhibitions, essay competitions, film shows, etc. 
  
   On the other hand, as India's interaction with other countries increased in d
 iverse 
 fields of activities, ranging from economic and technical cooperation to supply
  of man- 
 power, the Ministry and its regional offices provided greatly enhanced passport
  and con- 
 sular services to our nationals going abroad. Procedures were streamlined and t
 he 
 facilities created to give greater satisfaction to Indian nationals as well as 
 foreign con- 
 tracting parties wherever involved. 
  
  <br><br> Compulsions of ever-increasing and complex international activities and trend
 s 
 have, in turn, necessitated administrative streamlining and reform so as to ena
 ble the 
 personnel of this Ministry to be equipped and prepared to respond to these new 
 challen- 
 ges and situations in good measure. The Government in the Ministry of External 
 
 Affairs and its offices in the country and our Missions abroad pursued with vig
 our and 
 dedication India's policies abroad. 
  
           <br><br>                    (ix) 
  
  <br><br> The coming year promises to be a period of both challenge and opportunity. Th
 e 
 principal task of our foreign policy, as before, will be to promote our ideals 
 and preserve 
 our interests in a rapidly changing international environment. Among the other 
 impor- 
 tant items on the agenda are strengthening the Non-Aligned Movement, disarmamen
 t, 
 elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism and racialism and the struggle 
 for a New 
 International Economic Order. India will actively participate in the work of th
 e 
 forthcoming summit meeting of non-aligned nations. The special session of the U
 nited 
 Nations General Assembly on Disarmament provides another opportunity to reverse
  
 the current alarming trends in the arms race. The continuing obstacles in secur
 ing the 
 independence of Namibia is a reminder that liberation of Africa is still incomp
 lete and 
 must be accelerated. We also intend to step up our efforts towards global negot
 iations.

<br><br> CHAPTER I 
  
 <br><br>INDIA'S NEIGHBOURS 
  
 <br><br>  India endeavoured its utmost to assist in the political settlement of the Afg
 han 
 problem on the basis of the preservation of independence, sovereignty, territor
 ial inte- 
 grity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan. India believes that a stable, non-
 aligned 
 Afghanistan is an imperative for the maintenance of South Asia as an area of pe
 ace, 
 free from external pulls and pressures. 
  
   India's stand on the situation concerning Afghanistan was guided by the follo
 wing 
 principles: 
  
   <br><br>(i) opposition to all forms of external interference or intervention in the d
 omestic 
       affairs of the countries of the region; 
 <br><br> (ii) opposition to the extension of the quarrels of other countries and the in
 duc- 
       tion of cold-war tensions into the region; 
 <br><br>(iii) respect for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the 
 non- 
       aligned status of the countries of the region; and 
 <br><br> (iv) preference for a negotiated political solution of problems through dialog
 ue 
       among the parties concerned. 
  
   Though there were occasional signs of flexibility in the policies and pronoun
 ce- 
 ments of the countries involved, no substantive progress was made. 
  
   Effective projection of India's views on the Afghan situation at various inte
 rna- 
 tional and bilateral forums, has resulted in a greater appreciation of its posi
 tion on 
 the question. 
  
   A commonly shared heritage formed the backdrop against which India and Bangla
 - 
 desh sought a further consolidation of their relations. As could be expected be
 tween 
 friendly neighbours, the two countries shared many view points, more so, as mem
 bers 
 of the Non-Aligned Movement. As in the past, in the period under report as well
 , a 
 spirit of conciliation and mutual accommodation informed their relations, even 
 in the 
 matter of dealing with the yet unresolved issues such as the implementation of 
 the Land 
 Boundary Agreement, illegal movement across the border, sharing of Ganga waters
  
 and the maritime boundary. An example of this was the approach of the two sides
  
 to the implementation of the Indo-Bangladesh Agreement of 1977, oil the Sharing
  of 
 Ganga Waters at Farakka and Augmenting its Flows. Despite the failure to reach 
 a 
 mutually satisfactory solution, it was decided at the ministerial review held i
 n April 
 1981, to take "appropriate and adequate measures" at a "high political level", 
 to reach 
 an understanding. 
  
                    <br><br>           pg2 <br><br>
  
   Over and above the use of diplomatic channels, Indo-Bangladesh consultations 
 
 and discussions were also carried out during the exchange of visits. The visit 
 of the 
 Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao to Bangladesh, in August 
 1980, 
 had set the pace for such high level exchanges. This was followed by the visit 
 of the 
 Bangladesh Foreign Minister to India last September. There was a reiteration of
  the 
 earlier commitment by the two Governments to continue the dialogue, and to sear
 ch for 
 mutually acceptable solutions to yet unresolved issues. Earlier, in February 19
 81, 
 the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh had visited New Dew in connection with the N
 on- 
 Aligned Foreign Ministers' Conference, when he had called on the President, the
  Prime 
 Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. 
  
  <br><br> The tempo of these useful Indo-Bangladesh exchanges was maintained at the lev
 el 
 of senior officials of the two countries. Secretary in the Ministry, Shri Eric 
 Gonsalves, 
 visited Dacca in November, to discuss the terms and conditions of lease-in-perp
 etuity, 
 of an area at Tin Bigha. The occasion of the return visit by the Bangladesh For
 eign 
 Secretary in January 1982, was availed of by the two sides to discuss the issue
  relating 
 to New Moore Island, the delimitation of the maritime boundary and the lease te
 rms of 
 Tin Bigha. 
  
 <br><br>  In the field of commercial relations, a significant event was the organisatio
 n of an 
 Indian Engineering Trade Fair at Dacca, in March 1981, by the Association of th
 e Indian 
 Engineering Industries in cooperation with the Indian High Commission. The Mini
 ster 
 of State for Commerce, visited Bangladesh in connection with the Fair. 
  
   As a result of increased trade and commercial contacts between India and Bang
 la- 
 desh, the need was felt for an improvement in the telecommunication links betwe
 en the 
 two countries. A Telecommunications Agreement was signed in May, during the vis
 it 
 of the Minister of Communications to Dacca. 
  
  <br><br> In the field of Indo-Bangladesh technical cooperation, a Memorandum of Under-
  
 standing on Technical Assistance was signed in December, for providing an assis
 tance 
 of about Rs. 60 lakhs to Bangladesh, for the preparation of project reports, fe
 asibility 
 studies, exchange of experts and provision of training facilities. 
  
   A Bangladesh Parliamentary delegation, led by the Speaker, Mr. Mirza Gholam 
 
 Hafiz, visited India in December, at the invitation of the Speaker of the Lok S
 abha and 
 the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. 
  
  <br><br> The year under review saw the unremitting efforts of the Government of India 
 to 
 improve and stabilise relations with Pakistan. Apart from the public statements
  to 
 that effect, the Prime Minister, in a letter to President Zia of Pakistan, reit
 erated her 
 personal commitment, as well as that of the Government and the people of India,
  to 
 respect the territorial integrity, national unity, political independence and s
 overeign 
 equality of Pakistan. The letter emphasised that, as the interests of India and
  Pakistan 
 are complementary, the building of harmonious relationships between the two cou
 ntries 
 would benefit the peoples of India and Pakistan and contribute towards peace an
 d sta- 
 bility in the sub-continent. 
  
                               <br><br> pg3 <br><br> 
  
   It was in furtherance of this policy, that the Minister of External Affairs h
 ad visited 
 Pakistan, in June. This occasion was availed of to convey, again, to the people
  of Pakis- 
 tan, India's sincere desire to improve bilateral relations. In view of the seri
 ous concern 
 which Pakistan's move had caused in India, the President and the Foreign Minist
 er of 
 Pakistan sought to justify the grounds on which Pakistan had entered into a sec
 urity 
 relationship with the USA and its decision to accept the offer of US arms suppl
 ies. The 
 Minister of External Affairs, while conceding the right of every country to acq
 uire arms 
 for self-defence, conveyed, in no uncertain terms, India's grave concern over P
 akistan's 
 intention to acquire highly sophisticated weapons and offensive aircraft such a
 s F-16 
 which would introduce, for the first time, a new level of military sophisticati
 on into 
 the region thereby heightening tension and triggering off an arms race. India's
  belief 
 in peace and friendship was embodied in the joint statement issued on 10 June, 
 which 
 declared that "strengthening of friendship between India and Pakistan served th
 e inte- 
 rests of both peoples and was indeed a geopolitical imperative." In view of Ind
 ia's 
 justified disquiet over the possibility of the new cold war vitiating Indo-Paki
 stan relations, 
 the joint press statement noted that "the Simla Agreement rules out the use of 
 force or 
 the threat of use of force between the two countries and provides for peaceful 
 settlement 
 of issues." <br><br>
  
   Pakistan's anxiety to acquire the most lethal weapons of war far beyond its g
 enuine 
 security needs and in the shortest possible time, seemed totally at variance wi
 th the spirit 
 of the Indo-Pakistani joint communique issued during the Minister's visit. This
  latest 
 US military aid to Pakistan is bound to raise the threshold of confrontation in
  South 
 Asia and to have a negative impact on the security environment of the region. 
 
 <br><br> 
   Even though Pakistan's proposal for a no-war pact came in the specific contex
 t of 
 its massive arms purchase from the U.S., India's response was positive. Initial
 ly, the 
 proposal, if it could be called one at that time, figured in a Pakistan Governm
 ent state- 
 ment of 15 September, issued in the context of the U.S.-Pakistan arms deal. Whe
 n, 
 on 22 November, the Pakistan Government forwarded an official note suggesting c
 on- 
 sultations on this subject, the Minister of External Affairs, in a clear and fo
 rthright state- 
 ment to both Houses of Parliament on 25 November, reacted positively and said, 
 "we 
 are committed to normalisation of relations with Pakistan as laid down in the S
 imla 
 Agreement. That means that we settle all our problems by direct bilateral discu
 ssions 
 without involving third parties". 
  
  <br><br> The Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Agha Shahi, visited New Delhi from  �,
  19820129 Mi,  
 ster of Pakistan, Mr. Agha Shahi, visited New Delhi from @@19to 1 February 1982
  to continue the dialogue on matters of mutual interest to 
 India and Pakistan. The proposal for the conclusion of an agreement on non-aggr
 es- 
 sion and non-use of force between India and Pakistan was discussed by the two F
 oreign 
 Ministers. As a result of the exchange of views, the air was sufficiently clear
 ed to faci- 
 litate specific consideration of the elements which could constitute the substa
 nce of such 
 an agreement. Besides, the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, gave the ass
 urance 
 that, pact or no pact, India would never attack Pakistan. She also proposed the
  estab- 
 lishment of a Joint Commission to go into various bilateral issues. The Pakista
 n side 
 welcomed this proposal. It was decided that an Indian official team would go to
  
 Islamabad before the end of February 1982 to continue the dialogue. 
  
                   <br><br> pg4   <br><br> 
  
   A negative aspect of Indo-Pakistan relations has been the false, and at times
 , 
 irresponsible coverage given to India in the government-controlled Pakistan med
 ia, 
 particularly the press. The Prime Minister and her family were special targets 
 of mali- 
 cious items and stories in the Pakistan press. The Government of India has inva
 riably 
 been protesting about this malicious anti-India tirade in the Pakistan media, f
 r om time 
 to time. <br><br>
  
   Despite these negative factors, India has been making every effort to explore
  con- 
 crete areas of cooperation with Pakistan. These included visits of pilgrims, sp
 orts and 
 cultural exchanges, and trade and commerce. Pakistan participated in the India 
 Inter- 
 national Trade Fair in November-December. 
  
 <br><br>  Another positive factor in Indo-Pak relations, was the promptness with which 
 
 the Pakistan authorities acted, in arresting the hijackers of an Indian Airline
 s aircraft, 
 on its flight from NewDelhi to Lahore, on 29 September. The Government of Pakis
 tan 
 has been requested to return the hijackers to the Indian authorities, but so fa
 r, it has not 
 been done in spite of the Pakistan President's assurance on it. 
  
   With Bhutan, India's relations have always been characterised by mutual trust
  
 and goodwill. On important regional and international issues, India and Bhutan 
 have 
 similar perceptions. As in the past, the two countries continued to work togeth
 er for 
 peace and stability in South Asia and for the economic regeneration of the less
  developed 
 countries, through the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations. 
  
  <br><br> During the year under review the Foreign Minister of Bhutan, Mr. Lyonpo Dawa 
 
 Tshering, visited India in May, while the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.
 V. Nara- 
 simha Rao, paid a goodwill visit to Thimpu in June. 
  
   From the beginning, India has been able to play a significant role in the eco
 nomic 
 development of Bhutan. Indian assistance todate, has been of the order of nearl
 y 
 Rs.150 crores. In recent discussions relating to Bhutan's Fifth Development Pla
 n, the 
 Government of India has offered to provide assistance worth Rs. 139 crores duri
 ng 
 1981-87. 
  
  <br><br> In addition to Plan assistance, the Government of India is constructing a maj
 or 
 hydroelectric project at Chukha which is expected to be commissioned in 1984-85
  
 and which will produce 336 MW of power. This project is being financed by India
  on 
 a grant-cum-loan basis in the ratio of 60 and 40 per cent respectively. once co
 mpleted, 
 it will also supply electricity to the northeast region of India. 
  
  <br><br> A cement factory at Penden with an installed capacity of 300 tonnes per day, 
 or 
 1 lakh tonnes per annum, has been completed and gifted to the Government of Bhu
 tan, 
 by the Government of India. The factory has begun production and is already sup
 ply- 
 ing cement to the Indian-executed Chukha Hydel Project and to India's north-eas
 t 
 region. 
  
                               <br><br>  pg5   <br><br>
  
   A lift irrigation scheme at Gaylegphug in southern Bhutan, is nearing complet
 ion. 
 This has been executed as a turnkey project. The Indo-Bhutan microwave link is 
 pro- 
 gressing satisfactorily. In Bhutan's forthcoming Plan, India will undertake the
  black- 
 topping of Bhutan's major east-west highway. The setting up of a shortwave broa
 d- 
 casting station in Bhutan will also be executed in the Fifth Plan period. 
  
   An Indian team visited Bhutan and carried out a joint preliminary aerial reco
 n- 
 naissance of the Manas-Sankosh area. It was agreed to undertake a prefeasibilit
 y study 
 in January 1982. 
  
  <br><br> A decision was taken to set up a national airline for Bhutan, linking Paro wi
 th 
 Calcutta. The airline will be operated in technical and commercial collaboratio
 n with 
 the Indian Airlines. It is expected to commence operations in April/May 1982. 
 
  
   Apart from providing financial assistance to Bhutan's development plans, Indi
 a 
 provides technical assistance by sending on deputation, experts in agriculture 
 and fores- 
 try, industries, road building, minerals, geological explorations and communica
 tions. 
 This flow is complemented by the large number of Bhutanese students who receive
  
 higher education in India on scholarships. 
  
  <br><br> India had agreed to receive 1500 Tibetan refugees living in Bhutan. In the fi
 rst 
 phase, 772 Tibetans have already arrived and have been settled in the State of 
 Karna- 
 taka. The remaining 723 are to be settled in Dehra Dun. 
  
 <br><br>  India and Nepal continued their joint efforts for the creation of conditions 
 of 
 peace and harmony in South Asia, so vital for the economic progress of the area
 . The 
 commonality of outlook of the two countries on many political and socio-economi
 c 
 problems, based on centuries-old cultural ties and a time-tested friendship, en
 abled 
 them to surge ahead in the search for peace. Besides, their membership in impor
 tant 
 international forums like the Non-Aligned Movement, the UN, and the Group of 77
 , 
 led to the deepening of their cooperation. 
  
  <br><br> Economic cooperation continued to be a firm basis of Indo-Nepal relations. In
  
 the fields of management of water resources, flood forecasting and hydel power 
 genera- 
 tion, all of considerable importance to the two countries, their cooperation re
 gistered 
 noteworthy progress. The hydel project on the river Karnali at Chisapani in Nep
 al 
 will, on completion, have a generating capacity of 3600 MW, besides providing c
 onsi- 
 derable benefits by way of flood control and irrigation. In the field of flood 
 forecasting, 
 a draft agreement has been submitted by the Government of India to the Nepalese
  
 Government, for the setting up of hydrological and meteorological stations in t
 he catch- 
 ment areas of the principal common rivers of the two countries. These stations 
 would 
 provide invaluable assistance in the forecasting of the floods which ravage the
  down- 
 stream area of UP and Bihar. An updated report on the Kosi High Dam, at Barak- 
 
 shetra in Nepal was also submitted during the year for the approval of the Gove
 rnment 
 of Nepal. The Devighat hydel scheme estimated to cost Rs. 40 crores, and one of
  the 
 most important of the Indo-Nepalese projects, is expected to be fully commissio
 ned in 
  
                             <br><br>       pg6          <br><br> 
  
 1984. This Indian aided project when completed, would greatly alleviate the pow
 er 
 shortage in the Kathmandu valley. Preliminary ground-survey work is about to st
 art 
 on the Pancheswar Project on the Nepal-India border, for which an agreement had
  been 
 signed in October 1980. <br><br>
  
   Another important area of Indo-Nepal economic cooperation is the joint work 
 
 on the Central Sector of the highway which extends from Butwal in the east to N
 epal- 
 ganj in the west, a total length of 303 Kms. This road is intended to link up t
 he isolated 
 areas of western Nepal with the more heavily populated and commercially active 
 areas 
 of central and eastern Nepal. 
  
   New schemes, have been identified for Indian assistance to Nepal. These inclu
 de 
 the installation of iodized salt plants as an essential measure for goitre cont
 rol, and the 
 expansion of some of the hospitals. <br><br>
  
   The work of the Indo-Nepal Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee, went 
 apace. Its first meeting was held at New Delhi in November. It was agreed to se
 nd 
 Field Inspection Teams to the Indo-Nepal border areas at an early date to ident
 ify the 
 work required for the maintenance of the border arrangements. 
  
   <br><br>The State visit paid by President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy to Nepal, in December,
  
 and the earlier official visit by the Minister of External Affairs in May, epit
 omized the 
 high water-mark of the political and economic cooperation between the Governmen
 ts of 
 India and Nepal and the friendship between the people of the two countries. Dur
 ing 
 his visit, the Minister of the External Affairs visited some of the development
 al projects 
 undertaken in Nepal with Indian assistance and addressed an ex-servicemen's ral
 ly at 
 Pokhara. Yet another inportant visit to Nepal during the earlier part of the ye
 ar, was 
 that of the Minister of Energy, Shri Ghani Khan Choudhury, in connection with t
 he 
 inauguration ceremonies of the Devighat Hydro-Electric Project 
  
   <br><br>India's relations with Burma continued to be friendly and cordial during the 
 year. 
 To further expand these relations, the Minister of External Affairs visited Bur
 ma in 
 October, and held discussions with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister 
 of 
 Burma on regional and bilateral issues. Both sides agreed to further enlarge th
 e area 
 of bilateral cooperation. During the same month, an official commercial delegat
 ion 
 paid a visit to Burma and identified areas of possible further cooperation betw
 een the 
 two countries. 
  
  <br><br> The State visit of President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy to Sri Lanka in February 19
 82, 
 marked an important stage in the growth of friendship and cooperation between I
 ndia 
 and Sri Lanka. The President was the chief guest at the celebrations of the 34t
 h anni- 
 versary of Sri Lanka's independence. 
  
                              <br><br>        pg7<br><br>
  
   The visit, and the spontaneous warmth of the reception accorded to him, was e
 vi- 
 dence of the friendly feelings of the government and the people of Sri Lanka to
 wards 
 India, besides being a reaffirmation of the close historical and cultural ties 
 which bind 
 the two countries. 
  
  <br><br> There was also exchange of ministerial visits between the two countries. In J
 une, 
 the Speaker of the Lok Sabha led a Parliamentary delegation to Sri Lanka. 
  
   The problem of stateless persons of Indian origin in Sri Lanka has been large
 ly 
 solved through the implementation of the 1964 and 1974 Repatriation Agreements.
  <br><br>
 The Governments of India and Sri Lanka are in close touch in respect of the res
 idual 
 problem of statelessness. It is expected, that a comprehensive solution to the 
 problem 
 will be found on the basis of the voluntary choice of the persons concerned 
  
  <br><br> India and Maldives have progressed further towards closer political and econo
 mic 
 relations. In March, 1981, the Indian Minister of State for Commerce signed an 
 Indo- 
 Maldivian Trade Agreement in Male. Exchange of commodities under this Agreement
  
 has begun and it is expected that Indo-Maldivian Trade will grow considerably i
 n the 
 coming years. 
  
  <br><br> International Airports Authority of India has completed work on the Hulule 
 airport expansion project in Maldives and the newly expanded airport was inaugu
 rated 
 in November. 
  
  <br><br> Several requests for technical experts including teachers and doctors, were r
 eceiv- 
 ed and met, and places in Indian educational institutions were made available t
 o Mal- 
 divian students. 
  
  <br><br> Indo-Iranian relations remained friendly and cordial. The Minister of Externa
 l 
 Affairs visited Iran in April, May and August, as a member of the Non-Aligned M
 inis- 
 terial Committee consisting of the Foreign Ministers of Cuba, India, Zambia and
  the 
 head of the political department of PLO. The Committee was constituted by the 
 
 Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference held in New Delhi in February 1981, fo
 r 
 making every effort to put an end to the Iran-Iraq war, within the frame-work o
 f the 
 principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. Conscious of the dangers stemming from 
 
 these hostilities, India played an active role in peace-making efforts undertak
 en by the 
 Non-Aligned Ministerial Committee. Unfortunately, despite sincere, persistent a
 nd 
 conscientious efforts, the Committee has not yet succeeded in its goal of bring
 ing the 
 two sides to agree to any solution. 
  
  <br><br> An agricultural delegation from Iran visited India in May-June. The Minister 
 
 of Housing and Rural Development of Iran, Mr. Mohammed Shahab Gonabadi, 
 visited India in October. Wide ranging talks on industrial and economic coopera
 tion 
 between the two countries were then held. The Deputy Commerce Minister and 
 General Secretary of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines, Eng
 i- 
 neer A. N. S. Khamoshi, visited India in November.

 <br><br>CHAPTER II 
  
 <br><br>SOUTH-EAST ASIA 
  
  <br><br> During the year under review, India continued to follow its policy of improvi
 ng 
 and consolidating bilateral relations ith the countries of South-East Asia and 
 the 
 Pacific. The year, therefore, saw th exchange of a large number of important vi
 sits. 
  
  <br><br> As regards the outstanding Kampuchean issue, India did not participate in the
  
 International Conference on Kampuchea held in New York in July 1981. As expecte
 d, 
 the substantive resolution passed by the UN General Assembly was rejected by th
 e 
 countries of Indo-China. At the same time, India continued to view positively a
 ny 
 efforts made by the countries of South-East Asia to establish conditions of dur
 able peace 
 and cooperation in the region. 
  
  <br><br> The year saw an unprecedented number of high level visits between India and 
 
 Indonesia. These visits underlined the strong mutual desire to maintain and exp
 and. 
 the close and friendly relations between the two countries. The Prime Minister,
  Shrimati 
 Indira Gandhi, visited Indonesia in September. The President of India paid a St
 ate 
 visit in December. It will be recalled, that the Indonesian President had visit
 ed India in 
 1980. Other visits included those of the Minister of Commerce, in November, and
  of 
 the Chairman of the Trade Fair Authority of India in May. 
  <br><br>
   From Indonesia, the important visits to India were those of the Indonesian Fo
 reign 
 Minister, Dr. Mochtar Kusumatmadja, in September; of Mr. Radius Praviro, Minist
 er 
 of Trade and Cooperatives, in November, and an earlier visit in April by a Parl
 iamen- 
 tary delegation led by Mr. Kartidjo, Deputy Speaker of the Indonesian Parliamen
 t. 
  
  <br><br> India and Indonesia have a close identity of views on the need to evolve a ne
 w 
 international economic order. The two countries, therefore, took a number of st
 eps 
 to forge closer relations in the field of economic and technical cooperation. T
 he most 
 important of these was the awarding of a contract to the Project and Equipment 
 Cor- 
 poration of India, worth US $ 70 million, for the expansion of a cement plant i
 n Pedang. 
  
   <br><br>Ties of friendship and cooperation continued to inform Indo-Malaysian relatio
 ns. 
 The Minister of External Affairs visited Kuala Lumpur in October, and held disc
 ussions 
 with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and th
 e 
 Minister for Trade and Industry, of Malaysia. To take stock of the existing eco
 nomic 
 and technical cooperation between the two countries, and to work out a programm
 e for 
 the future, a delegation at officials' level, led by Secretary in the Ministry 
 of External 
  
                               <br><br>               pg9          <br><br>
  
 Affairs, Shri Eric Gonsalves, visited Malaysia in December, for the annual bila
 teral 
 talks and a meeting of the Joint Committee. Earlier, in April, the Minister of 
 Com- 
 merce, Shri Pranab Mukherjee had paid a visit to the country. 
  <br><br>
   The Vice-President of India, Shri Mohammed Hidayatullah, visited Singapore in
  
 October. Another important visit was that of the Minister of Industry, Shri N. 
 D. 
 Tiwari, in the same month. 
  
   <br><br>The visit of the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, to the Philippines i
 n 
 October, the first ever by an Indian Prime Minister, highlighted the importance
  attached 
 by India to South-East Asia. The Prime Minister had wide-ranging discussions wi
 th 
 President Marcos. As a result of this visit, and the discussion, it is expected
 , that there 
 will be a further expansion in India's economic cooperation with the Philippine
 s. 
  
  <br><br> A fairly large Thai, delegation, led by Prince Subhadra Diskul, President of 
 the 
 Siam Society and a noted authority of the history of art, visited India in Febr
 uary/ 
 March 1981. The Prince visited various sacred Buddhist places. Minister of Stat
 e 
 for Industry, Dr. Charanjit Chanana, visited Thailand in June. 
  
  <br><br> Economic cooperation continued to be an important basis of India's friendly 
 
 relations with the Indo-China States. The Vietnamese Vice-Foreign Minister, Mr.
  Vo 
 Dong Giang, and the Vice-Minister for Foreign Trade, Mr. Dinh Van Tram, visited
  
 India in August and November, respectively. 
  
  <br><br> An agreement for a loan of Rs.10 crores for the purchase of textiles by Vietn
 am 
 from India, was concluded in May. A large number of Vietnamese students are 
 receiving training in various disciplines in Indian institutions. 
  
  <br><br> The Foreign Minister of Kampuchea, Mr. Hun Sen, paid a visit to India in Augu
 st. 
 In pursuance of a decision to expand areas of economic cooperation between the 
 two 
 countries, an official team of experts, led by the former Agriculture Secretary
  and 
 Member, Planning Commission, Shri G. V. K. Rao, was sent to Kampuchea and the 
 
 other Indo-China States in January 1982. 
  
  <br><br> There was a large number of important visits from Australia to India during 
 
 the year under review: the Governor-General in May and August, on a private and
  
 transit visit respectively; the Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, in August; 
 and the 
 Ministers for Industrial Development and Energy, and of Immigration and Ethnic 
 
  
                            <br><br>               pg10        <br><br>
  
 Affairs in July and June respectively. The latter came as an emissary of the Au
 stralian 
 Prime Minister, to invite the Prime Minister of India to participate in the Com
 mon- 
 wealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne, which the Prime Minister and t
 he 
 Minister of External Affairs attended in September/October. 
  
   <br><br>Besides, an Australian Parliamentary delegation, the Chief of the Australian 
 Air 
 Force and the former Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Gough Whitlam, visited Indi
 a. 
  
   The thirteenth round of Indo-Australian bilateral talks at the level of offic
 ials 
 was held in New Delhi in November. 
  
  <br><br> In August, an agreement was signed between the civil aviation authorities of 
 
 India and Australia. It is expected, that this agreement will lead to an increa
 se in the 
 number of tourists from Australia. 
  
   <br><br>India's relations with New Zealand continued to be cordial. An agreement on 
 
 forestry, nursery and plantation projects was signed in March 1981. There were 
 con- 
 tacts in the field of sports. 
  
   The Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, paid a visit to Fiji, in Septembe
 r, 
 the first ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to that country. 
  
  <br><br> Shrimati Indira Gandhi was also the first Indian Head of Government to visit 
 
 Tonga, which she did in September. The tumultuous welcome accorded to the Prime
  
 Minister in both these countries, was indicative of their desire for closer rel
 ations with 
 India. 
  
  <br><br> The President of Nauru, Mr. Hammer DeRoburt visited Delhi in July. Apart 
 from technical discussions with the Minister of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertil
 isers, 
 Shri P. C. Sethi, he also exchanged views with the Prime Minister, Shrimati Ind
 ira 
 Gandhi.

  <br><br> In the year under review, the Government maintained its policy of seeking to 
 
 improve relations with China and to resolve outstanding problems on the basis o
 f 
 equality and reciprocity. 
  
  <br><br> The Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr. Huang Hua, visited India from 26 to 30 June
 . 
 The discussions during this visit covered international, regional and bilateral
  matters. 
 The talks disclosed agreement in some areas and difference of views in a number
  of 
 others. The free and frank exchange of views helped towards a better understand
 ing of 
 each other's positions, which would be conducive to improving the climate betwe
 en the 
 two countries. The Chinese side accepted that the settlement of the boundary pr
 oblem 
 was important and that this should be done early. It was agreed that officials 
 of the 
 two sides would meet in Beijing in the later part of the year, to discuss all b
 ilateral 
 matters including the boundary question. 
  
 <br><br>  Discussions were, accordingly, held in Beijing from 10 to 14 December, at the
  
 Secretary level. The boundary question, cultural exchanges and scientific, tech
 nical 
 and economic cooperation, were covered. The discussions on the boundary questio
 n 
 revealed that there continued to be wide differences between the two sides. Thi
 s had, 
 in fact, been anticipated by the Indian side, which, in any case, had not expec
 ted subs- 
 tantive progress in the first round, since this was the first time the subject 
 was being 
 discussed in more than 20 years. However, the holding of the meeting, the fact 
 that 
 there was a detailed exchange of views, and that this was done in a very friend
 ly and 
 cordial atmosphere, was a positive step. 
  
  <br><br> Bilateral exchanges were reviewed during both the above meetings, and India 
 
 agreed that they should progress in a graduated manner. Business delegations, s
 ports- 
 men, journalists, academics and intellectuals, and a number of groups sponsored
  by 
 various international organisations, have been among the visitors exchanged by 
 the 
 two countries. 
  
 <br><br>  A major event in India-China relation during the year was the meeting between
  
 the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, and the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhao Z
 iyang, 
 at Cancun, in October. There was a reiteration on both sides, of the desire to 
 improve 
 relations, while recognising that there are major problems to be resolved. Chin
 a voiced 
 a desire to work more closely with India on international economic matters, par
 ti- 
 cularly in relation to the North-South and South-South dialogues. 
  
<br><br>With Japan, the Government has continued, as in the past years, to maintain 
 
 good relations. Though the annual bilateral talks between the Foreign Ministers
  could 
  
                           <br><br>pg12<br><br>
  
 not conveniently be scheduled through the year, it is the policy of the Governm
 ent, 
 to sustain and intensify the dialogue with Japan on bilateral, regional and int
 ernational 
 questions. While recognising the differences of perception on some internationa
 l 
 issues, it is evident that both countries have an interest in the stability and
  security of 
 the region. 
  
<br><br>   Japan is a major trading partner of India and accounts for about 10% of the 
 
 total volume of India's foreign trade, though trade with India amounts to less 
 than 1% 
 of Japan's foreign trade. Two-way trade between India and Japan reached the lev
 el of 
 US $ 2 billion. It is the commercial and economic component which is predominan
 t 
 in Indo-Japanese bilateral relations. 
  
 <br><br>  A number of institutions have already been established to further cooperation
  
 through periodic meetings. One of them, the India-Japan Study Committee, met in
  
 Tokyo in March 1981, for detailed discussions oil international and bilateral i
 ssues. 
 The 14th joint meeting of the India-Japan Business Cooperation Committee attend
 ed 
 by leading businessmen and industrialists of both countries, was held in Tokyo 
 in 
 December. 
  
  <br><br> At the Aid India Consortium Meeting, the Government of Japan pledged assistan
 ce 
 of the value of about Rs. 110 crores to India during fiscal year 1981. 
  
   During the year under review, the Vice-President of India paid an unofficial 
 
 visit to Japan. He was received by the Crown Prince. The year also saw visits t
 o 
 Japan, by the Ministers of Finance, Shipping and Transport, Communications, and
  
 the Minister of State for Science and Technology and the Chief Minister of Guja
 rat. 
 Reciprocal visits from the Japanese side are anticipated. 
  
   At the Cancun Summit in October, the Prime Minister of India met the Prime 
 Minister of Japan and had a brief discussion on bilateral relations, regional q
 uestions 
 and the issues before the Cancun Summit. 
  
  <br><br> India maintained friendly relations with both the Republic of Korea (ROK) and
  
 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and adhered to the policy 
 favouring the peaceful reunification of Korea through direct bilateral negotiat
 ions 
 between the DPRK and the ROK without any outside interference. 
  
  <br><br> In India's relations with the Republic of Korea, the momentum of growth was 
 
 maintained particularly, in the trade and economic fields where potential areas
  of 
 growth have emerged. The Joint Business Council meeting of the Federation of In
 dian 
 Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and 
 Industry, which met in Seoul in February 1981, recommended that two-way trade s
 hould 
 expand rapidly and reach a target of US $ 1 billion within three to four years.
  
  
 <br><br>  The Minister of Commerce led a delegation to Seoul in July, and held detailed
  
 discussions with the concerned Ministers of the Government of Korea about stren
 gth- 
 ening and enlarging trade and economic relations. The Labour Minister of the 
  
                             <br><br>pg13<br><br>
  
 ROK, Mr. Kwon Choong Dong, visited India in December. The Minister of External 
 
 Affairs met the Foreign Minister of the ROK, in New York in September, and 
 discussed bilateral and other questions of interest to the two sides. 
  
   India's relations with the DPRK witnessed further growth during the year unde
 r 
 review. New areas of bilateral cooperation were identified. A DPRK Government 
 
 delegation led by Vice-Premier, Mr. So Gwan Hi, visited India in January/Februa
 ry 
 1981. A protocol on cooperation in agricultural and scientific research, and tr
 aining 
 of personnel, was signed. 
  
  <br><br> A DPRK Parliamentary delegation led by The Chairman of the Standing Commit- 
 
 tee of the Supreme People's Assembly, Mr. Hwang Jang Yop, visited India in June
 . 
 The Cultural Exchange Programme for 1981-82 between India and the DPRK, was 
 signed in Pyongyang in July. The Minister of Education, Shrimati Sheila Kaul, v
 isited 
 the DPRK in October. 
  
 <br><br>  India's relations with the Mongolian People's Republic (MPR) are characterise
 d 
 by friendship and understanding. A two-member delegation led by the Minister 
 of State for Supply and Rehabilitation, Shri Bhagwat Jha Azad, visited Mongolia
  in 
 July, to participate in the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the Mongolian Revo
 lution. 
  
  <br><br> The First Deputy Foreign Minister and Special Envoy of President Tsedenbal, 
 
 Mr. D. Yondon, visited India in September, and handed over to the Prime Ministe

 <br><br>CHAPTER IV 
  
 <br><br>WEST ASIA AND NORTH AFRICA 
  
 <br><br>  Against the backdrop of increasing turbulence and tension caused by Israeli a
 cts 
 of aggression and expansionism, the continuing Iraq-Iran conflict, the growing 
 involve- 
 ment of outside powers in the region and the sharpening intra-Arab differences,
  India 
 continued its policy of full support for the Arab cause and sought to further d
 eepen 
 bilateral relations with the countries in the region. 
  
   The Prime Minister's visits to Kuwait and the U.A. E. in May, reflected the i
 mpor- 
 tance India attached to the Arab world in general and to the Gulf in particular
 . Dis- 
 cussions held during these visits revealed a broad similarity of approach to th
 e prob- 
 lems of the region, particularly the danger posed by the presence of outside po
 wers in 
 the area. The warm and enthusiastic welcome accorded to the Prime Minister in t
 hese 
 countries reflected India's very good relations with them. At a meeting of the 
 Indian 
 Heads of Mission in the Gulf region, held at Dubai, the Prime Minister outlined
  fresh 
 policy guidelines for strengthening bilateral relations and promoting India's n
 ational 
 interests in the area. 
  
 <br><br>  Earlier, in April, the Amir of Bahrain paid a three day visit to India during
  which 
 an agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation was signed. The process of 
 
 strengthening relations with the Gulf countries continued at a satisfactory pac
 e through 
 a regular exchange of visits (U.A,E. Communications Minister to India in Decemb
 er; 
 Secretary in the Ministry, Shri Romesh Bhandari, to Oman in October etc). 
 <br><br> 
   Israel's acts of wanton aggression and belligerence surpassed all limits, whe
 n it 
 launched a major aerial attack on Southern Lebanon with PLO headquarters as its
  
 target. Further, it attacked and destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor in June, a
 nd more re- 
 cently, it passed legislation to annex the Golan Heights captured from Syria in
  1967. 
 On all these occasions, India strongly reaffirmed its unqualified condemnation 
 of Israeli 
 actions and policies. The Government of India labelled the Israeli attack on th
 e Iraqi 
 nuclear reactor as "stark adventurism and blatant intervention and aggression d
 eserving 
 condemnation". Speaking in Parliament in December, the Minister of External Aff
 airs 
 decried the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights as "highly provocative and 
 aggres- 
 sive, being a policy of conquest and confrontation which will further aggravate
  the al- 
 ready tense and indeed, volatile situation in West Asia". 
  
                           <br><br>pg15<br><br>
  
   The unfortunate conflict between Iraq and Iran continued unabated, endangerin
 g 
 regional peace and security and threatening the solidarity of the Non-Aligned M
 ove- 
 ment. Conscious of the dangers amanating from continuing hostilities, India pla
 yed 
 a vital role in the peace-making efforts undertaken by the Non-Aligned Minister
 ial 
 Committee. As noted elsewhere in this Report, although the committee could not 
 
 achieve the desired result of bringing the two sides to agree on a compromise s
 olution, 
 it made clear that its good offices continued to remain available to the two pa
 rties and 
 that it would be happy to resume its efforts whenever so desired by the parties
  concerned. 
  
  <br><br> In spite of the consequences of the conflict, India's economic relations with
  Iraq 
 continued to expand. Some Indian workers, who had left work on projects in the 
 initial 
 phase of hostilities, returned to Iraq and the Iraqi Government awarded a numbe
 r of 
 new contracts to Indian companies. This raised the total value of Indian projec
 ts 
 from Rs. 1800 crores at the end of 1980 to over Rs. 2500 crores by December 198
 1. 
 Through a continuing exchange of ministerial visits (the Minister of Petroleum,
  
 Shri P.C. Sethi, the Minister of Works and Housing, Shri Bhishma Narain Singh, 
 
 and the Minister of Energy, Shri Ghani Khan Choudhury), the two countries 
 stayed in close touch on all aspects of their relations. 
  
   Indo-Saudi relations received a major fillip by the visit of the Saudi Foreig
 n Minis- 
 ter, Prince Saud Al-Faisal, to Delhi in April. The two Governments undertook a 
 
 very useful and frank exchange of views on several subjects of bilateral intere
 st. An 
 Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed. It stipulated Inter al
 ia, 
 the setting up of a Joint Commission. The visit of Prince Talal, brother of Cro
 wn 
 Prince Fahd and the Special Envoy of the UNICEF, which came soon after the Prim
 e 
 Minister's meeting with Crown Prince Fahd at Cancun, consolidated the growing g
 ood- 
 will for India in Saudi Arabia. 
  
  <br><br> The Government of India's decision earlier to raise the PLO representation in
  
 India to Embassy status, and the invitation to Chairman Arafat to visit India, 
 and his 
 successful visit, had opened a new chapter in Indo-Arab relations. India contin
 ued 
 the policy of further cementing its friendly and cordial ties with PLO through 
 a fre- 
 quent exchange of views and visits. India's consistent and principled support f
 or the 
 Arabs, and the Palestinians in particular, received favourable notice. During a
  call 
 on the Prime Minister in December, Arab Amabassadors stationed in Delhi express
 ed 
 appreciation of India's support and friendship. 
  
  <br><br> The assassination of President Sadat which was a blow to Egypt and the region
  
 as a whole, also highlighted the precarious nature of the peace in West Asia. I
 ndia 
 was represented at the funeral by the speaker of Lok Sabha, Dr. Balram Jakhar. 
 The 
 new President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, chose India as the first country to send his 
 Minis- 
  
                             <br><br>pg16<br><br>
  
 ter of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Boutros Ghali, to deliver a special messa
 ge for the 
 Prime Minister. Dr. Ghali's visit enabled the two Governments to examine afresh
 , 
 ways and means to improve their relations. The visit of Secretary in the Minist
 ry, 
 Shri Romesh Bhandari, to Cairo in December carried this process further. 
  
  <br><br> A Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of Lok Sabha Dr. Balram Jakhar 
 
 visited Syria and Morocco in January 1982. 
  
  <br><br> The President of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Mr. Ali Nasser 
 Mohamed, accompanied by a high-level delegation, visited India in May. The visi
 t 
 gave an opportunity for reviewing and further expanding bilateral cooperation. 
 India 
 agreed to increase the quantum of technical assistance to the PDRY and, subsequ
 ently, 
 an agreement was also signed to grant Rs. one crore credit for development of i
 ndustry 
 in the PDRY. 
  
  <br><br> Indo-Algerian relations registered further progress and there were many usefu
 l 
 exchange of visits. The Algerian Minister of Planning visited India in May. An 
 
 Indian delegation headed by the Minister of State for Industry, Dr. Charanjit C
 hanana, 
 visited Algeria to further explore possibilities of Industrial cooperation. Alg
 eria's 
 Transport Minister came to India in October and signed two important agreements
  
 concerning cooperation in the fields of shipping and railways. Under the recent
 ly 
 signed agreement on technical and economic cooperation, the first meeting of th
 e 
 Joint Commission took place in January 1982. 
  
 <br><br>  Relations with Libya were further consolidated. India joined other non-aligne
 d coun- 
 tries in expressing understanding and support for Libya following the crisis ca
 used by 
 the shooting incident between US and Libyan fighter planes. Indo-Libyan economi
 c 
 cooperation strengthened further during the year. There are now more than 50,00
 0 
 Indian experts and workers employed in Libya. Contracts worth more than Rs. 3,0
 00 
 crores have so far been awarded to Indian companies by the Government of Libya.
  
  
   <br><br>There were two important visits from Morocco, namely of Mr. Ahmed Osman 
 a former Prime Minister, as the King's special envoy and the Minister of Commer
 ce 
 and Industry Mr. Azzeddine Guessous. The two countries signed a new Trade Agree
 - 
 ment and an Agreement on Technical and Economic Cooperation.

<br><br> AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA) 
  
   India continued to give moral and material support to the Southern African li
 bera- 
 tion movements in their fight against colonialism, racialism and apartheid. Bes
 ides 
 India's abhorrence for all forms of discrimination, support to African liberati
 on move- 
 ments and independent countries of that continent lies rooted in the strong his
 torical 
 and emotional links that bind India to Africa. The number of visits by the many
  heads 
 of state and government of African countries and other dignitaries to India dur
 ing the 
 year under review, and the visits paid by the President and the Prime Minister 
 of India, as 
 well as other Indian leaders to African countries not to mention the various ag
 reements 
 concluded, clearly indicated the strong bonds that exist between India and the 
 African 
 states. About 50 delegations from various Ministries/Dapartments/organisations 
 of 
 the Government of India and those of the governments the various African countr
 ies 
 exchanged visits for further expansion of bilateral relations in industrial tec
 hnical, and 
 other fields. Approximately 8000 African students continued to receive educatio
 n 
 in Indian Universities and institutions. Most of them were on self-financing ba
 sis, 
 and some of them were on various scholarship schemes funded by the Government o
 f 
 India/International bodies etc. A large number of Indian doctors, teachers, eng
 ineers, 
 technicians and accountants are working in African countries to assist them in 
 their 
 respective fields, 
  
  <br><br> India's boycott of the racist regime of South Africa remained complete. It ut
 ilised 
 the UN and other international forums to condemn South Africa's policies of rac
 ial 
 discrimination. It may be recalled that the New Delhi Declaration of the Foreig
 n 
 Ministers of Non-Aligned countries in February 1981 had reiterated India's cond
 emna- 
 tion of the apartheid system. The unprovoked aggression by the racist regime of
  
 South Africa against Angola and other Frontline States came in for strong conde
 mna- 
 tion by the Government of India. 
  
   In pursuance of the consistent policy of support to African freedom movements
 , 
 the South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO), the sole and authentic re
 - 
 presentative of the Namibian people, was granted facilities by the Government o
 f India 
 to set up a Resident Mission in New Delhi. It would be recalled, that a similar
  Mission 
 of the African National Congress (S.A.) was established in New Delhi in 1967 wi
 th 
 the Government of India's help. 
  
  <br><br> The friendly relations between India and Guinea were further strengthened wit
 h 
 the visit of President Sekou Toure from Mar 17, 1981 to 20 March, 1981. The Gov
 ernment of 
  
                             <br><br>pg18<br><br>
  
 Guinea sought India's expertise and technical cooperation in the fields of agri
 culture 
 and small scale industries. A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed 
 between the two countries in October/November 1981, at the end of a successful 
 
 visit to India by the Guinean Minister of Agriculture and Cooperation. 
  
  <br><br> India continued to maintain warm and cordial relations with Tanzania. The 
 Tanzanian President paid a State visit to India from 30 March to 3 April, 1981.
  India 
 agreed to participate in the development of sugar industry, creation of facilit
 ies for 
 technical education, development of ports and the establishment of cement indus
 try 
 in Tanzania. 
  
 <br><br>  Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe visited India in May. The visit 
 culminated in the signing of trade, cultural, technical and economic cooperatio
 n agree- 
 ments. India agreed to extend a credit of Rs. 5 crores to Zimbabwe. 
  
  <br><br> A new dimension to Indo-Zambian relations was added with the visit of Preside
 nt 
 Neelam Sanjiva Reddy to Zambia in June. During the President's visit, letters w
 ere 
 exchanged establishing an Indo-Zambian Joint Commission. A protocol on coopera-
  
 tion in the field of railways was also signed. 
  
  <br><br> The President of India paid a return visit to Kenya in the first week of June
 . 
 The visit provided an opportunity for exchange of views with the Government of 
 Kenya. 
 The President's visit was followed by Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi's o
 fficial 
 visit to Kenya from 9 to 12 August. She was accompanied by the Minister of Exte
 rnal 
 Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao. 
  
  <br><br> Cooperation between India and Nigeria in the ecnomic field progressed satis- 
 
 factorily. The Indo-Nigerian Joint Commission held its first session in New Del
 hi 
 in July. Time and again, the Nigerian leaders have expressed appreciation of th
 e per- 
 formance of Indian public sector enterprises such as the RITES Group attached t
 o

 d 
 Nigeria in May. 
  
  <br><br> India's friendly relations with Seychelles were renewed when the Prime Minist

 Kenya, met with the President of Seychelles and discussed international problem
 s and 
 matters of bilateral interest.

   The President of Botswana, Dr. Q. K. J. Masire, visited India in September. 
 
 During the visit, an agreement on secondment of personnel and a Memorandum of 
 
 Understanding for cooperation in the field of small scale industries were signe
 d. 
  
   Similarly, Indo-Madagascar relations, which have been expanding over the year

 s of co- 
 operation in the field of agriculture, small scale industries, etc. During the 
 Ghanaian 
 President's visit, agreements on Trade, culture, Economic and Technical Coopera

<br><br> EUROPE 
  
<br><br> WESTERN EUROPE 
  
  <br><br> With Western Europe which has emerged as an independent entity in world 
 affairs, India's relations continued to grow and develop. Important visits to a
 nd from 
 Western Europe helped to consolidate further these relations. During the year, 
 the 
 Prime Minister visited France, Italy and Switzerland. The Prime Minister of UK,
  
 and the King and Queen of Spain were the distinguished visitors from abroad. Th
 e 
 Minister of External Affairs paid visits to the UK and the FRG, and received th
 e Foreign 
 Ministers of France, Spain, Austria and Portugal. Besides, there were also inte
 nsive 
 contacts between India and the West European countries, in the cultural and sci
 en- 
 tific fields, both at the governmental and non-official levels. Joint Business 
 Councils 
 have been established between India and some of the countries of the area. Parl
 ia- 
 mentary delegations from a number of European countries, including a delegation
  
 from the European Parliament, visited India. 
  
  <br><br> Western Europe is the most important trading partner of India, and the ten EE
 C 
 countries account for almost 30% of India's total trade. During the year under 
 re- 
 view, Indo-EEC discussions on a new trade agreement were successfully concluded
  
 and a fresh Commercial and Economic Cooperation Agreement was signed in June. 
 
 The Vice-President of the EEC and Commissioner for External Relations Mr. Wilhe
 lm 
 Haferkamp visited India in January 1982 to participate in the first meeting of 
 the 
 Indo-EEC Joint Commission under the new Agreement. 
  
  <br><br> Western Europe continued to be an important source of development coopera- 
 tion assistance to India, both multilaterally and bilaterally. The West Europea
 n coun- 
 tries also accounted for a large proportion of the technical and financial inve
 stments 
 in India. The major donors were the UK, France, the FRG, the Netherlands, 
 Sweden, Denmark and Norway. India is one of the largest recipients of bilateral
  aid 
 from several of these countries. However, in the case of a few countries, there
  has been 
 a disquieting trend to offset a decrease in economic aid by seeking to promote 
 their 
 exports to India. 
  
   <br><br>The growing cooperation between India and France received a fillip, after the
  
 coming to power of the Socialist government of President Francois Mitterrand. T
 he 
 independent policies and attitudes of India and France brought them nearer to e
 ach 
 other, and seemed to provide a framework for closer consultations. 
  
                              <br><br>pg21<br><br>
  
   The Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, visited France in November. The 
 
 French Foreign Minister, Mr. Claude Cheysson, had visited India in August for 
 
 discussions with the Indian leaders. The President of France and the Prime Mini
 ster 
 of India issued a Joint Declaration on the International political and economic
  situa- 
 tion. It rejected "the conduct of international relations based on fear, domina
 nce 
 and arrogance", and stressed the duty of the international community to safegua
 rd 
 the independence of countries against foreign domination or external interventi
 on. 
  
   <br><br>Memoranda on Economic Cooperation, relating to coal, environment, power 
 and energy, were signed between the two countries. 
  
   While in Paris, the Prime Minister took the opportunity to convene a meeting 
 
 of the Heads of Indian Mission in West Europe. The state of India's relations w
 ith 
 Western Europe was broadly reviewed, and the Prime Minister issued guidelines f
 or 
 improving further, India's relations with the countries of this region. 
<br><br>  
   The Prime Minister's visit to Italy was the first ever by an Indian Prime Min
 ister 
 to that country. The Italian Government announced that in addition to the $20 m
 illion 
 government credit already committed further credits worth $ 50 million would be
  offer- 
 ed in each of the next two years. Technical assistance on a grant basis up to $
  10 
 million was also announced by the Italian side. Substantive discussions were he
 ld 
 between the two delegations on economic and political questions. 
  
  <br><br> The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, visited India in April 19
 81, 
 and had discussions with the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, on matters
  of 
 mutual interest to the two countries. Memoranda of Understanding were signed 
 on trade and certain industries, coal, power, science and technology and space.
  
  
   <br><br>In November, the Minister of External Affairs visited UK. He paid a courtesy 
 
 call on the British Prime Minister. He met the Home Secretary and the Foreign S
 ec- 
 retary. During the discussions with the Home Secretary, the Minister of Externa
 l 
 Affairs expressed the hope that the implementation of the Nationality Act and t
 he Con- 
 nected rules and regulations would ensure the existing rights of Indians settle
 d in UK. 
 He also reiterated the proposal that the number of vouchers for the UK Passport
  Holders 
 coming from East Africa should be raised, and special efforts made to prevent t
 he 
 members of families from being separated. 
  
 <br><br>  A Festival of India, a joint venture by India and the UK, will be inaugurated
  in 
 the UK by the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi in March 1982. 
  
   The Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, visited Bonn in 
 November to inaugurate a well-documented and well-attended exhibition on the 
 "Life and Time of Nehru". He addressed the Foreign Policy Association on "Non- 
 
  <br><br>pg22<br><br>
  
 Alignment Today". He emphasised the importance of non-alignment and the signi- 
 
 ficance of independent thinking by nations, for promoting peace and good relati
 ons 
 among the world community. During this stay, the Minister called on the FRG Pre
 - 
 sident, Mr. Carstens, and had consultations with the Foreign Minister, Mr. Gens
 cher. 
  
  <br><br> To honour the work and memory of the great Indologist, Prof. F. Max Mueller, 
 
 an important street in New Delhi was named as "Max Mueller Marg". The cere- 
 mony, held on 14 December, was attended by the Economics Minister of the FRG, 
 
 Count Lambsdorf, and the Minister of External Affairs, Shri Narasimha Rao. 
  
  <br><br> India continued to be the largest recipient of West German assistance, receiv
 ing 
 approximately Rs. 144 crores per year. The FRG's assistance to India is covered
  
 under broad heads such as debt relief, commodities, capital goods, development 
 banks, 
 projects and rural development programmes. West German investment in India is 
 
 also considerable and the FRG ranked third in technical collaboration with Indi
 a, 
 after the USA and the UK. 
  
 <br><br>  The Foreign Secretary of Denmark visited India in October and held cousulta- 
 
 tions with the Foreign Secretary, Shri R. D. Sathe. The Danish Foreign Secretar
 y 
 emphasised Denmark's role as a bridge between the EEC and the Nordic countries.
  
 Denmark is one of the few countries which has reached the goal or giving 1% of 
 its 
 GNP as assistance to the developing countries. 
  
  <br><br> Indo-Dutch relations in various fields continued to develop well. Efforts are
  
 continuing in both countries to follow up on the results of the important visit
  of Prince 
 Claus to India in February 1981. The Netherlands has a commendable record in de
 ve- 
 lopment cooperation. India was the largest recipient of Dutch economic assistan
 ce 
 and in 1980-81, received about Rs. 92 crores. 
  
   <br><br>The Portuguese Foreign Minister visited India in October/November, and had 
 consultations with the Minister of External Affairs. Both sides expressed the d
 esire to 
 develop closer relations in the years to come. The visiting Minister announced 
 the 
 Portuguese Government's decision to open a Cultural Centre in New Delhi. 
  
  <br><br> The Foreign Secretary, Shri R.D. Sathe, visited Spain in February 1981, to re
 turn 
 the visit of the Spanish Secretary of State to India last year. The King and th
 e Queen 
 of Spain, along with the Spanish Foreign Minister, paid a State visit to India 
 in January 
 1982. The King was the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations. He met the
  
 President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister. The Spanish Foreign Minis

 planning figures for grant assistance to India in 1981 were of the order of Rs.
  11 crores. 
 The Norwegian technical assistance programme has three main components: Project
  
 Assistance such as boat building programme, equipment for fishing etc.; Program
 me 
 Assistance including post-natal programme in the family welfare sector; and 
 Commodity Assistance such as fertilizers, paper etc. 
  
  <br><br> During the year, the Turkish Government and the people celebrated the 100th a
 nni- 
 versary of the birth of Kamal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. To mark th
 is 
 occasion, and to study the achievements of the two great modern and secular lea
 ders, 
 seminars were held on the life and work of Ataturk and Jawaharlal Nehru, in Del
 hi 
 and in Ankara. 
  
<br><br> THE USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE 
  
   <br><br>India's relations with the Soviet Union and other countries of Eastern Europe
  
 have been marked by cordiality and a frequent exchange of high level visits. Th
 e high- 
 lights of the year under review were the visits of the Prime Minister, Shrimati
  Indira 
 Gandhi, to Romania and Bulgaria, and that of the Minister of External Affairs t
 o the 
 Soviet Union. The economic exchanges were also more intense, and made notable 
 
 progress. 
  
  <br><br> The year witnessed an intensified exchange of economic delegations and consul
 - 
 tations between India and the Soviet Union. The Minister of External Affairs pa
 id a 
 one-day working visit to Moscow in July and had detailed discussions with the S
 oviet 
 Foreign Minister. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Firyubin, visited Ind
 ia in 
 August. Another important visit was that of the Soviet Vice-President, Mr. Kuzn
 etsov 
  
                            <br><br>pg24<br><br>
  
 who came here in December, at the head of a Parliamentary delegation. During hi
 s 
 stay in Delhi he had a wide exchange of views with Indian leaders, including ca
 lls on the 
 Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. He brought a message from 
 
 President Brezhnev for the Prime Minister, outlining the approach of the Soviet
  leader- 
 ship to current international issues, including President Brezhnev's discussion
 s with some 
 world leaders. 
  
   <br><br>Indo-USSR trade and economic relations expanded further during the period 
 under review, both sides working in close cooperation for realising the objecti
 ves set out 
 in the Long-term Programme of Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technical Coopera
 tion 
 of Mar 14, 1979. The overall trade turnover, as a result of the realisation of 
 the trade 
 plan targets, is expected to be about Rs. 2,200 to Rs. 2,400 crores this year m
 aking 
 the Soviet Union India's single biggest trading partner. 
  
  <br><br> The Indo-Soviet Planning Group had its fifth meeting in New Delhi in March 19
 81. 
  
   The Soviet Minister for Coal Industry and the Minister for Meat and Dairy Dev
 e- 
 lopment, visited India in April 1981. 
  
   The visit of the Soviet Minister for Oil Industry, in November was a very use
 ful 
 one. A protocol on further cooperation in this field, was signed which concreti
 ses 
 specific sectors in which the Soviet Union will assist India, and the areas whe
 re it would 
 undertake on-shore oil drilling operations. 
  
  <br><br> The Soviet Minister for Non-Ferrous Metallurgy visited India in January 1982,
  
 mainly to take part in the inaugural function of the Cold Rolling Mill of the B
 harat 
 Aluminium Company at Korba. This visit was also utilised by both sides to discu
 ss 
 measures to further expand cooperation between the two countries in the field o
 f non- 
 ferrous metallurgy, particularly relating to financial and technical aspects of
  the 
 projected alumina plant in Andhra Pradesh. 
  
  <br><br> The other important Soviet visitors to India were, the Soviet Army Chief, Mar
 shal 
 Ogarkov, and the Soviet Navy Chief, Admiral Gorshkov. 
  
  <br><br> The Ministers of Shipping and Transport, Energy, Commerce, Steel and Mines, 
 
 and Law, Justice and Company Affairs, visited the Soviet Union. The Minister of
  
 Supply and Rehabilitation, the Deputy Minister of Information and Broadcasting,
  and 
 the Chief Justice of India, were the other important dignitaries who visited th
 e 
 USSR. 
  
  <br><br> India also played host to a delegation led by the Vice-Chairman of the Suprem
 e 
 Soviet of the USSR and President of the Turkmenian S.S.R., Mr. Balli Yazkulier.
  
 The visit was in response to an invitation by the Friends of the Soviet Union a
 nd the 
 Indo-Soviet Cultural Society. 
  
   <br><br>Indo-Bulgarian relations received a fresh impetus with the visit of the Prime
  
 Minister to Bulgaria in November. Shrimati Indira Gandhi was received with grea
 t 
 warmth and enthusiasm both by the leadership and the people of that country. Sh
 e 
 had wide-ranging discussions with the Bulgarian President, Mr. Zhivkov, on bila
 teral 
  
                             <br><br>pg25<br><br>
  
 matters and current international issues. The Prime Minister's observations reg
 arding 
 the situation in South Asia were received with full understanding and support. 
 
  
  <br><br> The Prime Minister signed with President Zhivkov, a Joint Indo-Bulgarian Dec-
  
 laration, expressing the views of the two countries on major international and 
 bilateral 
 matters. 
  
   On the economic side, the two sides expressed their resolve to further expand
  co- 
 operation between the two countries corresponding to all possibilities offered 
 by the 
 economic, scientific and technological potential of the two countries on the ba
 sis of 
 planning, long-term stability, diversification and balanced growth. The new for
 ms of 
 cooperation including joint ventures as well as specific areas in which such jo
 int ventures 
 are possible, were discussed. Bulgarian officials noted with understanding Indi
 a's re- 
 quirements for petroleum products. They agreed that all efforts would be made t
 o 
 diversify imports from India, to include engineering items like textile machine
 ry, earth- 
 moving equipment, heavy-duty cranes, metallurgical equipment and electronic com
 po- 
 nents. 
  
 <br><br>  Apart from the Prime Minister's visit, several other bilateral visits took pl
 ace bet- 
 ween India and Bulgaria. The then Minister of Education, Shri S.B. Chavan; Mini
 ster 
 of State for Education, Culture and Social Welfare, Shrimati Shiela Kaul; and t
 he then 
 Deputy Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Kumari Kumudben Joshi, visite
 d 
 Bulgaria. During the last mentioned visit, a comprehensive programme on coopera
 tion 
 between Doordarshan and Bulgarian T.V. as well as All India Radio, and Bulgaria
 n 
 Radio, was signed. There were also visits by various parliamentary figures. 
  
 <br><br>  The Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Trade, Mr. Hristo Hristov, visited India in
  
 March 1981, and signed a Protocol for increasing trade exchanges between the tw
 o coun- 
 tries. The Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria, Mr. Georgi 
 
 Yordanov, came in December. Member of the Central Committee of the 
 Bulgarian Communist Party and Minister of National Education of the People's 
 Republic of Bulgaria, Prof. Alexender Fol visited India during January-February
  1982. 
 He held discussions with Indian academicians, for joint research on ancient Bul
 garian 
 and Indian culture. 
  
   <br><br>Indo-Romanian relations became closer as a result of the Prime Minister's vis
 it 
 to Romania in October. She was received with great cordiality, and her talks wi
 th 
 President Ceausescu were characterised by a close understanding of each other's
  posi- 
 tions on international issues. 
  
   <br><br>In the field of bilateral economic cooperation, the discussions at the offici
 al level 
 covered a broad spectrum, and areas of further growth and cooperation such as p
 etro- 
 chemicals, chemicals, oil exploration and ship building, were identified, keepi
 ng clearly 
 in view the country's economic requirements. The need for exporting more engine
 ering 
 goods from India to Romania for balancing bilateral trade, was emphasised. 
  
   There was a visit by a Romanian Parliamentary delegation to India, in May. 
 The delegation had meetings with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Chairman of 
 the 
  
                             <br><br>pg26<br><br>
  
 <br><br>Rajya Sabha, and the Minister of Commerce. Besides, normal economic and politic
 al 
 exchanges were continued. 
  
  <br><br> With Hungary, exchange of various political economic and cultural delegations
  
 took place. The Minister of State for Irrigation, paid a visit to Hungary in Ju
 ly, 
 and discussed matters concerning collaboration in water management. The Hungari
 an 
 Minister for Foreign Trade, came to India on an official visit in October, and 
 had dis- 
 cussions with the Ministers of Commerce and Steel and Mines. The Minister of St
 ate 
 for Education and Culture, was in Hungary in September, and had a meeting with 
 her 
 counterpart as well as with the Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister. 
  
   <br><br>The Indo-Czech Long-term Trade Plan for 1982-85, was signed in Prague in June
 . 
 This provides for the doubling of trade exchanges by the two countries by 1985,
  and for 
 a step-up in Indian exports of non-traditional items. The Czechoslovak Minister
  of 
 Metallurgy Mr. Eduard Saul, visited India in January 1982, to negotiate certain
  areas 
 of industrial collaboration. He called on the Prime Minister, and had detailed 
 discussions 
 with the Ministers of Industry, Steel and Mines. 
  
  <br><br> Indo-Yugoslav relations have always been close, and the two countries share m
 any 
 perspectives on international affairs. Yugoslavia's activity in non-aligned for
 ums pro- 
 vided many occasions for close cooperation. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister visit
 ed 
 India, as leader of the Yugoslav delegation to the Non-Aligned Foreign Minister
 s' 
 Conference in February 1981. He met the Minister of External Affairs and called
  on 
 the Prime Minister. An important visitor from Yugoslavia was, the Prime Ministe
 r 
 of the Serbian Republic Mr. Ivan Stambolic. He met the Prime Minister, and othe
 r 
 high Indian dignitaries. 
  
   The GDR Defence Minister, Gen. Heinz Hoffmann, was on an unofficial visit to 
 
 India in January 1982, during the course of which, he called on the Prime Minis
 ter, 
 and had an exchange of views on matters of mutual interest. He also handed over
  to 
 her, a message from the GDR President, Mr. Erich Honecker, outlining his percep
 tion 
 of a current international problems as well as an assessment of his discussions
  with 
 some world leaders. He also called on the Defence Minister and had discussions 
 with 
 other officials. 
  
   Trade and industrial cooperation between India and the GDR, progressed 
 further during the period under review. 
  
   Prime Minister Gen. Jaruzelski of Poland sent a message to the Prime Minister
 , 
 Shrimati Indira Gandhi, explaining internal developments in Poland. 
  
   Trade and economic cooperation between the two countries continued during the
  
 period under review. The Annual Trade Plan for 1982 has been finalised. India h
 as 
 extended to Poland, a technical credit of Rs. 18 crore valid upto June 1982, in
  addition to 
 a similar sum provided for, in the Annual Trade Plan.

 <br><br>CHAPTER VII 
  
 <br><br>THE AMERICAS 
  
<br><br> NORTH AMERICA 
  
  <br><br> The first year after the assumption of office by the new Administration in th
 e United 
 States witnessed serious effort by India to start a dialogue with it. This bila
 teral ex- 
 change of views acquired particular significance in view of the differences in 
 perception of 
 the two Governments on certain regional and global issues. However, despite the
 se dif- 
 ferences, India endeavoured to further strengthen mutually beneficial relations
  with the 
 United States, as it recognised that both countries had a stake in the stabilit
 y of the re- 
 gion in and around the Indian subcontinent. To this end, opportunities which co
 uld 
 lead to a better understanding of each other's positions on economic and politi
 cal ques- 
 tions were naturally welcomed by India. 
  
<br><br>   The meeting between the Prime Minister and the US President at the Cancun 
 Summit on the North-South dialogue, in October, was an important event in Indo-
 US 
 relations during the year. The discussion between the two leaders touched on th
 e 
 consequences of the US decision to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan. Both 
 before 
 and after the summit, the two leaders had exchanged correspondence relating to 
 matters 
 of mutual concern. 
  
  <br><br> Discussions were held between the Minister of External Affairs, Shri P.V. 
 Narasimha Rao, and the Secretary of State, Mr. Alexander Haig, when they met at
  
 Cancun in August 1981, at the preliminary talks before the summit on the North-
 South 
 dialogue. 
  
   <br><br>The two other notable visits to the USA were those of the Vice-President, Shr
 i 
 M. Hidayatullah, in October, and the Lok Sabha Speaker, Dr. Balram Jakhar, in 
 
 September. 
  
   From the United States, the Permanent US Representative to the United Nations
 , 
 Mrs. J. Kirkpatrick, visited India in August. She held talks with the Minister 
 of Exter- 
 nal Affairs, and called on the Prime Minister. The Counsellor in the State Depa
 rt- 
 ment, Mr. Robert McFarlane also visited India in September. A delegation led by
  
 Mr. Melvin Price, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Repr
 e- 
 sentatives, and another led by Representative Clarence Long, Chairman, Sub-Comm
 ittee 
 on Foreign Operations of the House of Representatives, visited India in January
  and 
 August 1981 respectively. 
  
  <br><br> The US decision to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan ostensibly as a reac
 tion 
 to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, aroused apprehensions in India. In t
 he past, 
 India had more than once been a victim of Pakistani aggression. The possibility
  of the 
  
                             <br><br>pg28<br><br>
  
 introduction of a new generation of armaments into the sub-continent, heightene
 d the 
 fears based on past experience. The concern of the Government of India about th
 e US 
 decision was, therefore, conveyed adequately to the United States at various le
 vels but 
 unfortunately without result. It was made clear, that while India had no object
 ion to 
 Pakistan acquiring armaments for defensive purposes, the nature of arms which t
 he 
 United States was considering supplying to Pakistan, was essentially offensive.
  The 
 US justification for its decision was, that Pakistan had now become a front-lin
 e State 
 against the Soviet Union, a dubious distinction, which Pakistan declined to acc
 ept 
 openly. The US Administration also argued, that the projected military assistan
 ce to 
 Pakistan would not upset the supposed superiority which India enjoyed in milita
 ry 
 terms over Pakistan. But it was pointed out to the United States, that such an 
 assess- 
 ment had no basis in reality since without the introduction of American arms in
 <br><br> the 
 region, Indian and Pakistani force levels on their Common frontier were approxi
 mately 
 at par in quantum as well as in terms of sophistication. The passage of the pro
 posals 
 on the security assistance to Pakistan through the US Congress which confirmed 
 the 
 Administration's decision, cast a shadow over bilateral relations which showed 
 no 
 signs of lifting at the year end. 
  
  <br><br> The other issue of controversy between India and the United States was the US
  
 decision to suspend shipments of fuel for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station in v
 iola- 
 tion of the 1963 Agreement between the two states. At the beginning of the year
 , India 
 formally asked the United States, for assurances of continued supply of fuel, w
 hich 
 however, were not forthcoming. At the initiative of the United States, three ro
 unds of 
 official level talks were held in April, July and November alternately at Washi
 ngton 
 and Delhi, in an attempt to resolve differences amicably and bring about if nec
 essary, 
 a mutually acceptable termination of the existing arrangements. At these talks,
  
 India was represented by the Principal Secretary in the Department of Atomic En
 ergy, 
 Shri H.N. Sethna, and Secretary in the Ministry, Shri Eric Gonsalves. The US de
 le- 
 gation was led by Assistant Secretary, Mr. James Malone. At the end of the thir
 d 
 round of official discussions, the Indian delegation presented a report on the 
 talks 
 which is now under consideration by the Government. 
  
   <br><br>The annual session of the Indo-US Joint Commission scheduled to take place in
  
 New Delhi in December, was postponed at the instance of the US Government becau
 se 
 of developments in Poland. The Sub-Commission on Education and Culture of the 
 
 Indo-US Joint Commission met at Philadelphia in March 1981, under the co-chairm
 an- 
 ship of Shri G. Parthasarathy and Dr. Franklin Long. The Sub-Commission on Scie
 nce 
 and Technology held its annual meeting in December in New Delhi and was co-chai
 red 
 by Prof. M.G.K. Menon and Dr. Roger Revelle. The Economic and Commercial Sub- 
 
 Commission which was unable to meet as scheduled in 1981, is likely to do so in
  
 February 1982. 
  
   <br><br>The friendly relations between India and Canada were further strengthened 
 during the year which provided an opportunity to exchange and understand each o
 ther's 
  
                              <br><br>pg29<br><br>
  
 views on major bilateral and international issues in greater depth. The Prime M
 inister 
 met the Canadian Prime Minister at Nairobi, in Melbourne at the meeting of the 
 Com- 
 monwealth Heads of Government and again, during the Cancun Summit in October. 
 
  
  <br><br> The Vice-President of India visited Canada in October. Earlier, the Lok Sabha
  
 Speaker, Dr. Balram Jakhar, attended the 6th Conference of Speakers and Presidi
 ng 
 Officers of the Commonwealth Parliament in April 1981. 
  
  <br><br> The Canadian Minister for Immigration and Manpower, Mr. Lloyd Axworthy, 
 visited India in September-October. He held talks with the Home Minister, the 
 
 Minister for industry and Labour, and with the officials of the External Affair
 s Ministry. 
 The Canadian Minister of State for Trade in the Department of Industry, Trade a
 nd 
 Commerce, Mr. Edward Lumley, visited India in February 1981. 
  
  <br><br> In accordance with established practice, India and Canada held talks at the 
 
 officials' level in New Delhi during which the two sides exchanged opinions on 
 a 
 number of issues both in the bilateral and in the multilateral fields. 
  
 <br><br>SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAS AND THE CARIBBEAN 
  
 <br><br>  In the first few years after independence, India's contacts with the countrie
 s 
 of Latin America and the Caribbean were rather minimal. There was not much com-
  
 mon ground politically or economically and the Latin American states tended to 
 
 confine their attention more to their region and its immediate periphery. Howev
 er 
 in course of time, with the increasing political awareness in these countries c
 oupled 
 with the availability of greater international opportunities for forging politi
 cal and 
 economic ties with other independent developing countries, the perspective bega
 n 
 to change for the countries of the area. 
  
 <br><br>  Sensing the changing social and political mood in the Latin and Central Ameri
 cas 
 and the Caribbean, India readily extended its hand of friendship. As a result, 
 the 
 relations between India and these countries which were somewhat formal to start
  
 with underwent a sea-change to reach the present level of friendship, cordialit
 y and 
 mutual respect. 
  
  <br><br> Today, India's multifaceted relationship with these countries is based on cer
 tain 
 shared perceptions among which are non-alignment as an approach to world peace,
  
 the need for unity and cooperation among the developing countries in a fast det
 erio- 
 rating world political and economic climate, and the necessity to prevent confl
 icting in- 
 terests of the big powers from interfering with their political and economic de
 velopment. 
 Through the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77, India and these countries
  
 have jointly been able to make their voice heard in important international for
 ums, 
 particularly the UN and the North-South dialogue. Besides, India with the third
  
 largest trained manpower in the world has been in an advantageous position to m
 eet 
  
                             <br><br>pg30<br><br>
  
 the increasing requirements of professional and technical services in several o
 f these 
 countries, particularly in Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Jamaica, Bra
 zil 
 and Panama. 
  
   <br><br>The growing political and economic relationship between India and the Latin 
 
 American states was also reflected in the number of visits exchanged at various
  levels. 
 The Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, during her stay at Cancun for the N
 orth- 
 South Summit in October, was able to meet and renew contacts with many heads of
  
 government of the countries of that region. Earlier, in May, the Minister of Ex
 ternal 
 Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, participated in the International Conference 
 on 
 Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries, held in Venezuela. In Septem- 
 
 ber, the Minister of State for Energy, Shri Vikram Mahajan, represented the Pri
 me 
 Minister at the independence celebrations of the erstwhile British colony of Be
 lize. 
 A Parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, visited Cuba. 
 
  
  <br><br> In the economic field, the visit of the Minister of Commerce to Argentina in 
 
 July to preside over the conference of the Indian commercial representatives in
  
 Latin America, was significant. He also held bilateral talks with the Argentini
 an 
 authorities and a trade agreement was signed. With a view to further strengthen
 ing 
 commercial ties between India and the Latin American states, a delegation of th
 e 
 Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry led by its President 
 visited Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. The study conducted 
 
 by this delegation, as well as the survey carried out by the various Department
 s of 
 the Government of India indicated scope for a considerable expansion of trade. 
 India 
 also sought to encourage the participation of the Latin American states in the 
 India 
 International Trade Fair held in New Delhi in November-December. For this purpo
 se, 
 Chairman of the Trade Fair Authority of India, Shri Mohammed Yunus visited Agre
 n- 
 tina, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela as a special envoy of the Prime Minister. 
 
  
  <br><br> India's close relations with Cuba were reaffirmed during the year. Besides 
 attending the Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers' Conference in New Delhi in Februar
 y 
 1981, the Cuban Foreign Minister visited India many times, as one of the four-m
 ember 
 team designated by the Non-Aligned Conference to act as mediator in the Iran-Ir
 aq 
 conflict. The Cuban Vice-Minister of Public Health paid a visit in June. 
  
 <br><br>  Another important visit to India during the earlier part of the year was that
  
 of the Vice-President of Guyana, Mr Shiv Naraine in February 1981. Guyana parti
 - 
 cipated in the India International Trade Fair. 
   The commercial and economic relations between India and Mexico are expected 
 
 to be further strengthened after the signature in the near future, of an agreem
 ent on 
  
                        <br><br>pg31<br><br>
  
 technical, economic and scientific cooperation. The visit of the Mexican Presid
 ent in 
 January 1981, had given in impetus to the growing cooperation between the two 
 
 countries. 
  
  <br><br> India's relations with Venezuela in the political and economic spheres have s
 een 
 an upsurge in the recent years. The Minister of External Affairs had visited th
 at country 
 in April 1980 as a result of which an important oil agreement had been signed i
 n 
 January 1981. In a recent bilateral review, the contract for the supply of oil 
 to India 
 was extended till December 1982. In the political sphere, the visit of the Vene
 zuelan 
 Foreign Minister in July and the State visit of the President of Venezuela in N
 ovember, 
 were significant. 
  
 <br><br>  During the year under review, Parliamentary delegations from Colombia, Ecuado
 r 
 and Brazil, visited India. 
  
  <br><br> The Indo-Argentinian agreement of 1974 on the peaceful utilisation of atomic 
 
 energy was ratified by India in April 1981. The Government of India has conveye
 d 
 to the Government of Brazil its interest in concluding an agreement on scientif
 ic and 
 technical cooperation. It has agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding on 
 
 economic, technical and scientific cooperation with the Government of Trinidad 
 &amp; 
 Tobago, as suggested by the latter.

 <br><br>CHAPTER VIII 
  
 <br><br>UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES 
  
  <br><br> India played host to the Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Count
 ries 
 held in New Delhi from 9 to 13 February. It also participated in a number of ot
 her 
 important conferences. Reflecting the growing concern of the international comm
 unity 
 over the situation in Southern Africa, a number of these conferences were relat
 ed to 
 the questions of Namibia and the policies of apartheid of the Government of Sou
 th 
 Africa. These were, the resumed sitting of the 35th Session of the UN General A
 ssembly 
 from 2 to 7 March; the Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of Non-A
 ligned 
 Countries at Algiers from 16 to 18 April; the International Conference on Sanct
 ions 
 against South Africa in Paris from 20 to 27 May and the Eighth Emergency Specia
 l 
 Session of the UN General Assembly from 3 to 14 September. 
  
   Other important conferences in which India participated were, the UN Conferen
 ce 
 on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in Nairobi from 20 to 21 August; the UN 
 
 Conference on Least Developed Countries in Paris from 1 to 14 September; and th
 e 
 Summit Meeting at Cancun (Mexico) on 22 and 23 October. 
  
   India participated in the meeting of the Heads of Government of the Common- 
 
 wealth countries held at Melbourne from 30 September to 7 October. 
  
 Non-Aligned Conference/Meetings 
  
   The Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned countries was held in New 
 
 Delhi from 9 to 13 February. It was attended by 93 member countries. While 15 
 
 countries and organisations took part in the Conference as observers, another 2
 2 attended 
 as guests. The Conference was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indir
 a 
 Gandhi. Welcoming the delegates, the Prime Minister said: "The realities of the
  world 
 situation--the possibility of a nuclear armageddon by a single lapse or rash ac
 t-reinforce 
 the relevance of non-alignment and demand rededication to peace. From this Con-
  
 ference should issue a call to the big powers to de-escalate belligerent rhetor
 ic, to 
 reduce presence in the Indian Ocean and in the various parts of Asia and Africa
 , and 
 to resume the earnest search for understanding and peace." The inspiring inaugu
 ral 
 address of the Prime Minister was widely acclaimed as a significant contributio
 n to the 
 deliberations and the successful outcome of the Conference. The Minister of Ext
 ernal 
 Affairs, Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, was elected Chairman of the Conference by acc
 la- 
 mation. 
  
   <br><br>The Foreign Ministers welcomed the admission of St. Lucia as a full member of
  
 the Non-Aligned Movement as well as the participation of the Republic of Zimbab
 we 
 for the first time, as a fully independent and sovereign nation. 
  
                               <br><br>pg33<br><br>
  
   A special commemorative session was convened during the Conference on 11 
 February to celebrate the Twentieth Anniversary of the First Summit Conference 
 of 
 Non-Aligned countries held in Belgrade in 1961. Addressing the session, the Pri
 me 
 Minister said : "The renewal of assertive animosity between great powers, the c
 ompetition 
 of military presence in various parts of the globe, particularly in West, South
  and South- 
 East Asia, the vertical increase in the stockpiles of nuclear weapon powers, th
 e neglect 
 of economic development and unfair practice in international trade--all these p
 roject 
 new problems to challenge and justify our own endeavours. Our obligation is to 
 exercise 
 our independent judgment, to individually build self-reliance and collectively 
 resist 
 moves to divide us". The session received messages from the Heads of State or G
 overn- 
 ment of a number of countries. The session also heard an address by the then Se
 cretary- 
 General of the United Nations, Dr. Kurt Waldheim. The session adopted, by accla
 - 
 mation, an Appeal and a Resolution recommending the governments of all non- 
 aligned countries to institute during 1981, appropriate programmes for celebrat
 ing the 
 historic anniversary at the national level and decided to proclaim 1 September 
 as the 
 Day of Non-Alignment and recommended its annual observance. 
  
 <br><br>  The Conference adopted a Final Declaration containing a political part and an
  
 economic part as well as an Action Programme for Economic Cooperation. As host 
 
 country and Chairman of the Conference, India made strenuous and successful eff
 orts 
 at achieving the largest possible measure of consensus on various issues before
  the Con- 
 ference, thus preserving, if not enhancing, the unity and strength of the Movem
 ent. 
  
  <br><br> The New Delhi Declaration encompassed important political and economic issues
  
 like the Role of the Movement and Policy of Non-Alignment, Review of the Intern
 a- 
 tional situation, Indian Ocean, Southern Africa, Middle East, Afghanistan and t
 he 
 Iran-Iraq conflict, an Assessment of the World Economic Situation and the Estab
 lish- 
 merit of the New International Economic Order. Vital issues such as energy, mon
 ey 
 and finance, food and agriculture, science and technology and trade also figure
 d in the 
 Declaration. Efforts to implement the Action Programme for economic cooperation
  
 among non-aligned and other developing countries and measures to promote collec
 - 
 tive self-reliance and mutual economic development were stressed. As Chairman o
 f 
 the, Conference, India was credited with conducting it in an objective and non-
 partisan 
 manner. 
  
 <br><br>  In pursuance of the decision taken at the New Delhi Conference of Foreign Min
 is- 
 ters of Non-Aligned countries, an extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the Coor
 di- 
 nating Bureau of Non-Aligned countries was held in Algiers from 16 to 18 April,
  to con - 
 sider the question of Namibia. The meeting was attended by all the 34 members o
 f 
 the Coordinating Bureau along with 42 other non-aligned countries. The Indian d
 ele- 
 gation was led by the Minister of External Affairs. The final communique adopte
 d 
 at the Algiers meeting rejected attempts by certain Western powers to modify or
  dilute 
 the elements contained in the UN plan. It reiterated support for the armed stru
 ggle 
 being waged by SWAPO against South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. The 
 
 Minister of External Affairs also announced a pledge by India of US $ 20,000 to
  the 
 special Non-Aligned Fund for Namibia and India's continued support to the Front
  
 line States which were making sacrifices for the cause of Namibian independence
 . 
  
                           <br><br>pg34<br><br>
  
 India's support was also reiterated for the speedy implementation, within a tim
 e frame, 
 of the UN plan contained in Security Council Resolution 435 (1978), and the nee
 d 
 for the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria re
 gime. 
  
   India participated in the second meeting of the Co-ordinators of Non-Aligned 
 
 Countries for Food and Agriculture, and the first food symposium of Non-Aligned
  and 
 other developing countries held in Pyongyang in June and August respectively. 
 
  
 <br><br>Commonwealth Summit Conference at Melbourne 
  
   Of the 41 countries which attended the Commnowealth Heads of Government 
 Conference at Melbourne, from 29 September to 7 October, 30 were represented by
  
 their Presidents and Prime Ministers. The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Malc
 olm 
 Fraser chaired the Conference. The Indian delegation was led by the Prime Minis
 ter 
 and included the Minister of External Affairs and senior officials, The meeting
  wel- 
 comed Zimbabwe, Vanuatu and Belize as new members and extended similar greeting
 s 
 to St. Vincent and the Grenadines which had become a special member. 
  
 <br><br>  The meeting issued a final communique and a sixteen-point declaration, descri
 bed 
 as the first collective political statement by the Commonwealth on North-South 
 issues 
 which urged all other nations to join the Commonwealth countries in breaking th
 e im- 
 passe. The Melbourne Declaration recognised that inequality of wealth in the Wo
 rld 
 and especially "the cycle of poverty of the millions living in developing count
 ries are 
 fundamental sources of tension and instability in the world". The Declaration u
 rged, 
 that "while the most urgent humanitarian" considerations demand action, self in
 terest 
 itself warrants a constructive and positive approach to these great human probl
 ems by 
 all governments. In this context, it called upon the developed countries to rea
 ch the 
 target of development assistance; expressed support to multilateral institution
 s and 
 called for the creation of a World Bank affiliate on energy. 
  
 <br><br>  On the political side, the final communique expressed the concern of the Head
 s 
 of Government regarding the slide from detente to confrontation, mounting tensi
 on 
 between the big powers and the build up of nuclear arms threatening the very su
 rvival 
 of mankind. Reviewing the developments in Southern Africa, the participants 
 reaffirmed their total and unequivocal condemnation of apartheid as a crime aga
 inst 
 humanity and their total rejection of all policies designed to perpetuate this 
 inhuman 
 system. They reaffirmed the Gleneagles Agreement of 1977, and reiterated their 
 com- 
 mitment to fulfilling effectively, their obligations under it. On Namibia, they
  registered 
 their grave disappointment that the pre-implementation meeting in Geneva in Jan
 uary 
 1981 had been aborted by the refusal of the South African Government to agree t
 o a 
 date for the implementation of the Security Council resolution 435 (1978), and 
 urged 
 the Western Contact Group to intensify efforts to secure the implementation of 
 that 
 resolution without modification or dilution as early as possible in 1982. 
  
   India has agreed to host the next meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Govern
 - 
 ment likely to take place towards the end of 1983.

 The UN System : Namibia and the issue of sanctions against South Africa 
  
   Consideration of the question of Namibia by the 35th Session of the UN Genera
 l 
 Assembly was postponed to its resumed session held from 2 to 7 March, consequen
 t 
 to the pre-implementation Geneva talks (from 7 to 14 January) and the New Delhi
  
 Conference of the Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries. 
  
 <br><br> The resumed session on 2 March, was marked by the rejection, once again, of t
 he 
 credentials of the South Africa delegation as recommended by its Credentials Co
 mmittee. 
  
  <br><br> After a protracted debate, the resumed session of the UN General Assembly 
 adopted ten resolutions related to the different aspects of the question of Nam
 ibia. 
 India co-sponsored all of them. The main element in the political resolution wa
 s the 
 call on the Security Council to convene urgently to impose comprehensive, manda
 tory 
 sanctions against South Africa and a provision for the General Assembly to cons
 ider 
 necessary action in the event of the Security Council's inability to adopt conc
 rete mea- 
 sures. 
  
   <br><br>India took an active part in the deliberations on the question of Namibia in 
 the 
 resumed session. India's ststement during the debate set forth its consistent a
 nd prin- 
 cipled position in support of the early exercise by the Namibian people of thei
 r right 
 to self-determination and independence. It was emphasised, that the pre-impleme
 n- 
 tation meeting was itself a concession to South Africa to give it a final oppor
 tunity to 
 bring about a peaceful transition to independence in Namibia. Its failure had s
 hown 
 that SWAPO's hands should be strengthened to intensify the struggle and the UN 
 
 should fully isolate South Africa politically and economically, to compel it to
  imple- 
 ment the UN resolutions. 
  
  <br><br> The United Nations in collaboration with the OAU, convened an international 
 
 Conference on Sanctions against South Africa in Paris, from 20 to 27 May, in pu
 r- 
 suance of resolution 35/206-I adopted by the General Assembly on Dec 16, 1980. 
 
 The Conference was attended by 120 member-States and a number of inter-governme
 n- 
 tal, international non-governmental organisations as well as representatives of
  the 
 liberation movements of South Africa Namibia and the PLO. The Western Five 
 (Canada, France, FRG, UK and USA) as also Australia, New Zealand and Japan, 
 did not participate in the Conference. Prime Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi in
  her 
 message to the Conference called upon the Western powers to uphold the provisio
 ns 
 of UN Charter pertaining to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a
 nd 
 to give up their support to the Pretoria regime. The alternative could be a pro
 longed 
 armed struggle and greater suffering for the people of South Africa. 
  
 <br><br>  The Indian delegation to the Conference was led by the Minister of External 
 
 Affairs. Addressing the Conference on 22 May, 1981, Shri Narasimha Rao reiterat
 ed 
 India's total moral and material support to the measures that the Conference wo
 uld 
 adopt. The Conference adopted by consensus, a special declaration on Namibia. 
 
 The Declaration, inter-alia affirmed that sanctions provided under Chapter VII 
 of the 
 UN Charter universally applied, would be the most appropriate and effective mea
 sns 
 to ensure South Africa's compliance with the decisions of the United Nations. 
 
  
<br><br>pg36<br><br> 
  
   In view of the fact that Security Council failed to impose mandatory sanction
 s against 
 South Africa on account of the veto used by the three Western permanent members
 , 
 viz. USA, UK and France, an emergency special session of the UNGA was held from
  
 3 to 4 September to discuss the question of Namibia. The Assembly, at the outse
 t, 
 rejected the credentials of South Africa by accepting the report. The resolutio
 n adop- 
 ted by the General Assembly strongly urged the Security Council in the light of
  the 
 serious threat to international peace and security posed by South Africa, to im
 media- 
 tely impose comprehensive sanctions against South Africa and to cease forthwith
 , in- 
 dividually and collectively, all dealings with that country in order to isolate
  it totally. 
 India took an active part in the drafting of the working paper on which the res
 olution 
 on Namibia as adopted by the special session was based. 
  
 <br><br>Other UN Conferences 
  
  <br><br> The UN Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy (NRSE) was 
 held in Nairobi from 10 to 21 August. The Conference was attended by 125 member
 - 
 States and a number of inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations. T
 he 
 Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, delivered the keynote address to the Co
 nference. 
 She called on the world community to make energy a focal point of contemporary 
 in- 
 ternational cooperation based on equitable distribution of conventional stocks 
 and 
 joint development of new and renewable sources of energy. The Prime Minister, i
 n 
 her address, also made suggestions for (a) creating an international consortium
  dedi- 
 cated to mobilising bilateral credit and aid from institutions and (b) an expan
 ded pro- 
 gramme for technical assistance in energy planning, manpower training and suppo
 rt 
 to research and development and pre-investment studies. 
  
  <br><br> The Indian delegation to the Conference was led by the Minister of State for 
 
 Science and Technology, Electronics and Environment, Shri C.P.N. Singh. India 
 
 was elected one of the Vice-Presidents of the Conference. 
  
   The Conference adopted a Plan of Action, the principal features of which were
  
 a framework of national action to promote the development of NRSE in the contex
 t 
 of integrated energy planning, sharing of international technological and finan
 cial sup- 
 port and acceptance of consortium approach for mobilization of resources. 
  
   The UN Conference on Least Developed Countries was held in Paris from 1 to 
 14 September, in pursuance of the recommendation of UNCTAD-V. Delegates from 
 more than 142 countries attended the Conference. The Indian delegation to the c
 on- 
 ference was led by the Minister of State for Commerce, Shri Khurshid Alam Khan.
  
 The Conference adopted by consensus, a Substantial New Programme of Action that
  
 will increase aid to the least developed countries in the 1980s and help bring 
 about a 
 restructuring of their economies in the interest of enhancing their long-term v
 iability. 
 Under the Programme, the overall Official Development Assistance flow target of
  0.7 
 per cent of the Gross National Product was also reaffirmed. Most donor countrie
 s 
 made a commitment though not categorical, that within the frame work of the gen
 eral 
 increase, an ODA of 0.15 per cent of their GNP could be devoted to the LDCS. In
 dia 
 played an effective and constructive role in shaping the outcome of the Confere
 nce and 
 was instrumental in projecting a unified image of G-77 throughout the Conferenc
 e.

 36th Session of UN General Assembly 
  
   The United Nations General Assembly commenced its 36th Session on 15 Septem 
 
 ber. The provisional agenda of the Assembly contained as many as 134 items rela
 ting 
 to international political problems, disarmament, decolonisation, economic and 
 financial 
 questions, social, humanitarian and cultural issues, administration and budget 
 and 
 international legal subjects. The President of the 1981 session of the General 
 Assem- 
 bly was Mr. Ismat Kittani of Iraq. He was elected by the General Assembly after
  a 
 contest with Mr. Kaiser of Bangladesh and Mr. Koh of Singapore. 
  
  <br><br> Another important election was that of the next UN Secretary-General. Dr. 
 Kurt Waldheim whose second five-year term ended on 31 December, was seeking a 
 
 third term. The other candidate in the field was the Tanzanian Foreign Minister
 , Mr. 
 Salim Ahmed Salim, whose candidature had been endorsed by both the OAU and the 
 
 Non-Aligned Group. However, after a number of rounds of balloting in the Securi
 ty 
 Council, neither of the candidates could receive the Council's recommendation f
 or 
 nomination. In the end, both of them withdrew their names from further ballotin
 g and 
 Mr. Javier Perez de Cueller, a senior Peruvian diplomat, was elected as UN Secr
 etary- 
 General for a five year term commencing on 1 January, 1982. Messages of felicit
 ation 
 were sent both by the Prime Minister of India and the Minister of External Affa
 irs to 
 the new Secretary-General. 
  
  <br><br> The membership of the United Nations went up to 157 with the admission of 
 three new members namely, Vanuatu, Belize, and Antigua and Barbuda. 
  
   The Assembly suspended its session on 12 December, after it had concluded con
 - 
 sideration of most of the items on its agenda with a decision to reconvene in t
 he latter 
 half of 1982 to discuss its remaining business. 
  
   The Indian delegation to the 36th Session of the General Assembly was led by 
 the 
 Minister of External Affairs. As in previous years, India played an active role
  in the 
 deliberations of the General Assembly and its Committees. In his address to the
  Gener- 
 al Assembly, the Minister of External Affairs underlined India's firm commitmen
 t 
 to the principles of the UN Charter and of Non-alignment which were based on th
 e 
 objective necessity to contribute in a positive manner towards the creation of 
 a peaceful 
 and cooperative world. The Minister reviewed the economic and technological pro
 - 
 gress made by India, India's relations with her neighbours, the dangerous devel
 op- 
 ments in the nuclear arms race, the situation in the Indian Ocean, Afghanisatan
 , the 
 Iran-Iraq war, South, East Asia, Palestine, Namibia, and the World economic sit
 ua- 
 tion. He concluded by stating that the "North and South must share the same obj
 ec- 
 tives as their destinies are intertwined. Together we can make sure that while 
 
 following our paths, we can contribute to each other's prosperity as well as se
 curity 
 provided we follow the logic of peaceful cooperation and steer clear of the twi
 n mis- 
 takes of isolation and confrontation". 
  
 <br><br>  The plenary of the General Assembly adopted as many as 16 resolutions on Sout
 h 
 Africa on the recommendation of the Special Committee against Apartheid. Most o
 f 
 these resolutions were Co-sponsored by India. In this context, it may be mentio
 ned, 
  
                               <br><br>pg38<br><br>
  
 that to give effect to the UN International Convention on the suppression and p
 unish- 
 ment of the Crime of Apartheid, 1973, to which India had become a party in Octo
 ber 
 1977, the Minister of External Affairs had introduced the Anti-Apartheid Bill i
 n the 
 Indian Parliament. This was passed on 31 August and 7 December, by the Lok Sabh
 a 
 and the Rajya Sabha respectively. 
  
   The question of Namibia was once again considered in the plenary of the Gener
 al 
 Assembly when as many as six draft resolutions on various aspects initiated by 
 the 
 UN Council for Namibia, were adopted. In view of India's principled and consist
 ent 
 stand on this issue, it voted in favour of all the resolutions. The draft resol
 ution on the 
 work programme of the UN Council for Namibia was also introduced by India. 
  
   The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly adopted two resolutions on 
 Western Sahara. One resolution tabled by Kenya in its capacity as the current C
 hair- 
 man of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was adopted by consensus, while
  
 the other resolution tabled by Algeria (and co-sponsored by 32 other non-aligne
 d 
 countries), was adopted by a vote of 73 in favour, 7 against and 54 abstentions
 . In the 
 plenary, the Algerian draft was adopted by 76 votes in favour, 9 against and 57
  absten- 
 tions. India voted in favour of the Algerian resolution as there was no contrad
 iction 
 between the OAU decision taken at its Nairobi Conference and the Algerian resol
 ution. 
  
   The question of Kampuchea again proved to be controversial in the deliberatio
 ns 
 of the General Assembly. The credentials of Democratic Kampuchea were once agai
 n 
 endorsed by the General Assembly. An amendment to exclude the acceptance of the
  
 credentials of Democratic Kampuchea sponsored by 14 non-aligned countries inclu
 - 
 ding India, was not accepted. 
  
   The General Assembly also adopted a resolution, calling, inter alia, for the 
 with- 
 drawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and adopting the results of the Interna
 tional 
 Conference on Kampuchea (New York, July 1981). India abstained. It might be 
 mentioned, that India had decided not to attend the International Conference on
  Kam- 
 puchea because it was felt that any international conference would need to reas
 sure the 
 people of Kampuchea that the process of normalisation within that country after
  the 
 holocaust they had suffered during the Pol Pot regime, would not be reversed. A
  
 Conference which accorded recognition to the Pol Pot regime would not have serv
 ed 
 this purpose. Secondly, India remained convinced that a peaceful political solu
 tion 
 could only be achieved through a dialogue between the countries of the region. 
 An 
 international conference based on a resolution rejected by several of the count
 ries 
 directly concerned, could only retard the prospects of a meaningful dialogue. 
 
 <br><br> 
   The UN General Assembly again adopted a resolution on the situation in Afghan
 is- 
 tan which had been tabled by members of the Islamic Conference, by a vote of 11
 6 in 
 favour, 23 against and 12 abstentions. India abstained on the resolution which,
  inter 
 alia., called for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan a
 nd for 
 a political solution in accordance with the provisions of the UNGA resolution. 
 A 
 similar resolution was adopted by the UNGA in August 1980, by 111 votes in favo
 ur, 
 22 against and 12 abstentions. 
  
                              <br><br>pg39<br><br>
  
   In spite of four formal sessions and intensive informal counsultations, there
  was 
 no agreement on the implementation of the earlier UN General Assembly decision 
 
 on the convening of a Conference on the Indian Ocean. The Western powers main- 
 
 tained the view, that there was no possibility of convening a Conference in the
  foresee- 
 able future in view of the continuing foreign intervention in Afghanistan and l
 ack of 
 harmonisation of views within the UN ad hoc Committee with regard to the concep
 t of 
 the zone of peace and, therefore, with regard to the objectives of the Conferen
 ce. After 
 months of intensive negotiations, the ad hoc Committee on Indian Ocean finally 
 agreed 
 on a compromise draft resolution which was adopted by the General Assembly with
 out 
 a vote. The resolution, inter alia, emphasised the General Assembly's decision 
 to con- 
 vene a conference on the Indian Ocean at Colombo, Sri Lanka, as a necessary ste
 p for 
 the implementation of the 1971 Declaration on the Indian Ocean as a zone of Pea
 ce. 
 The resolution also requested the ad hoc Committee "to make every effort to acc
 omplish 
 the necessary preparatory work for the Conference including consideration of it
 s con- 
 vening not later than the first half of 1983". India played an active and const
 ructive 
 role in the deliberations of the ad hoc Committee. The prospects of holding a C
 onfer- 
 ence on the Indian Ocean as, scheduled, are dependent on the attitude, of the b
 ig 
 powers. 
  
  <br><br> As in previous years, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored 
 
 by Pakistan on the establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in South Asia, 
 
 by 93 votes in favour, 3 against (India, Bhutan and Mauritius) and 44 abstentio
 ns. 
 Registering India's opposition to the Pakistani resolution, the Indian delegate
  stated 
 that the proposal did not conform to the principles laid down for the setting u
 p of a 
 nuclear weapon free zone the initiave for which should come from the states of 
 the 
 region concerned, on the basis of their common security concerns and common per
 - 
 ceptions of the threat to their security. The Pakistani proposal did not also t
 ake into 
 account the geopolitical situation and the security environment which currently
  pre- 
 vailed in the region of Asia-Pacific and which had a direct bearing on the secu
 rity of 
 South Asian States. All these factors, complicated by the deployment of nuclear
  wea- 
 pons in the Asia-Pacific region, and the presence of foreign military bases in 
 the Indian 
 Ocean, made the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in South Asia inapp
 ro- 
 priate. 
  
  <br><br> The question of Israel's attack on Iraq's nuclear installations was discussed
  in 
 the General Assembly under an item proposed by Iraq. The General Assembly adopt
 ed 
 a resolution condemning, inter alia, Israel for its premeditated and unpreceden
 ted act 
 of aggression against Iraq in violation of the UN Charter and the norms of inte
 rna- 
 tional conduct. The resolution also demanded that Israel, in view of its intern
 ational 
 responsibility for its act of aggression, pay prompt and adequate compensation 
 for the 
 material damage and loss of life suffered as a result of its aggression. India 
 voted in 
 favour of the resolution. The Indian delegate while condemning in the strongest
  
 terms the unprovoked and unjustified act of aggression committed by Israel agai
 nst 
 Iraq, emphasised that the "linking of issues, such as the Non-Proliferation Tre
 aty (NPT) 
 of full scope or other safeguards to the present question is not relevant and d
 etracts 
 from the central issue to be addressed which is that of aggression". The delega
 te went 
  
                       <br><br>pg40<br><br>
  
 on to add, that India's position on "Issues such as the NPT and full scope safe
 guards 
 remains unchanged", and that India viewed references to these issues as they ap
 peared 
 in the context of its well-known position. 
  
   On 15 May, India signed the Inhuman Weapons Convention (Convention on 
 prohibition of or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which
  may be 
 deemed to be excessively injurious or have indiscriminate effects) and its thre
 e annexed 
 Protocols relating to (i) non-detectable fragments, (ii) mines, booby traps and
  other 
 devices, and (iii) incendiary weapons. 
  
  <br><br> At the UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC) in New York, India tabled a wor- 
 king paper on the question of a UN Study on disarmament ralating to conventiona
 l 
 weapons, in which it was stated, inter alia, that it would be one-sided to cons
 ider merely 
 the question of international trade in conventional arms which affected the sma
 ll, 
 developing or non-aligned States only, but all kinds of arrangements within mil
 itary 
 alliances namely, gifts, off-sets, deployments, prepositioning, co-production, 
 standardi- 
 zation and technical cooperation. 
  
 <br><br>  At the Committee on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva India tabled a working paper 
 
 on the question of verification in the field of disarmament in which it was, in
 ter alia, 
 stressed, that any worthwhile and universally acceptable system of controls wou
 ld 
 necessarily have to be based on objective, scientific, and non-discriminatory c
 riteria and 
 should be made applicable to all states without exception, 
  
   At the 36th Session of the General Assembly in New York, India pressed forwar
 d 
 its initiative first taken in 1978 in the question of prohibition of the use of
  nuclear 
 weapons pending nuclear disarmament. India's resolution whereby the General 
 Assembly once again declared that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violati
 on 
 of the Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, was adopted 
 by an 
 overwhelming majority of 121 votes in favour, 19 against and 6 abstentions. Of 
 the 
 nuclear-weapon States, China and the Soviet Union voted in favour, while the Un
 ited 
 States, the United Kingdom and France voted against. It may be noted that the U
 SSR 
 voted for the Indian resolution for the first time, while China, which had firs
 t done so 
 at the 35th session, maintained its positive vote. 
  
  <br><br> The 36th Session of the General Assembly could not take any specific decision
 s rela- 
 ting to the launching of Global Negotiations, an agenda item which had been car
 ried 
 forward from the previous sessions. Following the Cancum Summit, it was expecte
 d 
 that a decision on Global Negotiations would be possible in the General Assembl
 y and 
 there were protracted negotiations on this subject. However, no consensus could
  emerge 
 regarding some crucial questions such as the scope and agenda of the proposed n
 ego- 
 tiations and the competence and role of specialised agencies. India as an activ
 e member 
 of Group-77, played a constructive role in the deliberations regarding Global N
 ego- 
 tiations. A decision has been taken to transmit this matter to the resumed sess
 ion of 
 the General Assembly to be held in the latter half of January 1982. 
  
 <br><br>  India played an active role in the drafting and adoption of a large number of
  re- 
 solutions in the Second Committee and in the General Assembly, such as on the c
 onven- 
 ing of a conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, a financing System 
 for 
  
                              <br><br>pg41<br><br>
  
 Science and Technology, on the United Nations Environment Programme, a resolu- 
 
 tion on Inter-relations between Resources, Environment, People and Development,
  
 and a resolution on the UN Conference on Trade and Development. 
  
   Other important resolutions adopted at the 36th General Assembly relate to th
 e 
 Multilateral Fibre Agreement, Report of the World Food Council, UN Conference o
 n 
 Least Developed Countries, World Population Conference, UN Population Award, 
 and Strengthening the UN capacity to respond to Natural Disasters and other Dis
 aster 
 situations. 
  
  <br><br> The Third Committee of the 36th General Assembly's session adopted without a 
 
 vote, the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance based on R
 eligion 
 and Relief. Substantive work on the Declaration had begun in 1962 but it had ta
 ken the 
 Human Rights Commission almost 19 years to finalise the draft Declaration. Indi
 a 
 pioneered the draft resolution on National Institutions for the promotion and p
 rotection 
 of human rights. This was in consonance with the Government of India's known po
 si- 
 tion, that national institutions are the best guarantee for the promotion and p
 rotection 
 of human rights and hence the national governments should strengthen them inste
 ad of 
 creating additional international institutions like the post of UN High Commiss
 ioner for 
 Human Rights or regional commissions. 
  
 International Law: Developments and Activities 
  
  <br><br> At the 36th Session of the General Assembly, the Sixth Committee considered t
 he 
 report of the Ad hoc Committee on the Drafting of a convention against the recr
 uitment, 
 use, financing and training of mercenaries. While there was general condemnatio
 n of 
 the use of mercenaries, opinions differed on the substantive aspect of the defi
 nition of 
 mercenaries, particularly among the western delegations who favoured a harmonis
 ation 
 of national criminal law as well as international collaboration on the lines of
  hijacking 
 conventions. Upon the recommendations of the Sixth Committee, the General Assem
 b- 
 ly adopted a resolution in which it decided that the Ad hoc Committee was to co
 ntinue 
 its work of drafting an International Convention on the subject. 
  
 <br><br>  During the year, the International Law Commission adopted the final text of t
 he 
 draft articles on Succession of States in respect of state property, archives a
 nd debts, 
 and recommended that an international Conference of plenipotentiaries may be co
 n- 
 vened to conclude a convention on the subject. The Commission also commenced it
 s 
 second reading of the draft articles on the subject of treaties concluded betwe
 en states 
 and international organisations or between international organisations themselv
 es. 
  
  <br><br> During the year, the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea held two sessi
 ons; 
 the Tenth Session in New York, from 9 March to 16 April and the resumed Tenth 
 
 Session, in Geneva from 3 to 28 August. However, on account of the United State
 s' 
 lack of interest in active participation pending a thorough review by it of the
  packag 
 of compromises that had thus far been developed, the Conference could not make 
 any 
 substantial progress. Even at the resumed Tenth Session in Geneva, the USA plea
 ded 
 for further time. The Group of 77, the East European States and some others ind
 icated 
 keen interest to sign the Convention at the earliest, with or without the parti
 cipation of 
 the USA. Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Iceland and Norway had also urged 
 the 
  
                <br><br>pg42<br><br>
  
 USA to be more cooperative towards the Convention. At the resumed session, the 
 Draft 
 Convention on the Law of the Sea was given the status of an official document o
 f the 
 conference. It was decided by a vote, that the seat of the International Seabed
  Autho- 
 rity would be in Jamica and, that of the International Tribunal for the Law of 
 the Sea, 
 at Hamburg. A significant breakthrough in the negotiations was the agreement on
  
 defining the criteria for the delimitation of maritime boundaries. The 11th Ses
 sion of 
 the Conference is scheduled to be held in New York in March-April, 1982. 
  
 <br><br>  The Legal Sub-Committee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 
 Space of which India has been a member since its inception, held its 20th Sessi
 on in 
 Geneva in March-April. Among other things, the Committee discussed the impli- 
 
 cations of remote sensing of the earth from space, the principles governing the
  use by 
 States of artificial earth satellites for direct television broadcasting, the d
 efinition and/or 
 delimitation of outer space activities. In regard to remote sensing of the eart
 h by satel- 
 lites, some questions still remained unresolved. At the conclusion of the Sessi
 on, the 
 Sub-Committee had recommended that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer 
 
<br><br> Space should consider whether the elaboration of draft principles on direct tel
 evision 
 broadcast satellites could be concluded or whether further progress could be ac
 hieved. 
 The Committee had continued its work on matters relating to the definition and/
 or 
 delimitation of outer space, in relation to geostationary orbit, but there was 
 no agree- 
 ment. There was no agreement also with regard to the question of the possibilit
 y of 
 supplementing the norms of international law relevant to the use of nuclear pow
 er 
 sources in the outer space, in spite of an extensive exchange of views on it. 
 
  
   <br><br>The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) 
 held its 14th Session at Vienna in June. Progress was made by the Working Group
 s 
 on International Contract Practices and on International Payments, and a New In
 ter- 
 national Economic Order. In view of India's considerable interest in internatio
 nal 
 trade, the Indian delegation played an active and constructive role in the work
  of the 
 Commission. 
  
  <br><br> An ad hoc meeting of Senior government officials who are experts in environme
 ntal 
 law, was organised by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), at 
 Montevideo in October-November. The object of this meeting was to establish a 
 
 framework and method and programme for the development and periodical review of
  
 Environmental Law and to contribute to the preparation and implementation of th
 e 
 environmental law component of the system-wise, medium-term environment program
 me. 
 The meeting identified subjects like marine pollution from land-based sources, 
 protection 
 of the stratospheric Ozone layer, and the transport, handling and disposal of t
 oxic and 
 dangerous wastes, as priority subjects to be dealt with by the UNEP in the fiel
 d of Inter- 
 national Environmental Law. 
  
  <br><br> The 22nd Annual Session of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee was
  
 held at Colombo in May. The Committee's report expressed concern over the delay
  
 in signing a Convention on the Law of the Sea on account of the delay caused by
  the US 
 review of the entire question. On the question of joint venture arrangements fo
 r the 
 optimum utilisation of fishery resources, the Committee reviewed the draft mode
 l equity 
  
                            <br><br>pg43<br><br>
  
 and contractual joint venture arrangements prepared by the Secretariat. In rega
 rd 
 to trade law matters, the Committee was asked to examine the matter further on 
 joint 
 investment proposals among the developing countries. 
  
   During the year, India concluded 103 treaties and agreements of which a list 
 is given 
 at appendix-I 
  
 Elections to UN bodies and other International Institutions 
  
   <br><br>During the 36th Session, India was re-elected to the World Food Council and t
 he 
 Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme for a three-year 
 term 
 beginning on 1 January, 1982. Dr. Nagendra Singh was re-elected to the Internat

<br><br> Jan 01, 1981 
  
<br><br> CHAPTER IX 
  
<br><br> FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
  
 <br><br>  During the year, international economic relations received attention at the h
 ighest 
 levels. It was a year of three summit meetings which focused their attention on
  North- 
 South issues namely, the Ottawa Summit Meeting of the Major Industrialised Coun
 - 
 tries which took place in July; the Commonwealth Summit Meeting in Melbourne 
 where economic issues dominated the discussions, and the historic Cancum Summit
  
 meeting of 22 developed and developing countries, which considered the question
  of co- 
 operation and development in the context of the future of North-South relations
  and the 
 reactivation of the world economy. India, together with likeminded countries, m
 ade a 
 determined effort to reverse the downhill trend in multilateral economic cooper
 ation. The 
 Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, sent special envoys before the Ottawa S
 ummit 
 and made strenuous efforts at Melbourne to ensure that a propitious atmosphere 
 was 
 created for the Cancun Summit. At Cancun itself, there was a free and frank exc
 hange 
 of views in a constructive spirit which has resulted in a better understanding 
 of the reali- 
 ties of inter-dependence. There were indications, in Cancun, of substantial con
 sensus 
 in the fields of food and agricultural development, some energy matters as well
  as on 
 further negotiations on trade liberalisation as a vehicle for the economic adva
 ncement of 
 developing countries. In this context, the door was left open for Global Negoti
 ations, 
 though subsequent developments in New York did not result in any perceptible mo
 ve- 
 ment forward, on this important question. 
  
 <br><br>  Against this sombre background, there were two hopeful developments. The 
 first one was the adoption of a comprehensive programme of cooperation among 
 developing countries adopted at the High Level Meeting held in Caracas in May 
 
 covering the fields of trade, raw materials, energy, food, industrialisation, t
 echnology 
 and finance and setting out concrete modalities for its implementation. The pro
 gramme 
 envisaged a series of meetings during the year 1982 which are likely to result 
 in opera- 
 tional activities in the field of economic cooperation among developing countri
 es. Other 
 highlights were: the setting up of a core group of officials to assist the Chai
 rman of the 
 Group of 77 on ECDC matters in New York, the opening of an ECDC account of the 
 
 Group of 77, the convening of annual meetings of the Inter-Governmental Coordin
 ation 
 Committee and of biennial meetings of the Group of 77 at Foreign Ministers leve
 l, for 
 reviewing progress and laying down further guidelines. 
  
 <br><br>  Nearer home, the second hopeful development related to the concrete progress 
 
 made on the subject of Regional Cooperation in South Asia during the year. As a
  
 result of the two meetings of the Foreign Secretaries of the seven South Asian 
 countries 
 on the subject, the ground rules for regional cooperation have been adopted, it
 s objec- 
 tives defined and eight important areas of cooperation identified namely, agric
 ulture, 
 rural development, telecommunications, meteorology, health and population activ
 ities, 
 transport, postal services, science and technology. The working groups on these
  
  
                            <br><br>pg45<br><br>
  
 subjects would now be drawing up concrete programmes of cooperation both of imm
 e- 
 diate nature as well as those having long-term aspects. It has been agreed that
  the 
 Foreign Secretaries would meet again in the first half of 1982 to take stock of
  the situ- 
 ation, review the work of the various groups and consider recommending a minist
 erial 
 level meeting in 1982 to approve and launch a programme of regional cooperation
 . 
  
  <br><br> An important development on the multilateral side was the successful conclusi
 on 
 of the negotiations for a loan of approximately Rs. 5300 crores from the IMF un
 der 
 its extended facility. The lack of any progress on the recommendations of the l
 ong- 
 term Strategy Committee of the OPEC, and the weakening of the commitment on the
  
 part of some important developed countries to multilateral economic cooperation
 , con- 
 firmed the fact that many of the oil importing developing countries including I
 ndia, 
 have to face a serious and protracted balance of payments problem. 
  
  <br><br> The unfortunate situation remains, that even after more than one year of the 
 adop- 
 tion of the International Development Strategy which outlined the objectives of
  inter- 
 national cooperation for the Third Development Decade, the instruments and moda
 lities 
 for achieving these objectives are lacking and there is a general atmosphere of
  a stale- 
 mate. Conscious of the need for overcoming the current stalemate, and on the su
 g- 
 gestions made by eminent personalities to the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira G
 andhi, 
 India took the initiative towards the end of the year to convene a meeting of P
 olicy- 
 making Senior Officials of selected developing countries in February 1982, to t
 ake stock 
 of the present situation in regard to North-South issues and examine the opport
 unities 
 and perspectives for South-South Cooperation. It is expected that the February 
 
 Consultations in New Delhi would succeed in building up the consensus that was 
 reached 
 in the Cancun Summit in the fields of energy and food development and would lea
 d 
 to the emergence of useful suggestions for the development of constructive Nort
 h-South 
 relations in the 1980s, in the fields of trade and finance and, above all, held
  in launching 
 the Global Negotiations for tackling the complex and inter-related problems in 
 different 
 fields. At the same time, it is hoped, that an understanding would be reached d
 uring 
 New Delhi Consultations for optimising the development of the collective self-r
 eliance 
 among developing countries through the implementation of agreed policy guidelin
 es and 
 working out of appropriate arrangements. 
  
  <br><br> The economic exchanges of India on a bilateral basis, were further strengthen
 ed 
 during the year. In the neighbourhood, the micro-wave link with Sri Lanka was c
 omple- 
 ted; the sub-marine link between Malaysia and India was set up; the work relati
 ng to 
 setting up of sub-marine link between India and the United Arab Emirates, has b
 een 
 taken in hand. There has been overall intensification of India's economic coope
 ration 
 with neighbouring countries in South Asia. 
  
  <br><br> By far the greatest activities in the field of economic and technical coopera
 tion were 
 with African countries. The visits of the Heads of State and Government from Ke
 nya, 
 Tanzania, Guinea, Madagascar, Botswana, Ghana, Uganda and Zimbabwe, were inves-
  
 ted with a great deal of economic significance. Similarly, economic cooperation
  was the 
 dominant theme during visits of the President of India to Kenya and Zambia, and
  of the 
 Prime Minister to Seychelles and Kenya. Economic and technical cooperation agre
 e- 
 ments were signed with Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ghana and Uganda. Already considerable 
 
  
                               <br><br>pg46<br><br>
  
 follow-up action has been initiated on these agreements in the form of deputati
 on of per- 
 sonnel, cooperation in exploration and exploitation of minerals, and cooperatio
 n in 
 small scale industry and rural electrification. The visit of a small scale indu
 stries team 
 and a mining team to Zimbabwe, a multi-disciplinary industry team to Kenya, a s
 pecia- 
 lists' team to Ghana to explore the possibilities of cooperation in the fields 
 of taxation, 
 sericulture, handicrafts and census, took place. 
  
 <br><br>  The Indo-Nigerian Joint Commission held its first meeting in Delhi and worked
  
 out various areas of cooperation, particularly in the fields of agriculture, ru
 ral electri- 
 fication, irrigation, education and supply of man-power. The Fourth Session of 
 the 
 Indo-Tanzanian Joint Commission reviewed the on-going projects and took importa
 nt 
 decisions in regard to financial cooperation by way of extension of credits and
  resche- 
 duling of payments. 
  
  <br><br> The Seventh Session of the Indo-Iraqi Joint Commission held in Baghdad, provi
 ded 
 an opportunity for a comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation in diverse f
 ields. 
 Iraq agreed to consider favourably, legitimate compensation claims of Indian co
 mpanies 
 for losses suffered on account of the war. War-risk insurance for Indian worker
 s and 
 experts was also introduced by the Iraqi Government. 
  
   <br><br>The Indo-Swedish Joint Commission which meets every two years to review 
 bilateral, commercial, economic and technical cooperation, met in Stockholm in 
 October. 
  
   The activities relating to economic and technical cooperation with developing
  
 countries continued with accelerated pace during the year under review. A sum o
 f 
 approximately Rs. 9 crores was earmarked for implementation of various ITEC pro
 gram- 
 mes during the financial year 1981-82 in addition to individual technical and e
 conomic 
 cooperation programmes with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. India announced 
 its contribution of Rs. 5.5 lakhs to the Group of 77 account for ECDC programme
 s. 
 Activities under the ITEC programme included gifting of two lakh tonnes of whea
 t to the 
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, a complete set of standards to Zambia, s
 pec- 
 tacle frames to Botswana Red Cross and an X-ray unit to Malawi. A total number 
 of 
 about 1,000 Indian experts were sent to developing countries during the calenda
 r year 
 1981. Trainees from sub-Saharan African countries and the People's Democratic 
 
 Republic of Yemen, in the fields of industry, management of oil companies, frui
 t and 
 vegetable processing, civil aviation, engineering subjects and oil technology, 
 were 
 received under the ITEC Programme.

<br><br> CHAPTER X 
  
 <br><br>POLICY PLANNING 
  
 <br><br>  The Policy Planning and Review Division of the Ministry was expanded and stre
 ng- 
 thened after merger with the Historical Division. It consists of Foreign Servic
 e Officers 
 and a cadre of Research Officers as well as supporting staff and facilities inc
 luding a 
 modern library. The Division functions under the guidance of the Foreign Secret
 ary 
 and supervision of an Additional Secretary. 
  
  <br><br> The Division conducts analytical studies of critical or potentially critical 
 situations 
 in various parts of the world and the policy options available to decision-make
 rs. In 
 carrying out such studies the Division coordinates its activities with other Mi
 nistries 
 and Departments in order to impart a multiple perspective to such vital questio
 ns of 
 national concern as security, trade, economy and other matters. The Division al
 so 
 maintains liaison with the Universities and Research Institutions in the countr
 y with 
 a view to encourage study of foreign policy and a deeper analysis and appreciat
 ion of 
 contemporary international problems. Officers of the Policy Planning and Review
  
 Division also maintain contacts with scholars and sometimes take part in academ
 ic 
 conferences and seminars. 
  
  <br><br> During the year under review, the Policy Planning and Review Division conduct
 ed 
 policy studies and prepared background notes on different issues of national in
 terest in 
 external spheres. These studies were circulated to Missions abroad and territor
 ial 
 divisions of the Ministry. The Division also maintained an on-going contact wit
 h the 
 area studies centres of universities where scholars are involved in research an
 d study of 
 international affairs. The officers of the Division took interest in seminars r
 elating to 
 India's foreign policy, organized at different institutions. Scholars and other
  experts 
 were invited to the Ministry for panel discussions. Indian Ambassadors visiting
  Delhi 
 for consultations were requested to hold discussions with officers of the Divis
 ion. 
   Within the Division, a special cell has been set up to look after matters rel
 ating to 
 people of Indian origin settled abroad. The information processed by the cell i
 s utilised 
 in improving cultural contacts between India and overseas Indians.

<br><br> Jan 01, 1981 
<br><br>  
 CHAPTER XI 
  
<br><br> EXTERNAL PUBLICITY 
  
  <br><br> The External Publicity Division of the Ministry is responsible for the overal
 l tasks, 
 of publicity affecting India's foreign relations. It also coordinates and super
 vises the 
 press, public relations, publicity and cultural work done by Indian Missions ab
 road. 
 The Division briefs and assists the Missions to interpret all aspects of India'
 s foreign 
 policy to the public and the media of the countries of their respective accredi
 tation. 
 They are also kept informed of the political, economic, social and cultural dev
 elopments 
 in India in a manner so as to make foreign countries and people interested in d
 eveloping 
 and expanding relations with India. 
  
  <br><br> Against the background of the deteriorating international situation as reflec
 ted 
 through increased great power rivalry leading to a reversal of the process of d
 etente, 
 and developments in South-West Asia and South-East Asia, especially the supply 
 of 
 sophisticated arms to Pakistan and the triggering of an arms race in the sub-co
 ntinent, 
 the Division gave a correct interpretation and projection of these developments
 . 
  
  <br><br> The thrust of external publicity activities by the Division moved from "image
 " 
 building. to projection of national "interests". The Division made special effo
 rts to 
 project India's firm commitment to democracy, non-alignment and world peace, es
 ta- 
 blishment of a new international economic order, using nuclear energy for peace
 ful 
 purposes, the peaceful utilisation of outer space, moral and material support t
 o majority 
 rule in Namibia and Zimbabwe and the objectives of the UN in upholding peace an
 d 
 security in this world. The dangers to regional security as a result of arms ai
 d to Pakis- 
 Stan, and India's sincere hope of having friendly and prosperous neighbours, we
 re spe- 
 cifically projected by the Division. 
  
  <br><br> Liaison work with other government departments, especially with the Ministry 
 
 of Information and Broadcasting, and the AIR and Doordarshan, was intensified. 
 
 The intensified interaction between the Ministry of External Affairs and the Mi
 nistry 
 of Information and Broadcasting has been at two levels. At the Ministerial leve
 l, the 
 Minister of External Affairs and the Minister of Information and Broadcasting, 
 held 
 periodic meetings to evaluate the progress made. At these meetings, principles 
 and 
 guidelines were evolved which were then taken up at the official level. At the 
 level of 
 officials, a committee of officials on External Publicity was constituted. It c
 onsists of 
 officers belonging to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Informa
 tion and 
 Broadcasting, AIR and Doordarshan. This committee implements the decision taken
  
 by the Ministerial Committee and gives advice and suggestions for improving the
  External 
 Services Broadcasts of the AIR. Further, the Joint Secretary in charge of the X
 P 
 Division, held regular briefings for AIR External Services and for rendering su
 ggestions 
 for improvements. 
  <br><br>pg49<br><br>
  
   A continuous critical evaluation of the functioning of the XP Division made b
 y 
 the Parliament, public and the Ministers, helped the Division in discharging it
 s functions 
 and tasks with purpose and flexibility, in spite of limitations in terms of res
 ources and 
 manpower. 
  
 <br><br>  Some of the criticisms made were (i) that the the External Publicity network 
 did 
 not have sufficient resources and modern equipment to undertake effective publi
 city, 
 (ii) the Division had not drawn up an effective training programme and had not 
 acquired 
 adequate manpower resources for specialised External Publicity work; (iii) ther
 e was 
 lack of speed and precision in communication between Headquarters and the India
 n 
 Missions abroad about Indian developments; (iv) there was need to improve the q
 uality 
 of Indian publicity material in terms of style and content; (v) there should be
  adminis- 
 trative re-organisation, so that there was specialised staff to deal with diffe
 rent aspects 
 of publicity work. 
  
  <br><br> During the period tinder review, efforts were made to rectify these deficienc
 ies and 
 shortfalls. Specialised training programmes for publicity work for Indian Forei
 gn 
 Service Officers were initiated. A proposal is being actively processed, to ope
 n new 
 publicity wings in 25 Indian Missions located in developing countries. However,
  the 
 implementation of the recommendations concerning modernisation and increase of 
 
 equipment, and the improvement in the quality of publicity material, depend upo
 n the 
 availability of finances. 
  
   During the year greater emphasis was placed on the following: 
  
   <br><br>(i) Publicity material sent to the Missions was such as was responsive to iss
 ues 
       of topical interest and to attitudes and views in different countries. Re
 quire- 
       ments of Missions in terms of photographs, slides as well as publicity ma
 terial 
       on economic, social, and cultural aspects of India, was provided on a con
 ti- 
       nuing basis. Reference books on India, as well as other material for keep
 ing 
       Missions informed, were, updated and regularly supplied. 
  
  <br><br>(ii) A phased programme to modernise and update equipment was undertaken. 
       A decision was taken to equip Indian Missions with colour TV and VCR 
       system to improve audio-visual publicity, as well as record and analyse 
 
       important broadcasts in foreign media. 
  
 <br><br>(iii) The activities of Indian Missions were monitored closely, by an improved 
 
       system of reporting. Missions were issued special guidelines about treatm
 ent 
       of Indian visitors. 
  
<br><br> Printing 
  
  <br><br> Printing of publicity material at Headquarters registered an increase during 
 the 
 year under review and as compared to 30-35 publications in the three previous y
 ears. 
 more than 65 publications were brought out by the Division. A new publication k
 nown 
 as "India Series" was introduced, containing subject matters of topical interes
 t. The 
 series is being published in the form of leaflets. The prestigious publication,
  "India, 
 Portrait of a People" was reprinted. The size and content of the Indian and For
 eign 
 Review, a regular fortnightly publication of the Division, was changed to make 
 it both 
 instereting and readable. 
  
                          <br><br>pg50<br><br>
  
<br><br> Transmissions 
  
  <br><br> Efforts were also made to improve the reception of news by Indian Missions ab
 road 
 by switching over to satellite links from the existing radio links. Out of 130 
 Indian 
 diplomatic Missions and Posts. abroad, eight in North America are being covered
  
 through satellite channel through RCA and since January 1981, twenty seven are 
 
 being covered by PTI satellite links. Twenty seven Missions are being covered b
 y trans- 
 missions through radio signals, twenty four through bi-weekly telexes and five 
 through 
 twice weekly press cables. 
  
<br><br> Visiting Journalists 
  
 <br><br>  The Division also subsidised the visits of journalists from abroad with a vie
 w to 
 projecting positively, developments in India. Such visits result in positive co
 verage 
 and provide the Division with an excellent medium, for public relations activit
 ies. 
 During the year, sixty four journalists visited India as guests of the Governme
 nt. One 
 hundred and twenty Foreign TV teams also visited India to shoot documentary fil
 ms. 
 Two hundred and sixty eight foreign journalists on professional visits to India
 , on their 
 own, were accorded all possible assistance in their work during their stay here
 . 
  
<br><br> Audio-Visual Publicity 
  
   During the year under review, 1587 prints of a number of documentary films pr
 o- 
 duced by the Films Division were sent to Missions abroad. In addition, four doc
 u- 
 mentary films on the visit of foreign VIPs. to India, and three on issues of to
 pical 
 interest, were commissioned by the Division and produced by the Films Division.
  
  
  <br><br> Twenty feature films are under circulation amongst Indian Missions for non- 
 
 commercial publicity. Five more films, purchased during the year for the same p
 urpose, 
 are being sub-titled in various foreign languages. A decision to purchase anoth
 er 
 twelve feature films has been taken. 
  
   Sanctions for the purchase of four 16 mm film projectors, and one slide proje
 ctor, 
 by Indian Missions, were issued during the year under review. 
  
   About 200 gramophone records of Indian music and the National Anthem, were 
 supplied to the Missions. 
 <br><br> 
   Over 40,000 photographs were despatched on fortnightly basis to Indian Missio
 ns 
 abroad, on matters of topical interest. In addition, about 400 exhibition-size 
 photo- 
 graphs were also despatched, besides 500 colour transparencies. Nineteen photo-
  
 graphic exhibitions were organised by the Division, in Indian Missions. 
  
  <br><br> The Division has subsidised the location of Indian correspondents be longing 
 to 
 the four Indian News Agencies, in different countries since January 1980, with 
 the objec- 
 tive of projecting news regarding India in a positive light through independent
  channels. 
 The Division subscribed to special feature news services of news agencies, and 
 commi- 
 ssioned special feature articles on various aspects of development in India, Pu
 blication 
 of special issues of Indian magazines devoted to topical themes, such as a 'Zon
 e of Peace' 
 and other aspects of India's foreign policy, was encouraged. 
  
                             <br><br>pg51<br><br>
  
   By and large, the reporting by foreign media, including items based on despat
 ches 
 by foreign correspondents stationed in India, are factual. Whenever there is a 
 deliberate 
 or mischievous slant, it is brought to the notice of the correspondent in New D
 elhi 
 by the Division, and to the notice of the concerned publication through Indian 
 dip- 
 lomatic Missions, and the correct factual position is given to them. As regards
  un- 
 favourable interpretation which, of course, is a matter of opinion, the Mission
 s try to 
 give the correct perspective by meeting the editorial management of the publica
 tion. 
 The nature of reporting by foreign media, is kept under constant review by Indi
 an 
 Missions.

<br><br> CULTURAL RELATIONS 
  
  <br><br> As in the previous years, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations continued
  to 
 function as the apex body for promoting cultural relations between India and ot
 her 
 countries. 
  
   During the year, the ICCR received 77 distinguished visitors in varied fields
  of 
 specialisation such as fine arts, literature, education, medicine and science. 
 They came 
 from the USA, UK, Australia, the USSR, Poland, GDR, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austri
 a, 
 Belgium, France, Turkey, Italy, China, Japan, South Korea, Mauritius, Malawi, G
 hana, 
 Fiji, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Guyana, Mexico and Venezuela. 
  
   <br><br>Under the programme of inviting delegations of performing arts, 25 groups wer
 e 
 received from Egypt, Italy, Austria, Sweden, France, Spain, the USSR, GDR, Czec
 ho- 
 slovakia, Bulgaria, North Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Bhu
 tan, 
 Argentina and Mexico. A Latin American troupe came for the first time. 
  
   There were also four delegations from Bhutan, of scholars, archers, students 
 and 
 officers. 
  
  <br><br> On the other hand, 51 visitors and 43 performing delegations were sent from I
 ndia 
 to different parts of the world. The individual visitors included academicians,
  educa- 
 tionists, journalists, writers, artistes, sculptors and puppeteers. Many well-k
 nown 
 Indian artistes, including dancers and musicians, gave performances in various 
 foreign 
 cities, international trade fairs and festivals. 
  
   The visit of a Qari was sponsored to Kuala Lumpur to participate in the Inter
 - 
 national Quran Reading Competition. 
  
  <br><br> The Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding for 1981 was coil-
  
 ferred jointly on Professor Gunnar Myrdal, a noted Swedish economist, and his w
 ife 
 Mrs. Alva Myrdal, a well-known diplomatist and sociologist. 
  
   Fifteen exhibitions ranging from Madhubani paintings, batiks, photographs, to
  
 Cartoons by famous Indian Cartoonists, were sent to Prague, Belgrade, Hungary, 
 
 London, Havana, Peru, Venezuela, Accra, Lisbon, New York and Canada. 
 Paintings including those by handicapped children were sent to London for displ
 ay at 
 the Exhibition of Young Artists of the Commonwealth. An exhibition of paintings
  
 and drawings by children on Mahatma Gandhi, was sent to Washington to coincide 
 
 with the Gandhi Birth Anniversary. Four exhibitions were received, of which men
 tion 
 may be made of the one by the famous Pakistani artist Sadequain, and of Chinese
  
 paintings. 
  
   <br><br>The publication committee of the Council met twice during the year. The Prime
  
 Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi, formally released the publication 'Dances of 
 the 
  
                               <br><br>pg53<br><br>
  
 Golden Hall" published by the ICCR. Journals such as the Indian Horizons, Cultu
 ral 
 News from India, Papeles de la India, Rencontre Avec I'Inde, the Africa Quarter
 ly and 
 the Hindi Quarterly were brought out on schedule. 
  
   Under the Indo-US Sub-Commission on Education and Culture, the meeting of 
 the Indian Panel of the Sub-Commission was held. Under the Programme of exchang
 e 
 of visitors, two persons were sent to the USA at the invitation of the American
  Secre- 
 tariat of the Sub-Commission. 
  
   <br><br>Two seminars were held, one on Ataturk and Nehru and the other, of Buddhist 
 
 scholars from different parts of India to consider the feasibility of setting u
 p an advanced 
 centre of Mahayan Buddhist Studies at Guntur. A delegation of Buddhist scholars
  
 from Bhutan also participated in this seminar. 
  
   <br><br>The Azad Memorial Lecture on Prem Chand--An Appraisal by a Westerner, was 
 delivered by Professor Siegfried Schulz of the Catholic University, Washington.
  
  
   Under the programme of Presentation of Books/Art Objects and Essay Competi- 
 
 tions, books were presented to about 102 universities, libraries and institutio
 ns in 35 
 countries. Dolls, models and replicas of historical monuments in India were sen
 t to 
 foreign countries for presentation to various museums and national organisation
 s. 
 About 50 countries received such gifts. Prizes comprising handicrafts, books, L
 P 
 records and other art objects were sent to the winners of the Essay Competition
 s held by 
 Indian Missions abroad. 
  
  <br><br> Orientation Courses on aspects of Indian life and culture policies and progra
 mmes, 
 economy and external relations, were held for IFS probationers as well as for a
  group 
 of American Fulbright scholars. 
  
  <br><br> The Council continued its work relating to the observation of the UN Day, PLO
  
 Day and South Africa Freedom Day. The Mission of the UN Council for Namibia, 
 led by a delegate from Cyprus, was received. The other delegates included repre
 senta- 
 tives of the SWAPO, those from the Cameroons, USSR, and India. 
  
   The Indian Cultural Centres in Fiji, Guyana and Surinam arranged film shows a
 nd 
 performances of dance and music, as well as lecture-cum-demonstrations, Hindi c
 lasses, 
 Yoga classes, plays and exhibitions. 
  
  <br><br> The Council continued to maintain Indian professors teaching subjects like In
 do- 
 logy in the Universities of Sofia (Bulgaria), Bucharest (Romania), El Colegio d
 e Mexico 
 (Mexico), Georgetown (Guyana), Havana (Cuba), Humboldt University (GDR), Port 
 
 of Spain (Trinidad) and the University of Warsaw (Poland). 
  
   The Council continued to oversee the activities of the foreign cultural centr
 es in 
 India by administering the British libraries at Bangalore, Bhopal, Lucknow, Pat
 na, 
 Pune, Ranchi, Trivandrum, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, as also the House of Soviet 
 
 Culture at Trivandrum which organised a number of film shows, lectures and 
 exhibitions aimed at projecting Soviet life and culture. Liaison was maintained
  with 
 the Max Mueller Bhavans and Alliances Francaise in India. 
  
                          <br><br>pg54<br><br>
  
   As usual, the Council received a number of foreign students under various sch
 olar- 
 ship schemes and continued to look after their welfare in India. The ICCR gave 
 16 
 scholarships for dance and music. Nineteen study tours were organised to differ
 ent 
 parts of the country. Within the frame-work of the Indo-Bangladesh Cultural Pro
 tocol, 
 signed on Dec 30, 1980, almost all the 100 scholarships offered to Bangladesh 
 
 scholars for the period 1981-82 for pursuing higher studies in India were utili
 sed. Indian 
 and Bangladeshi films were screened in film festivals held in the two countries
  during 
 the year. 
  
  <br><br> A Festival of India, a joint venture by India and the UK, will be inaugurated
  in 
 London by the Prime Minister, Shrimati Indira Gandhi in March 1982. The Indian 
 and 
 UK Prime Ministers will be the co-patrons of the Festival. There will be a seri
 es of 
 exhibitions in prestigious galleries such as the Tate Gallery. The British Muse
 um and 
 the Victoria and Albert Museum, in the fields of art, agriculture, science, ind
 ustry and 
 technology, along with performances of drama, music and dance and exhibition of
  
 Indian films. The main objective of the Festival is to bring into focus, the ri
 chness and 
 variety of the cultural heritage of India and the progress India has made in th
 e fields of 
 science, industry and technology, since independence.

 <br><br>CHAPTER XIV 
  
<br><br> PASSPORT, EMIGRATION AND CONSULAR SERVICES 
  
  <br><br> The year 1981 started with a spurt in requests for the issue of fresh passpor
 ts and 
 other related services. This trend continued throughout the year and the number
  of 
 applications for the issue of passports received at the passport offices during
  the year 
 went upto 14.73 lakhs as compared to 8.74 lakhs during 1979 and 9.52 lakhs duri
 ng 
 1980. There was thus an increase of 55 % in the workload of the passport office
 s during 
 1981 as compared to 1980. In 1981, 13.54 lakh new passports were issued, which 
 
 became the highest figure recorded so far in any given year. Similarly the numb
 er of 
 miscellaneous services rendered during the year under review was 6. 10 lakhs as
  compared 
 to 4.86 lakhs in 1980. A detailed statement showing the number of applications 
 for 
 the issue of passports and miscellaneous services received and the number of pa
 ssports 
 issued and the miscellaneous services rendered during the year 1981 is given at
  
 Appendix V. 
  
 <br><br>  The staff strength of all the Passport Offices was determined towards the end
  of 
 1980 on the basis of inflow of work during the preceding 12 months. Special tea
 ms of 
 officers and staff were, therefore, deputed to some of the Passport Offices and
  the staff 
 strength was increased by 149 additional posts, in various grades, in the Passp
 ort Offices, 
 to ensure efficient and courteous services. As a result of these efforts, the n
 umber of 
 pending passport applications was brought down to 1. 96 lakhs by the end of Nov
 ember 
 1981 as compared to 2.82 lakhs pending in the beginning of the year. 
  
  <br><br> In December the number of applications for issue of passports rose to 1,76,14
 7 
 as compared to the monthly average of 1,18,000 during the first 11 months of th
 e year. 
 This unprecedented rush for passports was mainly a consequence of the rumour th
 at 
 there might be an increase in passport fees as well as an imposition of deposit
 s. The 
 rush was contained in early 1982 after these false rumours were successfully di
 spelled by 
 the Passport Offices. Necessary steps are being taken to provide additional sta
 ff to 
 cope with this increasing demand for the issue of passports. 
   The number of Passport Offices remained at eighteen as no new Passport Office
  
 was opened during the year. However, the proposal for having a liaison office i
 n Simla 
 to cater to the needs of the people of the hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh has 
 since been 
 finalised and it is likely to be opened soon. It is proposed to review requirem
 ents of 
 additional passport offices keeping in view various factors such as workload, f
 inancial 
 implications and convenience of the public. 
 <br><br> 
   During the year, the standard of efficiency in the issue of passports and ren
 dering 
 miscellaneous services, achieved during the year 1980, was maintained by the Pa
 ssport 
 Offices, as a result of the reorganization of the work pattern in Passport Offi
 ces, and 
 through periodical inspections by the officers of the Ministry of External Affa
 irs and 
  
                            <br><br>pg57<br><br>
  
 through scrutiny of the monitoring reports received from the Passport Offices. 
 Better 
 liaison was established with the India Security Press, Nasik, in the matter of 
 printing 
 passport booklets and with the Railway Board, regarding the quick and efficient
  move- 
 ment of the printed material. 
  
  <br><br> Among some of the measures proposed to be introduced in 1982 to further impro
 ve 
 the quality of services rendered by the Passport Offices are: (i) small and han
 dier 
 passport booklet with more pages and a flexible cover; (ii) introduction of a P
 assport 
 fee postal stamp to be made available on sale at Post Offices, which would simp
 lify 
 the payment and accounting procedure, and computerised methods in the storage/ 
 
 retrieval of information relating to the passports issued. The first stage woul
 d be the 
 centralisation of vital information for regulating the issue of passports. 
  
   During the year 1981, the total revenue earned by the Passport Offices was 
 Rs. 888.93 lakhs as compared to the revenue of Rs. 552.44 lakhs in 1980. The ex
 penditure 
 incurred by the Passport Offices in India during the year was Rs. 162.02 lakhs 
 as com- 
 pared to Rs. 135.97 lakhs in 1980. 
  
 <br><br>  With a view to removing inconvenience to Indian passengers going abroad, the 
 
 system of emigration checks was discontinued at the international exit points w
 ith effect 
 from 1 November 1980 and all Passport Offices in India were authorised to give 
 suitable 
 endorsements. In the case of passports already issued before Nov 01, 1980, spec
 ial 
 counters were opened in all Passport Offices for such endorsements in the passp
 orts. 
 However, in respect of cases which needed emigration clearance, the intending e
 migrants 
 were required to go to one of the seven Protectors of Emigrants in India, for e
 migration 
 purposes. 
  
  <br><br> With effect from 1 August, the subject of emigration as contained in the Indi
 an 
 Emigration Act, 1922 which concerns the emigration of skilled, semi-skilled and
  unskilled 
 workers, was transferred from this Ministry to the Ministry of Labour following
  an 
 amendment of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules 1961. Howev
 er, 
 all the Passport Offices would continue to give endorsements such as "Emigratio
 n check 
 required" as well as "Emigration check not required" depending upon the categor
 y of 
 the applicant as before, at the time of issue of passports. 
  
   During the period under review, Indian Missions abroad extended financial ass
 is- 
 tance to 67 Indian nationals who had got stranded abroad. In the previous year,
  the 
 number of such stranded persons who received help was 73. The number of destitu
 te 
 Indians repatriated from abroad, however, jumped to 630 from 473 during l980. T
 here 
 was a sharp increase in the number of deaths of Indian nationals in foreign cou
 ntries 
 in 1981, the number being 814 as compared to 463 in 1980. The question of settl
 ement 
 of claims and/or death compensation was taken up with the concerned foreign aut
 horities 
 on behalf of the next of kin of the deceased and 114 such cases were settled du
 ring the 
 the year under review. 
  
  <br><br> The number of documents requiring attestation/authentication by the Ministry 
 
 before submission to the foreign governments/embassies, continued to increase. 
 While 
  
                             <br><br>pg58<br><br>
  
 71,008 and 1,03,892 documents were authenticated in the years 1979 and 1980 res
 pecti- 
 vely, the number rose to 1, 10,008 during 1981. 
  
   Cases of 194 Indian nationals arrested in various countries were reported to 
 the 
 Government. All possible consular assistance was given to them and where possib
 le, 
 their release and return to India were arranged by the Missions concerned.

   Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao continued as the Minister of External Affairs. There 
 
 was no change at the level of Foreign Secretary and Secretary. At the level of 
 Additional 
 Secretary, Shri J.R. Hiremath took over as Additional Secretary (Admn) and Dr. 
 J.S.

  <br><br> The total strength of the IFS (A) &amp; (B) Cadres both at Headquarters and abroa
 d, 
 was 3684 out of which 1226 were officers. The total staff strength is given at 
 Appendix 
 VI. 
  
 <br><br>  To project India's image abroad, safeguard its national interests and impleme
 nt 
 national policies, there are 130 Missions and Posts abroad, manned by 720 offic
 ers and 
 2636 non-diplomatic officials, of which approximately 1300 are locally recruite
 d emplo- 
 yees. 
 <br><br> 
   A list detailing number of officers who have qualified in various languages i

 at Appendix VII. 
  
   Global inflationary trends showed no signs of declining during the year. It w
 as, 
 therefore, considered necessary, to implement further, administrative and finan
 cial 
 reforms and also to take effective follow-up action on the reforms introduced d
 uring 
 the previous year. A number of steps were undertaken to streamline the rules re
 lating 
 to posting of personnel abroad. The most prominent reforms in this direction we
 re 
 the implementation of the new Children's Education Allowance scheme, rules gove
 rning 
 Home Leave Fares and Emergency Passages and Outfit Allowance Rules. Follow-up 
 
 action on removal of all transferable items of work from some of the larger Mis
 sions as 
 London, to effect economies, has also been undertaken. In this context, it was 
 nece- 
 ssary to formulate a fresh set of rules and regulations covering payment proced
 ures for 
 payment to foreign suppliers against international contracts. Assessment of the
  func- 
 tional effectiveness of Indian Missions to bring about optimum efficiency in th
 eir work. 
 ing, was done. Additional staff was diverted to the Missions in West Asia and N
 orth 
 Africa to cope with the increased workload due to a large scale emigration of I
 ndian 
 nationals to these areas. 
  
   <br><br>Simultaneously, the need for a Cadre Review was felt. The Ministry is current
 ly 
 working on a Cadre Review of both the IFS(A) and IFS(B) Cadres. The Cadre Re. 
 
 view is being processed on the basis of systems and transactional analysis in c
 onsulta- 
 tion with the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Personnel &amp; Administrat
 ive 
 Reforms, and along the guidelines given by the latter, in this context. 
  
   While fully conscious of the need for economy, especially in terms of foreign
  ex- 
 exchange, the increasing diversification and pressure of international diplomac
 y has 
  <br><br>pg60<br><br>
  
 made the concept of multifunctional diplomatic officers rather outdated. Functi
 onal 
 trends dictate the necessity of having full time officers with adequate support
 ing staff in 
 order that all aspects of diplomatic activity may be efficiently and effectivel
 y fulfilled. 
  
  <br><br> In accordance with the instructions from the Department of Personnel &amp; Admi- 
 
 nistrative Reforms, the Clerical Grades of IFS(B) were restructured and stagnat
 ion in 
 these Grades has been removed completely. 
  <br><br> During the financial year 1981-82, Foreign Service Inspectors conducted inspe
 ction 
 of some important Missions as those in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, USSR, Thailand, 
 
 Vietnam, Kampuchea, Laos and Singapore. 
  
   The existing scheme of payment of Daily Allowance is being rationalised. A ne
 w 
 scheme proposed by this Ministry has been accepted in principle, by the Ministr
 y of 
 Finance. Under the new scheme, which is expected to be introduced soon, a panel
  of 
 hotels will be drawn up in various countries and the Government of India person
 nel, 
 who visit these countries on official tours will be provided accommodation in t
 hese 
 hotels, according to their status. In addition, they will also be paid Cash All
 owance 
 at the prescribed rate in US Dollars. Unlike the arrangement under the existing
  Sys- 
 tem, where Cash Allowance rates differ from one country to another, Cash Allowa
 nce 
 will be fixed on a four tier basis, in accordance with the UN cost of living in
 dices. 
  
  <br><br> The Welfare Unit of the Ministry continued to look after the general welfare 
 of 
 all officials serving at Headquarters and in the Missions abroad. Grand-in-Aid 
 on an 
 ad hoc basis for the provision of recreational facilities to officers and staff
  in Missions 
 as well as in Passport Offices, was arranged in consultation with the Departmen
 t of 
 Personnel &amp; Administrative Reforms. Financial assistance out of the Staff Benef
 it 
 Fund, was provided to bereaved families and help was extended in other deservin
 g cases. 
 Employment was provided to deserving dependents of deceased officials. Assistan
 ce 
 was given to the physically handicapped. Canteen facilities at South Block, Pat
 iala 
 House and the, External Affairs Hostel, were improved. 
  
   <br><br>Vigorous follow-up action on the Five Year Property Acquisition Plan was take
 n 
 so as to reduce the Government's rental liability abroad. During the current fi
 nancial 
 year, an amount of Rs. 11 crores has been earmarked for the acquisition and con
 s- 
 truction of property abroad. 
  
  <br><br> The total establishment expenditure of all Missions abroad has, on account of
  the 
 various administrative reforms and property acquisition drives, been kept at a 
 reason- 
 able amount of Rs. 50 crores. The expenditure at Headquarters is about Rs. 7 
 crores. Details are given in Appendices VIII &amp; IX. 
  
   India's contribution to the various international Organisations is of the ord
 er of 
 Rs. 3.5 crores, while technical and economic aid, extended to various third wor
 ld coun- 
 tries has been of the order of Rs. 60 crores. 
  
   A Special Cell continued to function to watch and monitor the progress of imp
 le- 
 mentation of the reservation order in respect of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
  Tribes.

 <br><br>CHAPTER XVI 
  
<br><br> USE OF HINDI IN OFFICIAL WORK 
  
   In accordance with the Government's policy regarding the use of Hindi in offi
 cial 
 work, every effort was made both in the Ministry and Missions/Posts abroad to i
 mple- 
 ment the provisions of the Official Language Act and the Rules made thereunder.
  Apart 
 from the use of Hindi as the Union Official Language, vigorous efforts were mad
 e to 
 popularise Hindi in foreign countries, particularly in the areas where a large 
 segment 
 of the population comprises people of Indian origin. 
  
   <br><br>The Official Language Implementation Committee of the Ministry kept a close 
 
 watch on the actual implementation of the policy of increasing the use of Hindi
  in official 
 work. Such committees are already functioning satisfactorily, in some of the la
 rger 
 Indian Missions. The Regional Passport Offices have also been asked to establis
 h 
 Official Language Implementation Committees and to submit their reports to the 
 
 Ministry. 
  
  <br><br> In order to ensure fuller implementation of the Official Language Rules in th
 e 
 Ministry, RPOs and Missions/Posts abroad, suitable check points were evolved du
 ring 
 the year under report and were circulated to all concerned to ensure that the g
 eneral 
 orders are issued both in Hindi and English. 
  
 <br><br>  During the year, the Committee of Parliament on Official Language inspected 
 
 Regional Passport Offices at Delhi, Calcutta, Patna, Bhubaneswar and Ahmedabad.
  At 
 their suggestion, all the RPOs have been directed to have at least one Hindi ty
 pewriter 
 and one Hindi typist in their offices. A proposal is under consideration for th
 e creation 
 of the posts of Hindi Officer/translator etc. in Regional Passport Offices at D
 elhi, 
 Lucknow, Patna, Calcutta, Bhopal, Jaipur, Chandigarh and Bombay. 
  
   It has also been decided to set up a special cell in the Hindi Section of the
  Ministry 
 to compile a "Diplomatic glossary" to cope with the translation of new words an
 d expres- 
 sions that are increasingly finding their way into the jargon of international 
 relations. 
 It is essential to have at the disposal of the Hindi Section, standard Hindi eq
 uivalents 
 while translating international agreements. 
  
  <br><br> The process of equipping Indian Missions/Posts abroad with Hindi typewriters,
  
 English-Hindi dictionaries, help books, standard Hindi books for libraries as w
 ell as 
 for the children, and rubber stamps/sign boards went apace. Hindi typewriters h
 ave 
 been supplied to almost all the Missions/Posts abroad and steps have been taken
  to train 
 and send typists knowing Hindi typing to the Missions/Posts abroad. Efforts are
  also 
 being made to create more posts of Hindi Officers for Indian Missions/Posts abr
 oad. 
  
  <br><br> The demand for Hindi magazines/newspapers in many foreign countries, parti- 
 
 cularly those that have a large number of people of Indian origin, increased ma
 nyfold. 
  
                         <br><br>pg62<br><br>
  
 Under the Newspaper Exchange Programme, Hindi newspapers/magazines were 
 exchanged on a regular basis. A start has been made to issue important publicat
 ions 
 in Hindi. The speeches of the Minister of External Affairs, delivered in Pakist
 an and 
 Nepal, were published in the form of booklets in Hindi. 
  
   Hindi classes for children continued to be held in more than 20 of the Indian
  
 Missions abroad. 
  
   In pursuance of the Ministry's programme of popularising Hindi, a get-togethe
 r 
 in honour of Hindi writers from Fiji, Mauritius, Hungary, Britain, Poland and t
 he GDR, 
 was organised in Delhi. Besides local writers, poets and journalists, some Memb
 ers 
 of Parliament participated in the function. Hindi books/Hindi typewriters and H
 indi 
 help literature were supplied to local voluntary organisations/universities in 
 foreign 
 countries. 
  
   <br><br>The Committee of Parliament on Official Language visited and inspected the 
 Ministry. On this occasion, an exhibition depicting the various documents prepa
 red 
 in Hindi and efforts made to popularise Hindi abroad was also organised. The pr
 ess 
 and other mass media commented favourably on this effort.
