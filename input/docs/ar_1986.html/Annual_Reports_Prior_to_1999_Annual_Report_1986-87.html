<tr><td>Peace, disarmament and development continued to be the main  
thrusts of India's foreign policy during the year. The principles  
   of non-alignment, the struggle for emancipation from all forms of  
   colonialism and the promotion of friendship with all countries,  
   particularly neighbours, continued to inspire its conduct. 
<br> 
<br>   The Non-aligned Movement was naturally an important focus of  
   India's diplomatic efforts. As Chairman of the Movement till  
   September India strove to expand the areas of consensus, keep  
   negotiations alive in matters of controversy and suggest a  
   constructive path in dealing with the major issues facing the  
   world community. India's efforts to advance the cohesion and  
   sense of purpose of the Movement were widely acclaimed. In  
   preparation for the Eighth Summit Conference at Harare the  
   Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau was held in New  
   Delhi to review progress on political and economic matters. The  
   Harare Summit summed up the results achieved and laid down the  
   lines of future advance. It reaffirmed the Movement's concern for  
   a new international economic order, stressed the need for greater  
   South-South co-operation by approving the Action Programme on  
   Economic Co-operation drawn up in Delhi in April and endorsed the  
   establishment of a Standing Ministerial Committee on Economic  
   Relations for a dialogue between the North and the South. 
<br> 
<br>   As was to be expected, the Harare Summit devoted its main  
   attention to the crisis in Southern Africa caused by the  
   aggressive racism of the Pretoria regime. An Action for Resisting  
   Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund was established  
   with a nine-member Fund Committee with India as Chairman to  
   assist the Frontline States and the liberation movements to  
   resist the onslaughts of the apartheid Pretoria regime. A Summit  
   meeting of the Africa Fund Committee Member-States was held in  
   New Delhi in January 1987. The Plan of Action adopted by the  
   Summit delineated seven areas of priority assistance to the  
   Frontline States, the mobilisation of public opinion and  
   financial resources. Contributions amounting to US $ 70 million  
   have already been pledged to the Fund which includes India's own  
   contribution of Rs. 50 crores over a period of three years. 
<br>-IV&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The struggle against apartheid remained a central element of  
   India's foreign policy during the year. The visits of the Prime  
   Minister to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Tanzania in May 1986  
   highlighted the value we attach to bilateral relations with these  
   countries as well as underline India's solidarity with them in  
   regard to the liberation struggle in South Africa and Namibia. In  
   its capacity as the then Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement  
   India co-sponsored, along with the Organisation of African Unity,  
   a World Conference on Sanctions against racist South Africa in  
   Paris in June 1986. That the evils of racism and colonialism  
   persist in South Africa due to the sustenance provided by some  
   Western powers was also made clear by the Prime Minister at the  
   meeting of the Heads of Government of the seven Commonwealth  
   countries in London in August. The meeting considered the report  
   of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group on South Africa and  
   endorsed a call for sanctions against the Pretoria regime. 
<br> 
<br>   Another prominent focus of India's efforts during the year was  
   the urgent need for disarmament. In pursuance of the Six-Nation  
   Initiative the leaders of Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Tanzania,  
   Sweden and India met at Ixtapa in Mexico in August and urged the  
   United States and the Soviet Union to agree on a moratorium on  
   nuclear weapon testing and suggested concrete steps to assist in  
   achieving adequate arrangements for verification. General  
   Secretary Gorbachev announced his full support of this proposal.  
   President Reagan while declaring that a Comprehensive Test Ban  
   Treaty remained a long-term objective, indicated that the United  
   States found it necessary to continue nuclear testing and would  
   not accept the offer of verification. 
<br> 
<br>   We were, however, glad to observe that at Reykjavik, President  
   Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev came very close to  
   reaching agreement that could pave the way for complete  
   elimination of all nuclear weapons. 
    
      <br>The efforts of the six nations continue despite disappointment  
   that repeated conduct of nuclear weapon tests by the United  
   States has now resulted in the Soviet Union withdrawing its  
   moratorium and resuming tests. Disarmament issues were also  
   discussed during the visit to Delhi in November of the General  
   Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Mr. Mikhail  
   Gorbachev. The Prime Minister and the General Secretary signed  
   the Delhi Declaration on principles for a non-violent world free  
   of nuclear weapons. The Declaration reflects a completely fresh  
approach in the nuclear 
 
    
   world in which non-violence plays a central role. It is India's  
   hope that the declaration will receive the endorsement of the  
   international community. 
<br>-V&gt;<br> 
<br>   Another area of particular attention during the year concerned  
   relations with South East Asian and Pacific countries. India's  
   traditionally good relations with the countries of the  
   Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) received an  
   impetus with the visit of the Prime Minister to Indonesia and  
   Thailand in October 1986. The mutual desire on the part of these  
   countries to develop closer bilateral relations with India was  
   manifested in the spontaneous and extremely warm reception  
   accorded to the Prime Minister during the visit. The Prime  
   Minister's visit to Australia and New Zealand in October 1986  
   marked a fresh stage in India's relations with these countries.  
   New areas of co-operation were identified and bilateral economic  
   relations are expected to expand in the coming years. The visit  
   resulted in a determination of all the countries visited and  
   India to look more towards one another rather than to the outside  
   world. 
<br> 
<br>   In India's immediate neighbourhood regional co-operation in  
   South Asia was an area of enhanced activity during the year.  
   Several meetings of Ministers, experts and officials were held,  
   culminating in the Second Meeting of the Heads of Government of  
   the SAARC in Bangalore in November 1986. It was decided to  
   establish a SAARC Secretariat as well as technical committees on  
   the prevention of drug trafficking and abuse, and on women in  
   development. The Heads of Government also decided to co-operate  
   regularly on international economic issues, to review annually  
   the situation of children in their countries, to initiate a South  
   Asian broadcasting programme, to facilitate tourism, to co- 
   operate in educational programmes and to organise a corps for  
   rural development. The SAARC Secretariat was established in  
   Kathmandu in January 1987. Urgent steps are being taken to  
   implement the other decisions taken at the Summit Conference in  
   Bangalore for which purpose India, as current Chairman, has a  
   particular responsibility. 
<br> 
<br>   Efforts to improve relations with Pakistan met with negative  
   developments with Pakistan's continuing assistance to terrorists  
   in India, persistence in their programme to develop nuclear  
   weapons, their search for sophisticated weapons, including an  
   AWACS type capability, attempts to raise the Kashmir question at  
   international fora and their reluctance to develop trade on a  
   non-discriminatory basis. The situation was further aggravated by  
   the provocative and threatening 
<br>-vi&gt; 
<br> 
<br>build-up of Pakistani forces on the Punjab border in January  
   1987. Talks were initiated by India to defuse the tension created  
   by these troop movements and a time-table of withdrawals and  
   further dialogue have been drawn up. India's emphasis throughout  
   this period was on the need for all differences to be sorted out  
   through peaceful negotiation. 
<br> 
<br>   With Bangladesh friendly relations were strengthened. In July  
   1986 President Ershad visited India in his capacity as Chairman  
   of SAARC. The Joint Committee of experts to study the common  
   water resources of the two countries is still to complete its  
   work and has been given an extension till May 1987. The influx of  
   Chakma refugees, however, into Tripura and their reluctance to  
   return has given rise to problems that need urgently to be  
   resolved. 
<br> 
<br>   The continuing ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka remains a source of  
   concern. The number of refugees from that country continues to  
   grow amounting to about 130,000 by the end of 1986. In April 1986  
   in response to the Sri Lanka Government's desire that India's  
   good offices be revived Shri P. Chidambaram, Minister of State  
   for Personnel and Administrative Reforms, visited Colombo and as  
   a result of his discussions with the Sri Lanka authorities  
   certain proposals emerged. The Government of India felt that  
   these deserved serious consideration by the Tamil Groups and, on  
   this basis, the TULF resumed negotiations with the Sri Lanka  
   Government. However, the proposals which emerged did not cover  
   the question of linkage between the Northern and Eastern  
   provinces. At the time of the SAARC Summit in Bangalore the Prime  
   Minister and President Jayewardene discussed the issue and as a  
   result Shri P. Chidambaram and Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister of  
   State for External Affairs, visited Colombo for further  
   discussions. New proposals were formulated but the Sri Lanka  
   Government's adherence to these proposals has been in doubt. The  
   situation since then in the Tamil areas has taken a turn for the  
   worse and the prospect of resuming negotiations remains  
   uncertain. 
<br> 
<br>   With Nepal and Bhutan relations continued to strengthen in all  
   areas. Several projects aided by India are under various stages  
   of implementation. 
    
     <br><br> The visit of the Prime Minister to the Maldives in February  
   1986 gave fresh impetus to the close relations with that country.  
   An Agreement on Economic 
   <br>-vii&gt; 
    
<br>and Technical Co-operation signed during the visit provides for  
the establishment of a Joint Commission to promote bilateral co- 
operation in the economic and technical spheres. 
 
<br><br>With Burma, existing cordial relations have been strengthened  
with the signing, during the official visit of the Minister for  
   External Affairs Shri N. D. Tiwari in December 1986, of an  
   agreement on the delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the  
   Andamans Sea, in the Coco Channel and in the Bay of Bengal. 
<br> 
<br>   India's bilateral relations with Afghanistan continue to  
   develop satisfactorily. On the economic front, most of the  
   decisions of the Seventh Indo-Afghan Joint Commission have been  
   implemented. On the political front, in a stand at once  
   consistent and principled, India continues to be opposed to both  
   intervention and interference in Afghanistan. Convinced that  
   there can be no military solution of the Afghan problem, and  
   deeply interested in the sovereignty, non-alignment and  
   independent status of Afghanistan, India stands for a political  
   settlement in Afghanistan that takes into account the legitimate  
   interests of the parties concerned. India thus supports the  
   initiative of the UN Secretary General. 
<br> 
<br>   The escalation of the military presence of the great powers in  
   the Indian Ocean and the heightened tension in the area has been  
   a matter of deep concern. India remains firmly committed to the  
   total elimination of all foreign military presence from the  
   Indian Ocean region and the complete dismantling of bases and  
   other facilities used by outside powers in the area. 
    
<br><br>   India's relations with the three countries of Indo-China  
retained their high level of cordiality. The Minister for  
   External Affairs Shri N. D. Tiwari led a high-level delegation to  
   Vietnam including the Ministers of State for Petroleum and  
   Natural Gas, Shri Brahm Dutt, for External Affairs Shri K. Natwar  
   Singh and for Expenditure, Shri B. K. Gadhvi in January 1987. An  
   agreement, in principle, providing for co-operation in the field  
   of oil between Vietnam and India was signed during the visit.  
   Under the Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation (ITEC)  
   Programme of this Ministry Indian experts have been deputed to  
   Laos, Kampuchea and Vietnam. Presently a team of consultants are  
   preparing feasibility studies on small scale industries in Laos  
   and experts from the 
<br>-viii&gt; 
<br><br> 
   Archaeological Survey of India are working in Kampuchea on the  
restoration of the famous temple of Angkor Wat. 
<br> 
<br>   India's stand on the Kampuchean issue was made clear by the  
   Prime Minister during his visits to Indonesia, Thailand,  
   Australia and New Zealand. 
    
<br> <br>  The efforts of the Government of India to improve relations  
with the People's Republic of China and secure a fair and  
   satisfactory settlement of the boundary issue were adversely  
   affected by the Chinese intrusion into the Sumdorong Chu Valley  
   area of the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh. This  
   development was not in consonance with the understanding between  
   the two countries to maintain peace and tranquility along the  
   border. India also rejected the Chinese objection to the  
   conferment of Statehood to Arunachal Pradesh. While the boundary  
   question remains crucial to full normalisation of relations, our  
   exchanges with China in the fields of commerce and culture,  
   science and technology have gradually developed over the year and  
   resulted in a better understanding of each other's position in  
   regard to the boundary and on other bilateral and international  
   issues. It is necessary for this dialogue to continue. The  
   Government of India continues to hope that the principles of  
   peaceful co-existence will guide relations between the two  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Relations with Japan continued to be cordial. Studies and  
<br>surveys calculated to increase the scope of Japanese assistance  
   and investment have been initiated. There is also greater mutual  
   recognition of the global and regional roles of the two  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>   During the visit in March 1986 of the Prime Minister of the  
   Republic of Korea (ROK) an economic package, comprising increased  
   export of iron-ore, development of the Paradeep port and ships  
   orders/bulk cargo sharing was decided upon. Subsequent  
   promotional measures are being adopted to diversify and balance  
   trade between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   A number of high-level visits between India and the Democratic  
   People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have fostered cultural contacts  
   besides exploring possibilities of increasing trade exchanges. 
<br>-ix&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   A State Commission has been established in Mongolia to promote  
   bilateral relations with India in the economic, commercial and  
   other fields. 
<br> 
<br>   In West Asia, India's consistent policy of moral and material  
   support to the people of Palestine remained unchanged. At the  
   conference of Non-aligned Countries in Harare India gave full  
   support to the call for an International Peace Conference on the  
   Middle East. Relations with Jordan were substantially expanded  
   with the visit of their Majesties the King and Queen of Jordan;  
   and this is particularly noticeable in the economic field.  
   However, the continuance of the war between Iraq and Iran, both  
   countries having traitionally warm and friendly relations with  
   India, is a matter of considerable concern. Efforts to bring  
   about an end to this fractricidal war have, however, not so far  
   met with success. 
<br> 
<br>   In North Africa, India joined other Non-aligned Countries in  
   demonstrating solidarity with Libya when, in April, Tripoli was  
   bombed. There was close political co-operation, with Algeria both  
   bilaterally as well as in the international arena. This was  
   matched by enhanced trade and economic co-operation. 
<br> 
<br>   Special efforts were made to intensify relations with the  
   countries of Southern Africa. The Prime Minister, accompanied by  
   high-powered delegations, visited the Frontline States of Zambia,  
   Zimbabwe, Angola and Tanzania in May 1986, thus highlighting not  
   only the value attached to bilateral relations with these  
   countries but also to emphasise India's solidarity with them in  
   regard to the liberation struggle in South Africa and Namibia.  
   India entertained visits from President Oliver Tambo of the  
   African National Congress (ANC) and from President Sam Nujoma of  
   the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) in May 1986.  
   During his visit Mr. Nujoma formally opened the SWAPO Embassy in  
   Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   A resident Indian diplomatic mission at Embassy level was  
   opened in Luanda, Angola, in September 1986. A Mission is also  
   being opened in Gaborone, Botswana, in the near future. With the  
   establishment of these Missions, India would have resident  
   diplomatic representation in all the Six Frontline States of  
   Southern Africa. Bilateral assistance to Frontline States was  
   also enhanced. Thus India has offered Zambia a Government credit  
   of Rs. 100 million and a 
<br>-x&gt; 
<br> 
<br>credit by financial institutions of Rs. 150 million. Agreements  
   on trade and on economic, technical, scientific and cultural co- 
   operation have been signed with Angola. Medicines worth nearly  
   Rs. 6 lakhs were gifted to Mozambique. Assistance was also  
   provided to the SWAPO Mission in New Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   India's relations with countries of Western Europe remain  
   cordial. The twelve members of the European Community remain our  
   major trading partners. In addition, the Scandinavian countries  
   continue, as in the past, their economic aid for projects in the  
   field of social welfare, health and rural development. Several  
   high-level visits, including that of the President of India to  
   Greece and of the Vice President of India to France, and of the  
   President of Finland, of Chancellor Kohl of the FRG, and of the  
   Prime Ministers of Turkey, Italy and Denmark to India added  
   greater economic and commercial content to our bilateral  
   relations with these countries. 
<br> 
<br>   The governments in Western Europe have generally been  
   responsive to India's concern regarding anti-Indian activities in  
   their countries. The Government of India has been monitoring  
   these activities and has been in constant touch with the  
   governments concerned. With Britain, relations in this respect  
   offer scope for improvement. The British authorities have,  
   however, taken some action in convicting or bringing to trial  
   some extremists or terrorists in the UK. Meanwhile, on an  
   Extradition Treaty, two rounds of talks have already taken place  
   and discussions are continuing. Britain's refusal to join the  
   other members of the Commonwealth in imposing effective sanctions  
   against South Africa, resulted in the boycott of the Commonwealth  
   Games at Edinburgh in July 1986 by a number of Commonwealth  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>   The mutually beneficial bilateral relations between India and  
   the socialist countries in Eastern Europe continue to develop  
   satisfactorily. Exchange of high-level visits with the USSR  
   culminating in the State visit of General Secretary Gorbachev  
   served to reaffirm the dynamic and stable character of Indo- 
   Soviet relations. Agreements for expanding trade, economic and  
   technical co-operation with the Soviet Union on an enhanced scale  
   were concluded as well as a protocol for holding Festivals in  
   each other's country. The official visit of the President of  
   India, Giani Zail Singh, to Poland in November, the visit of the  
   then Minister for External Affairs Shri P. Shiv Shanker to  
   Bulgaria in June and ministerial and official level visits  
   exchanged with Czechoslovakia, Hungary 
<br>-xi&gt; 
<br> 
<br>and the GDR contributed to strengthening bilateral relations with  
   all these countries. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi also had  
   fruitful discussions on bilateral and international issues with  
   Czechoslovak Prime Minister Strougal in Prague. 
<br> 
<br>   India and Yugoslavia have a close, friendly and multifaceted  
   bilateral relationship in diverse fields. Relations were furthers  
   trengthened during the year with the visit of the Yugoslav Prime  
   Minister Branko Mikulic to India in July August and of the  
   President of India to Yugoslavia in October/November 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   With the United States, a sustained dialogue is being  
   maintained for enhancing relations in the fields of commerce,  
   scientific co-operation and the transfer of technology. The new  
   procedures under the Memorandum of Understanding have enabled the  
   clearance of the transfer of several computer systems. On  
   political matters, there have been high-level exchanges of view  
   to improve mutual understanding. 
<br> 
<br>   Canada and India continued to maintain a close dialogue on  
   bilateral and international issues. The Canadian law enforcement  
   agencies took vigorous steps to meet the threat of terrorism  
   posed by extremist elements based in Canada. The Canadian  
   authorities initiated legal action against extremists and  
   terrorists conspiring to commit violence against India. An  
   Extradition Treaty was signed during the visit of Canadian  
   Secretary of State for External Affairs Mr. Joe Clark in  
   February, as also a Memorandum of Understanding on Industrial and  
   Technological collaboration. 
<br> 
<br>   The visit of President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua to India in  
   September and the signing of three agreements on that occasion  
   gave special emphasis to India's concern regarding the problems  
   of Central and South America. 
<br> 
<br>   Relations with Peru have been greatly strengthened by the  
   State visit of the Peruvian President, Dr. Alan Garcia Perez in  
   January 1987. During the visit an agreement was concluded  
   envisaging co-operation between the two countries in various  
   fields of culture. 
<br> 
<br>   Developing countries have become increasingly aware of the  
   advantage of fostering close economic co-operation among  
   themselves for mutual benefit. The 
<br>-xii&gt; 
<br> 
<br>concept of Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  
   (ECDC) has been given added urgency due to the continuing  
   deterioration in the world economic climate. A major development  
   in ECDC was the Second High Level Meeting on Economic Co- 
   operation among Developing Countries in Cairo in August 1986.The  
   meeting reaffirmed the relevance of ECDC and reiterated the  
   pivotal role of South-South co-operation. The meeting approved,  
   among others, the Cairo Declaration on ECDC, which recommended,  
   inter alia, that the scale of priorities be outlined for the  
   selection of programmes and projects to be implemented within a  
   fixed time-frame. It was also decided to ensure that the ECDC  
   become self-generating and self-financing. 
<br> 
<br>   A special Ministerial Meeting of the Contracting Parties of  
   GATT held at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 recorded  
   its determination to halt and reverse protectionism and remove  
   distortions in trade. It was agreed that the question of services  
   would be taken up separately outside the framework of GATT. 
<br> 
<br>   India continues to promote economic and technical co-operation  
   with developing countries in the spirit of South-South co- 
   operation. Besides providing assistance under multilateral  
   schemes, India has provided bilateral assistance to developing  
   countries through the Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation  
   (ITEC) Programme operated by the Ministry of External Affairs.  
   The ITEC Programme launched in 1964 with an outlay of Rs. 4.64  
   lakhs has expanded to Rs. 9 crores in 1986-87 covering nearly 60  
   countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministry of External Affairs also assisted foreign  
   governments in recruiting Indian experts on a bilateral basis. It  
   also made its contribution towards the promotion of Indian  
   economic interests through its representation in international  
   bodies. 
<br> 
<br>   Indians overseas are increasingly being recognised as a  
   potential bridge of understanding and co-operation. They in turn  
   have evinced greater interest in developing their cultural and  
   economic ties with India to which the Government of India has  
   responded positively with due regard for the mutual benefit of  
   India and of the host country. The Government of India has set up  
   a Consultative 
<br>-xiii&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Committee for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). This Committee  
   comprises representatives from the Ministries of Finance,  
   Commerce, Industry and External Affairs, the India Investment  
   Centre, representatives of trade and industry and NRIs from  
   different regions of the world who will be represented by  
   rotation. Through this Committee the NRIs interested in  
   investment and collaboration in India will be in a better  
   position to represent their views. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review, the External Publicity Division  
   of the Ministry made concerted efforts, as part of its basic  
   policy, to project the various dimensions of our foreign policy.  
   Emphasis was laid on dissemination of information in a persuasive  
   manner to achieve optimum results. Audio-visual and printed  
   material was widely disseminated and particular attention was  
   given to personal briefings and contacts with opinion makers. The  
   principled positions taken by India on major global and regional  
   issues facing mankind were made known, particularly the  
   challenges in the path of stability and progress of South Asia  
   where a fifth of humanity resides.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>India continued its efforts to foster relations of friendship,  
   co-operation and mutual understanding with the neighbouring  
   countries of South Asia and maintained high-level contacts to  
   accomplish that purpose. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review, the Government of India sought  
   to strengthen the existing friendly ties between India and  
   Bangladesh. There were several meetings at the highest level  
   between the leaders of India and Bangladesh. In July 1986  
   President Ershad of Bangladesh paid a visit to India in his  
   capacity as Chairman of SAARC and during his meeting with the  
   Prime Minister of India extensive discussions were held on  
   bilateral issues. 
<br> 
<br>   In pursuance of an agreement reached between the Prime  
   Minister of India and President Ershad in October 1985 at the  
   CHOGM in the Bahamas, a Joint Committee of Experts (JCE) was  
   constituted in November 1985 to study the common water resources  
   of India and Bangladesh within a period of 12 months. The JCE  
   could not complete its work in the stipulated time and it was  
   decided, at the Prime Minister's meeting with President Ershad  
   during the SAARC Summit in Bangalore in November 1986, to extend  
   its term by six months. 
<br> 
<br>   The then Minister for External Affairs of India, Shri P. Shiv  
   Shanker visited Bangladesh on 30 July 1986 to hand over the 100  
   cyclone-proof shelters constructed by India on the island of Urir  
   Char, for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of the  
   cyclone which had ravaged coastal Bangladesh in May 1985. The  
   design and construction of these shelters had been undertaken by  
   Indian engineers at a cost of about Rs. 1.5 crores which was  
   borne by the Prime Minister's Relief Fund. 
   <br>-2&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Pending a permanent solution to the Tin Bigha issue the  
Government of India had, in 1985, offered greater access to  
   Bangladesh to its enclaves of Dahagram and Angorpota. Making use  
   of this offer, in addition to a number of routine administrative  
   visits facilitated by India, the Bangladesh President and Home  
   Minister visited the enclaves in June/July 1986, the first of  
   such visits. 
<br> 
<br>   Since April 1986, there has been an influx of a large number  
   of Chakma refugees from the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh  
   into Tripura. This influx has continued since then and some  
   30,000 Chakma refugees have been housed in four refugee camps in  
   Tripura. The Government of India have been in constant touch with  
   the Government of Bangladesh, urging them to enable the early  
   repatriation of these refugees to their homeland. While the  
   Foreign Secretary of India was in Dhaka in November 1986, in  
   connection with the meeting of the Standing Committee of the  
   Joint Economic Commission (JEC), he and the Foreign Secretary of  
   Bangladesh held discussions concerning the repatriation of these  
   refugees. 
<br> 
<br>   The Minister for External Affairs, Shri N.D. Tiwari visited  
   Bangladesh from 6 to 9 January 1987. Discussions were held on  
   SAARC, and all important bilateral issues such as river waters,  
   Tin Bigha, boundary demarcation, Chakma refugees, insurgency,  
   vested properties and economic co-operation. It was agreed that  
   the Indo-Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission will meet in New  
   Delhi during the first half of 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   The continuing ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka remained a source of  
   concern to the Government. The number of refugees from Sri Lanka  
   continues to grow, with the total reaching 130,000 by the end of  
   1986. 
<br> 
<br>   Though there were frequent setbacks, the Government persisted  
   in its efforts to narrow the gap between the positions of the Sri  
   Lanka Government and the Tamil minority in order to facilitate a  
   negotiated political settlement. India's efforts remained  
   suspended in the beginning of the year as a result of the  
   rejection by the Sri Lanka Government of the TULF proposals and  
   the continuing indiscriminate violence against Tamil civilians by  
   the Sri Lanka security forces. 
<br>-3&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   In April 1986, the Sri Lanka Government conveyed through its  
Foreign Minister its desire to revive India's good offices. A  
   delegation led by Shri P. Chidambaram, Minister of State for  
   Personnel and Administrative Reforms, visited Colombo at the end  
   of April and had detailed discussions with the Sri Lankan  
   authorities. Flowing from these discussions a package of  
   proposals emerged which the Government felt deserved serious  
   consideration of the Tamil groups as a basis for resuming  
   negotiations with the Sri Lanka Government. 
    
<br><br>  On the basis of these proposals, the TULF had two rounds of  
   negotiations with the Government of Sri Lanka in July and August  
   1986. Based on these discussions, the Sri Lanka Government  
   prepared and forwarded a set of detailed proposals for the  
   creation of provincial councils and devolution of powers on them.  
   These proposals, however, are still not acceptable to the Tamil  
   militants as they do not address the crucial question of linkage  
   between the Northern and the Eastern provinces. 
<br> 
<br>   Further efforts to overcome this hurdle were made at meetings  
   between the Prime Minister and President Jayewardene during the  
   SAARC Summit in Bangalore in November 1986 and subsequent visits  
   by Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri K. Natwar Singh  
   and Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri P. Chidambaram, to  
   Colombo in November and December 1986. As a result of discussions  
   between the two Ministers of State and President Jayewardene in  
   Colombo during the last visit, new proposals emerged for  
   resolving the issue of the status of the Eastern province,  
   especially the question of linkage. Immediately, after the  
   Ministers' return from Colombo, however, the Sri Lankan  
   authorities sent word that they would not find it possible to  
   proceed with the proposals agreed to by them in Colombo. 
<br> 
<br>   Thereafter the situation took a turn for the worse, with the  
   Tamil groups announcing their own administrative arrangements in  
   certain fields in Jaffna area and the Sri Lanka Government  
   imposing an economic blockade of the Jaffna peninsula and  
   launching military attacks against the Tamil militants. These  
   measures have resulted in great suffering and hardship for the  
   civilians in Jaffna. 
<br> 
<br>   Though further measures to break the impasse were discussed  
   with the Sri Lankan authorities, especially during the visit of  
   Lands Minister Gamini 
   <br>-4&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Dissanayake to Delhi on January 14-15, 1987, the Sri Lankan  
response remains ambiguous and the possibility of resuming the  
   peace process uncertain. 
<br> 
<br>   India's relations with the Maldives received an impetus with  
   the Prime Minister's official visit to the Republic of Maldives  
   from 7 to 9 February 1986. During the visit, an Agreement on  
   Economic and Technical Co-operation was signed between the two  
   countries. This Agreement provides for the setting up of a Joint  
   Commission to promote bilateral co-operation in the economic and  
   technical spheres. A package of assistance and co-operation  
   amounting to Rs. 21 crores was announced at the end of the visit.  
   Under this package programme India will assist the Maldives in  
   the setting up of a hotel training school, a 200-bed hospital  
   with a specialised cardiac centre, and the use of INSAT  
   facilities. India shall also extend the services of experts and  
   provide scholarships for Maldivian students in India. Apart from  
   bilateral relations, developments in South Asia and SAARC were  
   also discussed. 
<br> 
<br>   The Minister for External Affairs of India, Shri N. D. Tiwari,  
   paid an official visit to Burma from 22 to 25 December 1986. A  
   bilateral Maritime Boundary Agreement was signed between the two  
   countries on 23 December 1986 on the delimitation of the Maritime  
   Boundary in the Andamans sea, in the Coco Channel and in the Bay  
   of Bengal. The visit is likely to enhance bilateral relations  
   between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Relations between India and Nepal continued to strengthen in  
   all areas during the year under review. The President paid a  
   State visit to Nepal from 21 to 25 July 1986. The warm welcome  
   accorded to him was an eloquent testimony to the close relations  
   between the two countries. The President had fruitful discussions  
   with the King of Nepal and various aspects of bilateral relations  
   formed subjects of official discussions at different levels  
   during the visit. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the King of  
   Nepal met twice in Harare in September 1986, and in Bangalore in  
   November 1986. These meetings provided an opportunity for a frank  
   and friendly discussion of all aspects of bilateral relations.  
   The co-operation between the two countries within the SAARC  
   framework also had a beneficial impact on bilateral relations. 
<br>-5&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Economic co-operation between the two countries continued to  
   intensify. Indian-aided projects under various stages of  
   implementation included the construction of the Western Sector of  
   the Mahendra Raj Marg, the establishment of a Museum Library-cum- 
   Documentation Centre at the Institute of Forestry, Hetauda, the  
   supply of sophisticated medical equipment for, and training of,  
   medical personnel of the Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, the supply of  
   iodised salt and assistance in the setting up of iodisation  
   plants, and a Rural Electrification project. During the visit  
   from 9 to 13 December 1986 to India by the Nepalese Minister of  
   State for Finance and Industry, the two countries agreed to  
   promote the establishment of Indo-Nepal joint ventures in Nepal.  
   It was also decided that the standby credit extended by India to  
   Nepal would be increased from Rs. 15 crores to Rs. 25 crores. A  
   new project for setting up a small scale Industrial Estate at  
   Rajbiraj was agreed upon during the visit to Nepal of the  
   Minister for External Affairs Shri N. D. Tiwari in January 1987.  
   An Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation was also concluded  
   during this visit. 
<br> 
<br>   The traditionally close and friendly relations between India  
   and Bhutan were further strengthened during the year under  
   review. The NAM Summit in Harare in September and the SAARC  
   Summit in Bangalore from 15 to 17 November offered an opportunity  
   for discussions on subjects of mutual interest at the highest  
   level between the King of Bhutan and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.  
   Both meetings were marked by close identity of views on matters  
   of mutual interest, reflecting the relationship of trust and co- 
   operation that prevails between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   In the economic field, co-operation flourished. Units I &amp; II  
   of the Rs. 244 crores 336 MW Chukha Hydel Project were  
   successfully commissioned and power synchronised with the Eastern  
   grid of India. Besides, Thimphu and Phuntsholing, parts of West  
   Bengal and Assam have started receiving power from Chukha. The  
   remaining two units are expected to be commissioned by March  
   1988. As per the 1974 Chukha Agreement, the Government of India  
   is committed to purchase all power surplus to Bhutan's internal  
   requirements. It is proposed to extend assistance to Bhutan for  
   funding the Dungsum (Nanglam) Cement Project in Eastern Bhutan.  
   Surplus cement production from the Nanglam Plant will be supplied  
   to the North-eastern States of India. 
   <br>-6&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   It was also proposed to continue Indo-Bhutan economic co- 
operation during Bhutan's VIth Plan (1987-1992). Forming an  
   important component in the development of infrastructure in  
   Bhutan is the involvement of Indian agencies in various projects  
   of differing sizes and locations in the fields of  
   telecommunications, road building, geological exploration and  
   irrigation works etc. 
<br> 
<br>   In addition India continues to offer opportunities for  
   secondary as well as higher education, for specialised training  
   in various fields such as defence, police, customs, medicine etc.  
   India has offered scholarships worth Rs. 14 lakhs as well as  
   Colombo Plan TCS slots for this purpose. At Bhutan's request  
   India continues to supply, at controlled prices, certain  
   essential commodities such as wheat, rice, sugar, coal,  
   explosives, steel and edible oils. 
<br> 
<br>   India is committed to developing cordial, co-operative and  
   good neighbourly relations with Pakistan in accordance with the  
   letter and the spirit of the Simla Agreement. We wish to  
   encourage greater people-to-people contact between the two  
   countries and it is our earnest hope that such contacts would  
   usher in a new era of Indo-Pakistan relations. 
<br> 
<br>   The process of normalisation of relations which had been set  
   in motion following President Zia-ul-Haq's visit to New Delhi on  
   17 December 1985 was soon held up on account of Pakistan's  
   unwillingness to have non-discriminatory trade with India. It was  
   also adversely affected by Pakistan's assistance to Sikh  
   terrorists, indications of its continuing nuclear weapons  
   programme, its keenness to secure sophisticated weaponry  
   including an AWACS type capability, its attempts to  
   internationalise the Kashmir issue despite the fact that  
   President Zia-ul-Haq had earlier said on 17 December 1985 that  
   Pakistan wanted this issue to be resolved in accordance with the  
   Simla Agreement and at an appropriate time. 
<br> 
<br>   Notwithstanding these unfortunate developments, the Prime  
   Minister of India, during his meeting with Prime Minister Junejo  
   at Bangalore on 16 November 1986, agreed that our Home Secretary  
   and Foreign Secretary should visit Pakistan in December 1986 with  
   a view to exploring possibilities for reviving the normalisation  
   process. In pursuance of this understanding, the Home Secretary  
   and Foreign Secretary visited Pakistan as scheduled and had a  
   wide ranging 
<br>-7&gt; 
<br> 
<br>exchange of views with their counterparts. During the Home  
Secretary's visit it was decided to set up two committees-one to  
   evolve fresh border ground rules and the other to curb drug  
   trafficking and smuggling. 
    
<br><br>However, during January 1987 tension on the Indo-Pakistan  
   border was aggravated on account of the Pakistani forces having  
   moved to provocative and threatening positions. Accordingly, an  
   invitation was sent to Pakistan on 25 January at the Prime  
   Minister's initiative for talks in Delhi for defusing the  
   situation. As a result of these talks, which were held from 30  
   January to 4 February 1987, a series of measures were agreed upon  
   in this regard. India's initiative in this matter demonstrates  
   its desire to live in peace and good neighbourly relations with  
   Pakistan, as also its determination to strengthen peace in South  
   Asia. 
<br> 
<br>   South Asian regional co-operation received further impetus  
   with the holding of the second South Asian Association for  
   Regional Co-operation (SAARC) Summit in Bangalore from 15 to 17  
   November 1986. The Summit was preceded by the preparatory  
   meetings of the second session of the Council of Ministers, the  
   seventh session of the Standing Committee of Foreign Secretaries,  
   and the second session of the Programming Committee consisting of  
   senior officials. Prior to these, a number of meetings were held  
   in new areas of co-operation proposed by the Heads of State or  
   Government at the first Summit in 1985. Thus in 1986 a  
   Ministerial Meeting on International Economic Issues was held in  
   Islamabad in March-April; a Ministerial Meeting on `Women in  
   Development' was hosted by India in Shillong in May; the Study  
   Groups on Terriorism and on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse met  
   in Dhaka in June and September respectively; an Expert Group  
   Meeting on Terrorism was held in September; the SAARC Conference  
   on South Asian Children in co-operation with UNICEF was held in  
   New Delhi in October; and the Working Group on the establishment  
   of the Secretariat met in Dhaka also in October to work out the  
   modalities of launching the SAARC Secretariat. In addition, the  
   first session of the Council of Ministers preceded by the  
   meetings of the Standing Committee and the Programming Committee  
   was also held in Dhaka in August 1986, which approved the  
   establishment of the Regional Meteorological Research Centre, and  
   the Regional Agricultural Information Centre. 
<br> 
<br>   The results of these meetings were consolidated in the  
   decisions of the Summit, at the end of which the Bangalore  
   Declaration, the Joint Press Release, and the Report of the  
   second session of the Council of Ministers were adopted. A 
<br>-8&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Memorandum of Understanding on the establishment of the SAARC  
   Secretariat was signed by the Foreign Ministers in the presence  
   of the Heads of State or Government. The Summit welcomed the  
   establishment of two new Technical Committees under the  
   Integrated Programme of Action-one on Prevention of Drug  
   Trafficking and Drug Abuse and the other on Women in Development.  
   They decided to include, in the expanding ambit of co-operation,  
   annual reviews by the Standing Committee of the situation of  
   children in SAARC countries and agreed that SAARC countries co- 
   operate regularly in international economic fora to promote their  
   objectives there. 
<br> 
<br>   A number of significant measures were undertaken to effect  
   organisational improvements in conducting activities under SAARC.  
   Draft Rules of Procedure for the meetings of the Technical,  
   Programming and Standing Committees and those of the Council of  
   Ministers were adopted as guidelines as an interim measure,  
   pending their finalisation; guidelines for financing the  
   institutional costs of regional institutions were worked out and  
   measures for streamlining the implementation of SAARC activities  
   adopted. A Calendar of Activities comprising over 100 events is  
   being currently implemented. 
<br> 
<br>   The second SAARC Summit was considered a success. India played  
   an active role announcing a contribution of Rs. 15 million for  
   1987-88, and hosting a number of important SAARC meetings. The  
   Chairmanship of SAARC is to remain with India until the next  
   Summit in late 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   The SAARC Secretariat was launched on 16 January 1987 in  
   Kathmandu. The Minister for External Affairs, Shri N. D. Tiwari,  
   led the Indian delegation to the inauguration of the Secretariat. 
    
<br> <br>  The Heads of State/Government had directed that the following  
ideas be examined by March 1987; the launching of a South Asian  
   Broadcasting Programme; the establishment of a SAARC  
   Documentation Centre; the institution of SAARC Fellowships; the  
   facilitation of tourism in the region and the launching of an  
   organised volunteer's programme. Accordingly, India convened an  
   Expert Group meeting on "New Ideas" in February 1987 in New Delhi  
   and detailed schemes for implementation of these ideas were drawn  
   up. 
<br>-9&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review India's bilateral relations with  
   Afghanistan continued to develop satisfactorily. A mid-term  
   review meeting of the Indo-Afghan Joint Commission on Economic  
   Trade and Technical Co-operation was held in Kabul in June 1986.  
   It was a matter of satisfaction to both sides that most of the  
   decisions of the Seventh Indo-Afghan Joint Commission had been  
   implemented. The work on the construction of an additional  
   Surgical Ward and a Polyclinic at the Indira Gandhi Institute of  
   Child Health, Kabul, which is a prime symbol of Indo-Afghan co- 
   operation, was started. India continued to provide assistance to  
   Afghanistan in several areas including Public Health, industrial  
   development and education. 
<br> 
<br>   India is deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan  
   which has affected our security environment. India's stand on  
   Afghanistan is consistent and principled. India continues to be  
   opposed to both intervention and interference in Afghanistan. In  
   our view, there can be no military solution of the Afghan  
   problem. We are deeply interested in the sovereignty, non- 
   alignment and independent status of Afghanistan. We stand for a  
   political settlement in Afghanistan that takes into account the  
   legitimate interests of the countries concerned. In this context,  
   we support the initiative of the UN Secretary General. 
<br> 
<br>   The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Mr. Abdul Wakil paid an  
   official visit to India at his own initiative from 7 to 10  
   February 1987. The visit was primarily to brief the Government of  
   India on the national reconciliation moves initiated in  
   Afghanistan and to have consultation with us prior to the next  
   round of the Proximity Talks. 
<br> 
<br>   India has also taken note of the recent Afghan-Soviet  
   initiatives designed to facilitate a political settlement of the  
   Afghan issue. It is our hope that speedier progress will be made  
   in the oximity Talks and a political settlement will be reached  
   expeditiously. 
<br> 
<br>   The increasing military presence of the great powers in the  
   Indian Ocean and the heightened tension in the area has been a  
   matter of deep concern for the Government of India. The military  
   presence in the Indian Ocean area of extra-regional powers, has  
   led to a spiralling arms race which exacerbates regional  
   tensions. The formation of military command structures which  
   encompass the 
<br>-10&gt; 
<br> 
<br>region negates the decision of the UN General Assembly to declare  
   the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. 
<br> 
<br>   India remains firmly committed to the total elimination of all  
   foreign military presence from the Indian Ocean region and the  
   complete dismantling of bases and other facilities used by the  
   great powers in the area. Reports have been received that, in  
   addition to the upgradation of already existing military bases,  
   further facilities are being sought in India's immediate  
   neighbourhood which would lead to deterioration in our security  
   environment. The Government of India continues to hope that  
   countries in the Indian Ocean region would not enter into  
   military alignments with extra-regional powers.

<tr><td>India's traditionally good relations with the countries of the  
   Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) received fresh  
   impetus with the visit of the Indian Prime Minister to Indonesia  
   and Thailand in October 1986. The visit filled the long felt need  
   to give more attention to this region. The mutual desire on the  
   part of these countries to develop closer bilateral relations  
   with India was manifested in the spontaneous and extremely warm  
   reception accorded to the Prime Minister during his visit. 
<br> 
<br>   Wide ranging exchange of views with President Soeharto of  
   Indonesia and Prime Minister General Prem Tinsulanonda of  
   Thailand on various regional and international issues have  
   resulted in better understanding of our respective positions. The  
   talks were held in a very cordial atmosphere and reflected a  
   shared perception on major international issues. On the bilateral  
   front, it was agreed to expand and diversify co-operation in  
   various fields and to step up the level of trade and economic  
   exchanges. A Protocol on Co-operation in Science and Technology  
   was signed between the Indian Council of Scientific and  
   Industrial Research and the Thailand Institute of Scientific and  
   Technological Research. It was also agreed to have increased  
   interaction in the field of science and technology with Indonesia  
   and to conclude an Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation  
   soon. The Minister for External Affairs Shri N. D. Tiwari, paid a  
   visit to Bangkok from 21 to 22 December 1986 as part of the  
   followup of decisions taken during the Prime Minister's visit to  
   Thailand. An Instrument of ratification on the convention for  
   Avoidance of Double Taxation with Thailand was exchanged during  
   the visit. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand visited  
   India in March 1987. 
<br>-12&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   At the fifth session of the India-Malaysia Joint Committee  
   which was held in New Delhi on 30-31 October 1986, bilateral  
   trade and commercial relations including participation in  
   projects, co-operation in development of small scale industries,  
   joint ventures, and trade promotional measures were reviewed. It  
   was agreed to take measures to correct the imbalance of trade  
   which continues to remain in Malaysia's favour. Dr. Mahathir  
   Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia, paid an official visit from  
   29 January to 1 February 1987. The delegation included the  
   Foreign Minister and the Secretary General of the Ministry of  
   Foreign Affairs of Malaysia. Dr. Mahathir and the Prime Minister  
   had a useful exchange of views on various international and  
   regional issues. Steps to strengthen bilateral co-operation and  
   trade were discussed. 
<br> 
<br>   There was a regular exchange of trade delegations between  
   India and Singapore. Mr. Lee Boon Yang, Minister of State for  
   Trade and Commerce visited India in October 1986 to inaugurate  
   the office of the Singapore Trade Development Board in Bombay.  
   The Federation of the Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry  
   (FICCI) during the visit of its delegation to Singapore in  
   November 1986, established a Working Group with the Singapore  
   Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
    
<br><br>   With the assumption of power in the Philippines by President  
Corazon Aquino a new atmosphere of greater bilateral co-operation  
   and understanding has been generated. A number of agreements in  
   the fields of agriculture, science and technology and economic  
   and technical co-operation are being negotiated. 
    
     <br> <br>India's existing friendly relations with Australia and New  
Zealand got a further impetus with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's  
   visit to these countries in October 1986. An Indian Prime  
   Minister visited these countries after a gap of nearly two  
   decades. The visit thus signalled a new emphasis on India's  
   relations with this part of the world. 
   <br>-13&gt; 
 
<br><br>The Prime Minister was received with warmth and spontaneity in  
both countries. The visits resulted in a better understanding of  
each other's perspectives on various world issues. A Science &amp;  
   Technology Agreement with Australia and Agreements on Trade and  
   on Avoidance of Double Taxation with New Zealand were signed  
   during the Prime Minister's visit. Bilateral trade came under  
   close examination in the official talks. It was decided that  
   efforts would be made to bring about a more balanced growth of  
   trade. Australia and New Zealand indicated their interest in  
   specific areas of co-operation-Australia in the coal and mining  
   sectors; and New Zealand in afforestation, agriculture and  
   tourism. A Coal Delegation from Australia visited India to  
   discuss details of possible co-operation in this sector. A Trade  
   Delegation from Australia also came to New Delhi for the annual  
   Joint Trade Committee (JTC) talks. Apart from strengthening  
   existing exports, we have identified new thrust areas for  
   exports. 
<br> 
<br>   A high-level delegation from Australia is likely to visit  
   India in early 1987 to examine the whole gamut of bilateral  
   economic relationship. 
<br> 
<br>   During the Prime Minister's visit, a delegation from the  
   Associated Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry of India (ASSOCHAM)  
   also visited Australia. A Joint Business Council (JBC) was formed  
   between ASSOCHAM and the Confederation of Australian Industries  
   (CAI), which is expected to give an impetus to trade between the  
   private sectors of the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   A Cultural Exchange Programme was finalised with Australia in  
   August 1986. 
    
<br>   During 1986 there were many high-level visits to the area:  
   Shri K.C. Pant, Minister for Steel &amp; Mines, visited Australia in  
   July; Shri H.K.L. Bhagat, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs,  
   visited New Zealand at the head of a Parliamentary Delegation in  
   September; New Zealand's Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Ann  
   Hercus, visited India in April 1986. An Australian Parliamentary  
   delegation and Joint Services Staff College study team visited  
   India in November 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Fiji, Dr. James  
   Maraj, presented his credentials to the President of India in  
   September 1986 as the Island 
<br>-14&gt; 
<br> 
<br>country's first ever Non-Resident High Commissioner to India.  
   During this visit bilateral relations were reviewed. During the  
   then Secretary (East)'s visit to Fiji in 1985, it was decided  
   that economic and technical co-operation with Fiji would be  
   stepped up. Action aimed at co-operation in various areas, e.g.  
   cottage industries, marble cutting, provision of doctors,  
   industrial exhibition etc., has been initiated. Fiji has sought  
   India's help in other areas such as building of tourism  
   infrastructure as well as joint ventures. 
<br> 
<br>   India provided relief to the cyclone ravaged Solomon Islands  
   in the form of medicines worth Rs. 5 lakhs. 
<br> 
<br>   India's relations with the three countries of Indo-China  
   retained their high level of cordiality. In the political sphere,  
   India's stand on the Kampuchean issue was made clear by the Prime  
   Minister during his visits to Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand  
   and Thailand. The need to create an atmosphere conducive to a  
   settlement was emphasized, as it was our conviction that the  
   genocidal Pol Pot elements should be excluded from any  
   settlement. 
<br> 
<br>   Implementation of the Indian Technical &amp; Economic Co-operation  
   (ITEC) programme of this Ministry, which is the main vehicle for  
   providing technical assistance, was considerably improved in  
   1986. To Laos for instance, 55 large irrigation pump-sets were  
   supplied as gifts from the Government of India, and a team of  
   consultants were deputed for preparing feasibility studies on  
   small scale industries. A team of senior geologists from India  
   also visited Laos in order to make a preliminary survey of potash  
   deposits in that country. Relief medicines were also supplied. 
<br> 
<br>   The year also saw a marked improvement in the utilisation of  
   ITEC scholarships by the nationals of the Peoples' Republic of  
   Kampuchea. Experts from the Archaeological Survey of India began  
   work in Kampuchea on the restoration of the famous temple of  
   Angkor Wat. This work too is being financed out of the ITEC  
   programme. Relief supplies of medicines were supplied to  
   Kampuchea. 
<br>-15&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Implementation of the decisions taken at the Second Session of  
   the India-Vietnam Joint Commission was effective. A large number  
   of Vietnamese experts have received training in various Indian  
   institutions and Indian experts have been deputed to Vietnam. Two  
   Research Centres, one for animal husbandry and forage and the  
   other on rice, which had been started under the ITEC programme in  
   Vietnam, have begun to function smoothly. 
    
<br><br>   The Minister for External Affairs, Shri N.D. Tiwari led a  
high-level delegation including the Ministers of State for  
   Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Brahm Dutt, for External Affairs,  
   Shri K. Natwar Singh and for Expenditure, Shri B. K. Gadhvi to  
   Vietnam from 9 to 12 January 1987. The delegation had useful  
   discussions with the Vietnamese leadership. An Agreement, in  
   principle, providing for co-operation in the field of oil between  
   India and Vietnam was signed. A fresh Government of India credit  
   of Rs. 10 crores and a gift of Rs. 1 crore was also announced  
   during the visit. 
<br> 
<br>   High-level visits this year included those by the Kampuchean  
   Minister for Information and Culture, Mr. Cheng Phon, during  
   April-May 1986, and by India's Minister for Health and Family  
   Welfare, Smt. Mohsina Kidwai, to Vietnam in June 1986.

   in a peaceful and fair manner. 
<br> 
<br>   The Seventh Round of Official Level Talks was held in Beijing  
   from 21 to 23 July 1986. On the boundary question, substantive  
   discussions which were initiated at the Sixth Round of Talks in  
   New Delhi in November 1985, were continued on the Eastern and  
   Western Sectors of the boundary. Although the discussions were  
   inconclusive, a better perception of each other's views was  
   obtained. A programme of exchanges in the field of Science and  
   Technology was finalized. The implementation of the Cultural  
   Exchange Programme was also reviewed. Both sides exchanged views  
   on the international situation. 
<br> 
<br>   India's deep concern over the Chinese intrusion in the  
   Sumdorong Chu Valley area of the Tawang District of Arunachal  
   Pradesh was conveyed to Acting Chinese Premier Wan Li and Foreign  
   Minister Wu Xueqian also during the Seventh Round of Talks. It  
   was stressed that such intrusions added to tension and vitiated  
   the atmosphere for the achievement of a just and satisfactory  
   solution to the boundary question. The subject of the Chinese  
   intrusion was also taken up at the meeting between the then  
   Minister for External Affairs Shri P. Shiv Shanker, with the  
   Chinese Foreign Minister in New York on 18 September 1986. The  
   Chinese side was informed that this recent irritant involving the  
   boundary question was not in consonance with the wishes of the  
   peoples of the two countries. 
<br>-17&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   While exchanges in the fields of trade, culture and science  
   and technology have grown, the crucial question of the boundary  
   still remains to be solved. The Government of India has  
   consistently emphasized to the Chinese Government that it is  
   necessary for both sides to find a solution to problems that  
   arise along the boundary through peaceful consultations and in a  
   manner that ensures the maintenance of peace and tranquility all  
   along the border. To this end, India also stressed that the  
   Chinese side should do nothing to aggravate matters and disturb  
   the status quo. 
<br> 
<br>   The Government of India also rejected the adverse Chinese  
   reaction to the conferment of Statehood to Arunachal Pradesh as a  
   clear interference in India's internal affairs, and as entirely  
   contrary to China's professed desire for a peaceful settlement of  
   the boundary question. India expressed the hope that the five  
   principles of peaceful co-existence will continue to guide  
   relations between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Under the official Exchange Programme, a number of delegations  
   were exchanged between the two countries in such fields as  
   education, student scholarships, carpet technology, etc. The  
   Chinese Vice Minister for Education, Liu Zhongde, led their  
   Education Delegation to India. The President of the Supreme  
   People's Court of China, Zheng Tianxiang, visited India at the  
   invitation of the Chief Justice of India. 
<br> 
<br>   Mr. Li Beihai, Council Member of the Chinese Association for  
   International Understanding, led a 5-member delegation on a visit  
   to India from 28 November to 6 December 1986, at the inviation of  
   the V. K. Krishna Menon Memorial Society. Mr. Jiang Guang Hua,  
   Deputy head of the International Liaison Department (ILD) of the  
   Chinese Communist Party, led a 5-member ILD delegation to visit  
   India from 19 to 31 December 1986, at the invitation of the  
   CPI(M). The delegation also had discussions with Congress-I  
   leaders at New Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   In respect of Japan, the mutually friendly and co-operative  
   relations received fresh momentum with the visit of our Prime  
   Minister to Japan in 1985. There were increased exchanges in  
   cultural, commercial, economic, scientific and technological  
   fields between the two countries. 
<br>-18&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Japan continued to be India's third largest trading partner  
   though accounting for only 7 to 8% of our total trade turnover.  
   Our efforts were geared at diversifying exports to Japan while  
   maintaining, and wherever possible increasing exports of  
   traditional items like marine products, mineral ores, tea, spices  
   etc. The scope for increasing exchanges in the commercial field  
   was discussed during the India-Japan bilateral trade talks at  
   Tokyo in June 1986. At New Delhi, in December 1986, the 19th  
   Joint Meeting of the India-Japan Business Co-operation Committee,  
   discussed promotional measures in trade, investments, joint  
   ventures and collaborations. It was noted that though Japanese  
   investment in India has been increasing, it remains marginal and  
   does not reflect the potentialities. A number of Japanese survey  
   missions, sponsored by important Japanese companies including the  
   Bank of Tokyo, visited India to assess the economic situation and  
   the possibilities of co-operation and interaction. Conversely a  
   number of Indian delegations, official and non-official, in the  
   economic, commercial and other fields from the Chambers of  
   Commerce, the Export Promotion Councils, and from Public Sector  
   Undertakings also visited Japan. 
    
<br><br>   In a follow-up action on the Projects for Indo-Japanese co- 
operation identified during the visit of the Prime Minister of  
   India to Japan, feasibility studies and surveys were conducted to  
   determine the scope of Japanese assistance. Notes were exchanged  
   for the special credit of Yen 30 billion for the gas-based power  
   project in Assam and for the grant assistance of Yen 1.973  
   billion for the Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Medical Institute at  
   Lucknow. Japanese delegations visited India for carrying out  
   feasibility studies for the modernisation of railways, the IISCO  
   Burnpur Plant and the textile industry. Japanese Yen credit for  
   the financial year 1986-87 of Yen 48.443 billion represented an  
   increase of about 23.5% over the credit of Yen 39.231 billion  
   extended by Japan for 1985-86. Japan thus emerged as the second  
   largest donor to India on a bilateral basis. 
<br> 
<br>   The India-Japan Committee on Science &amp; Technology which held  
   its first meeting in New Delhi in September 1986, identified more  
   than ten areas for possible co-operation and interaction. During  
   the year under review, exchanges under other institutional  
   arrangements in science were also carried out. 
<br> 
<br>   Smt. Pupul Jayakar, Chairman, Festival of India and Adviser to  
   the Prime Minister on Culture, visited Japan in October 1986 to  
   discuss with Government officials and with various Japanese  
   sponsors, the events and venue of the Festival 
   <br>-19&gt; 
<br> 
<br>of India in Japan in 1988. Japanese delegations also visited  
India to discuss the Festival of India in Japan and the Japan  
   Month in India. 
    
<br>   The visit of Smt. Krishna Sahi, Minister of State for  
   Education and Culture to Japan in October 1986 on the occasion of  
   the inauguration of the granite stone relief depicting the life  
   of Buddha, in Nara Prefecture, reflected the abiding historical  
   and cultural links between Japan and India. 
<br> 
<br>   There were a number of Ministerial level visits from India to  
   Japan in 1986 which included the visits of Shri N.D. Tiwari as  
   Minister for Industry in August and as Minister for External  
   Affairs in November; of Shri K.C. Pant, Minister for Steel and  
   Mines in June; and of Smt. Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, Minister of  
   State for Welfare in August. Also Prof. M.G.K. Menon, Member,  
   Planning Commission, Shri V.C. Shukla, President of the Indian  
   Olympic Association (IOA), Shri S. Venkitaramanan, Finance  
   Secretary, Capt. W.A. Sangama, Chief Minister of Meghalaya and  
   other senior officials from the Centre and from the States, as  
   well as a number of MPs and State legislators and a National  
   Defence College team visited Japan during the period under  
   review. 
<br> 
<br>   From Japan too, delegations, official and non-official, and an  
   increasing number of tourists visited India. 
<br> 
<br>   Official-level bilateral consultations between the Foreign  
   Ministries of both countries which were held at New Delhi in  
   December 1986, were comprehensive and reflected the recognition  
   of the important regional and global roles of both countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Follow-up action on the economic package decided upon during  
   the visit in March 1986 of the Prime Minister of the Republic of  
   Korea (ROK) comprising of the increased export of iron-ore,  
   development of Paradeep Port and ships orders bulk cargo sharing,  
   was taken with a view to enhancing the economic content of the  
   India-ROK bilateral relations. Promotional measures were  
   undertaken for diversified and balanced trade between India and  
   the ROK such as visits of business delegations from India,  
   participation in the Seoul International Trade Fair in September  
   1986, the holding of the India-ROK Joint Business Council Meeting  
   in July 1986 at Seoul and the organising of exhibitions. 
   <br>-20&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   India participated in the 10th Asian Games at Seoul in  
September-October 1986. About 600 persons including the Indian  
   contingent, Members of Parliament, State legislators, Press  
   correspondents, and official media representatives visited Seoul.  
   The Indian official delegation was led by Smt. Margaret Alva,  
   Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports. Shri H.L. Kapur,  
   Lt. Governor of Delhi and Shri V.C. Shukla, IOA President also  
   visited Seoul. A 19-member Manipuri dance troupe and a 15-member  
   Himachal Pradesh dance troupe participated in the opening  
   ceremony of the Games. 
<br> 
<br>   Twenty three paintings of Indian modern art were sent for  
   exhibition in the Contemporary Asian Art Show. A photography  
   exhibition entitled "In the Footsteps of Buddha" was organised in  
   the ROK in April 1986. The Indian film entry 'MAYURI' won a prize  
   in the 'Asia Pacific Film Festival' held at Seoul in September  
<br>1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The former Chief Justice of India, Shri P.N. Bhagwati, and  
   Shri H.R. Bhardwaj, Minister of State for Law and Justice,  
   visited Seoul to participate in the International Law Association  
   Conference in August 1986. Shri K.C. Pant, Minister for Steel and  
   Mines, paid an official visit on invitation. A 14-member National  
   Defence College team visited the ROK in September 1986. There  
   were visits from the ROK to India at the official level. Business  
   and sports delegations from the ROK also visited India. During  
   his visit to India in August 1986, Mr. Soc-Gil Park, Assistant  
   Minister for Foreign Affairs, exchanged views with us on  
   important bilateral relations and on international issues. 
<br> 
<br>   An Indian Parliamentary delegation led by Shri Shivraj Patil,  
   the then Minister of State, visited the Democratic People's  
   Republic of Korea (DPRK) in June 1986, on invitation. Minister of  
   State, Smt. Margaret Alva, led the Indian delegation to the  
   Second General Conference on Physical Education and Sports of the  
   Non-aligned Countries held in Pyongyang in July 1986. The Mayor  
   of Delhi Shri Mahinder Singh Saathi visited the DPRK in September  
   1986. Several Parliamentarians and academicians from India also  
   visited Pyongyang on invitation from cultural and social  
   organisations in the DPRK. 
<br>-21&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   A number of DPRK delegations visited India to explore the  
   possibility of increasing trade exchanges between the two  
   countries. A deal for the supply of 100,000 tons of wheat from  
   India against the supply of zinc from the DPRK was finalised.  
   India also agreed to supply 273,000 tons of wheat to the DPRK  
   under an arrangement with the Soviet Union. 
<br> 
<br>   A State Commission was established in Mongolia with a view to  
   promoting bilateral relations with India in the economic,  
   commercial and other fields. During the visit of the Mongolian  
   Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Olzvoi, to India in September 1986,  
   views were exchanged on important international issues and on  
   matters of mutual interest including Mongolia's guest status in  
   the Non-aligned Movement (NAM). The Mongolian Foreign Minister  
   Mr. M. Dugersuren also exchanged views on these matters with our  
   Minister for External Affairs in New York in September 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   Shri Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi, Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha,  
   visited Mongolia on the occasion of the 19th Congress of the  
   Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in May 1986.  
   Delegations of CPI and of CPI(M) from India also attended the  
   MPRP Congress. 
<br> 
<br>   India extended assistance under the Indian Technical and  
   Economic Co-operation (ITEC) programme of this Ministry for the  
   production of a document-ary film on Mongolia in English for  
   which a team from the Films Division of India visited Mongolia in  
   July-August 1986.

<tr><td>India's relations with the countries in the West Asia and  
   North Africa (WANA) region have been characterised by warmth and  
   friendship. The process of consolidation and diversification of  
   these ties continued through 1986. India has been consistent and  
   steadfast in its support of the Arab cause and for a  
   comprehensive, just and durable settlement of the West Asia  
   problem. 
<br> 
<br>   India continues to offer its moral and material support to the  
   Palestinian people. It extended its support to the Non-aligned  
   Movement (NAM) call at the Harare Summit for convening of an  
   International Peace Conference on West Asia as a means to resolve  
   this problem. 
<br> 
<br>   The situation in Lebanon continues to be grim with no end in  
   sight to the continued factional fighting. India hopes that good  
   sense will prevail and a solution will emerge soon to bring this  
   tragedy to an end. 
<br> 
<br>   The US bombing of the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi in  
   April 1986 was strongly condemned by the Government of India both  
   bilaterally and in its capacity as Chairman of the Non-aligned  
   Movement. The NAM Minis-terial delegation led by the then  
   Minister for External Affairs Shri B.R. Bhagat visited Tripoli  
   and New York to express solidarity with Libya. The economic  
   contents of the Indo-Libyan relations has increased substantially  
   in the last few years. The Sixth Session of the Indo-Libyan Joint  
   Commission on Economic and Technical Co-operation was held in New  
   Delhi in July 1986 to monitor progress of ongoing co-operation  
   and to identify fresh areas for increased bilateral co-operation. 
   <br>-23&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   India and Algeria continue to have close political co- 
operation both bilaterally and in the international arena. There  
   has already been a marked increase in the economic and commercial  
   co-operation between the two countries. The Algerian Vice- 
   Minister for Co-operation visited India in March 1986 in order to  
   prepare the ground for the third session of the Joint Commission  
   Meeting which was held in Algiers in July 1986. The Minister of  
   State for Railways, Shri Madhav Rao Scindia, had also visited  
   Algeria in April 1986. During his visit an Agreement on Co- 
   operation in the Railway sector was signed. The third session of  
   the Indo-Algerian Joint Commission had agreed to set an annual  
   trade turnover target of US $ 100 million, which will be a five- 
   fold in-crease in trade over the previous year. The Joint  
   Commission also identified co-operation possibilities in various  
   sectors, most notably in ralways, industry, hydraulics,  
   fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. 
<br> 
<br>   Following our recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic  
   Republic (SADR) in October 1985, an SADR Embassy has started  
   functioning in New Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   We were privileged to host their Majesties the King and Queen  
   of Jordan on a State visit to India in October 1986. A high- 
   powered delegation had accompanied their Majesties and the  
   bilateral exchanges held are expected to boost Indo-Jordanian  
   relations-both in the political and economic fields. Indo- 
   Jordanian economic co-operation has already witnessed a marked  
   increase. Jordanian imports from India are expected to increase  
   substantially in the current year. 
<br> 
<br>   Contacts with other countries in the region were maintained at  
   various levels. Efforts were made to strengthen and intensify co- 
   operation in areas of mutual interests. The then Minister of  
   State for External Affairs, Shri K.R. Narayanan, visited Cairo in  
   August 1986 to attend a high-level meeting on Economic Co- 
   operation amongst Developing Countries of the Group of 77. He  
   also had bilateral talks with the Egypitan officals covering  
   political and economic matters. A multi-disciplinary inddustrial  
   delegation led by the Minister of State for Industrial  
   Development, Shri N. Arunachalam, visited 
<br>-24&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Tunisia in October 1986. The team identified mutually beneficial  
   reas of co-operation in selected commercial and industrial  
   fields. These include exports for non-traditional commodities and  
   possibilities for joint ventures in small industries,  
   communications and the power sectors. The Somalian Minister for  
   Commerce and Industry had visited India in July 1986, during  
   which Agreed Minutes were signed for co-operation in the  
   industrial field. The implementation of the Agreed Minutes would  
   raise the possibility of increasing export of Indian goods and  
   expertise to Somalia. 
<br> 
<br>   Opportunities for maintaining high-level contacts with WANA  
   countries were also availed of during the NAM Co-ordinating  
   Bureau Meeting in New Delhi in April 1986 and also during the  
   Harare Summit in September 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   Ten countries of the Gulf region, namely, Iran, Iraq, Saudi  
   Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain,  
   Qatar, the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic  
   Republic of Yemen (PDRY), come under the ambit of the Gulf  
   Division of this Ministry. Our friendly and cordial relations  
   with these countries have continued to improve in diverse fields.  
   Contacts with the Gulf countries have been maintained by high- 
   level visits and meetings. The Firance Minister of India visited  
   Saudi Arabia where he went as a leader of the Inian delegation to  
   the second meeting of the Indo-Saudi Joint Commission held in  
   Riyadh in April 1986. The Minister of State for Industry led a  
   delegation to Iran in December 1986 and the Minister for Human  
   Resource Development visited the UAE in December 1986. At the  
   official level, Secretary (Steel) visited Iran in September 1986  
   in connection with the Kudremukh Iron Ore Project. 
<br> 
<br>   The Iranian Foreign Minister visited India in August 1986 for  
   bilateral talks. This was followed by the visit of an Economic  
   delegation from Iran in September 1986 to discuss the question of  
   a barter deal in oil against import of goods from India. Because  
   of divergence of views on the ratio of oil imports from Iran to  
   be linked to Indian exports, no agreement could be reached From  
   Iraq, its permanent Under Secretary visited India in June 1986  
   before the Harare Summit for bilateral discussions. The Iraqi  
   Minister for Oil led the 
<br>-25&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Iraqi delegation to the tenth session of the Indo-Iraq Joint  
   Commission which was held in Delhi in October 1986. 
    
      <br>Other visits from this area included the high powered Kuwaiti  
   Investment delegation which visited India in October 1986 with a  
   view to search avenues for Kuwaiti investment in India. A  
   delegation from Bahrain visited India in November 1986 during the  
   India International Trade Fair. Similarly, a Trade delegation  
   from Oman visited India in November 1986 to discuss about trade  
   relations between the two countries. The Yemen Arab Republic  
   Communication Minister visited India in December 1986 to discuss  
   co-operation in the field of telecommunication between India and  
the YAR. 
<br> 
<br>   The continuing Iran-Iraq war and its adverse impact in terms  
   of human suffering continued to remain a matter of concern for  
   India has friendly and broad-based relations with both countries  
   which are also members of the Non-Aligned Movement and is  
   interested in a speedy end to this tragic war. Our efforts to  
   find ways and means to bring an end to this tragic war continued  
   during the year under review. 
<br> 
<br>   The Iraqi Permanent Under Secretary and the Foreign Minister  
   of Iran visited India before the Non-aligned Summit for bilateral  
   talks. 
<br> 
<br>   India has Joint Commissions with five Gulf countries, namely,  
   the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and the YAR. India also has  
   Joint Committees with Bahrain and Qatar. During the year under  
   review, the following meetings took place: 
<br> 
<br>(i)   The first meeting of the Indo-Bahrain Joint Committee in  
   March 1986. 
<br> 
<br>(ii)  The second Indo-Saudi Joint Commission meeting in April  
1986. 
<br> 
<br>(iii) The tenth session of the Indo-Iraq Joint Commission in  
October 1986. 
<br>-26&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   In these meetings agreements were reached for the  
   strengthening of bilateral relations and mutual co-operation in  
   various fields covering wide-ranging subjects. The fourth session  
   of the Indo-Iran Joint Commission is scheduled to meet in Delhi  
   in February 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   There are a large number of immigrant Indians working in the  
   Gulf. According to a conservative estimate they number over 7  
   lakhs. Owing to an economic recession in the Gulf countries, job  
   opportunities are fast dwindling. Any significant increase in the  
   number of our nationals working in the Gulf countries can be  
   ruled out. In fact there was apprehension that the number of  
   Indians working in the Gulf region would fall significantly as a  
   result of the recession in these countries. But this has not  
   taken place so far. Indian emigrants in the Gulf region are  
   prosperous and happy. However, considering their large numbers,  
   problems do arise from time to time. The Indian Missions  
   continued to provide the necessary consular help to the Indian  
   emigrants. 
<br> 
<br>   As a result of recession and falling oil prices, the income of  
   the Gulf countries has reduced and it is expected that these  
   countries will be looking towards other developing countries for  
   investment opportunities and economic co-operation for  
   development purposes. India, which has a key position as a  
   developing country, is likely to benefit from this.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>Relations between India and the countries in Africa South of  
   the Sahara continued to be cordial during the year under review.  
   Special efforts were made to intensify relations with Southern  
   African countries. The Prime Minister, accompanied by high- 
   powered delegations, paid visits to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and  
   Tanzania in May 1986 to highlight the value we attach to  
   bilateral relations with these countries as well as to underline  
   India's solidarity with them in regard to the liberation struggle  
   in South Africa and Namibia. India also entertained visits from  
   President Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress (ANC) and  
   from President Sam Nujoma of the South West Africa People's  
   Organisation (SWAPO) in May 1986. The South African question was  
   the subject of a Mini-Summit of seven Commonwealth Countries in  
   London in August 1986 in which our Prime Minister tried to bring  
   about unanimity of thinking in the matter of sanctions against  
   South Africa additional to the measures decided upon at the  
   Nassau Commonwealth Summit in 1985. 
<br> 
<br>   The Eighth Non-aligned Summit held in Harare (Zimbabwe) in  
   September 1986 expressed its grave concern on the deteriorating  
   situation in Southern Africa. It took note of the initiatives  
   taken by many countries and organisations to have the problem  
   resolved through negotiations. It regretted that instead of  
   heeding the call of the international community to eradicate  
   apartheid, the racist regime had stepped up its oppression and  
   the subjugation of the disenfranchised and dispossessed people of  
   South Africa through the imposition of a state of emergency and  
   other repressive measures. It reaffirmed that the imposition of  
   comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa in  
   accordance with Chapter 7 of the Charter of the United Nations  
   was the only peaceful option to compel the racist regime to  
   abandon apartheid. The Summit Meeting also 
<br>-28&gt; 
<br> 
<br>noted that the racist regime had intensified its campaign of  
   intimidation, blackmail, economic sanctions and naked acts of  
   aggression against the independent states in the region with a  
   view to weakening and subjugating them. It stressed the need for  
   concerted international action both short-term and long-term to  
   provide assistance to the Frontline States in the region to  
   enable them to withstand the effect of retaliatory sanctions by  
   the racist Pretoria region. 
<br> 
<br>   As a concrete measure it was resolved to establish the Action  
   for Resisting Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid Fund (AFRICA  
   Fund). The nine-Member Fund Committee consists of India  
   (Chairman), Zambia (Vice-Chairman), Algeria, Argentina, Congo,  
   Nigeria, Peru, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe. The objectives of the  
   Fund are to strengthen the economic and financial capability of  
   the Frontline States; to assist them enforce sanctions against  
   South Africa and to cope with retaliatory action by the racist  
   regime. The measures envisaged in the Resolution to achieve these  
   objectives include: the establishment of a strategic relief  
   reserve to relieve shortages of essential commodities; the  
   strengthening of the transport and communication system; the  
   ensuring of continued availability of oil and other energy  
   sources; the ensuring of safety of infrastructural installations  
   and net-works; the neutralising of the negative trade effects;  
   the development of trained manpower resources and the  
   mobilisation of international public opinion and financial  
   resources for fulfilling the objectives of the Fund. 
    
<br><br>   India, in the capacity of Chairman of the Fund, undertook  
extensive consultations with the Frontline States and liberation  
   movements to identify specific areas in which assistance is  
   urgently required. 
<br> 
<br>   The Summit Meeting of the Fund Committee Member-States was  
   held in New Delhi on 24 and 25 January 1987. It was preceded by  
   preparatory meetings of Senior Officials and Foreign Ministers.  
   The Summit adopted a Plan of Action and the Rules of procedure  
   for management and operation of the Fund. The Plan of Action sets  
   out specific projects and measures to be undertaken by the Fund  
   to achieve its objectives. It consists of 9 chapters including 7  
   areas of priority assistance to the Frontline States, support to  
   the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia and  
   mobilisation of public opinion and financial 
<br>-29&gt; 
<br> 
<br>resources. The Rules of Procedure provide for a sub-committee  
   under the Chairmanship of Zambia for screening and evaluation of  
   projects. It also provides for periodical reports on the funds  
   operations to be submitted by the Fund Committee to the  
   Ministerial and Summit Conferences of the Non-aligned Countries.  
   The Summit also issued an appeal calling upon all nations of the  
   world, international financial and other organisations, non- 
   governmental organisations and individuals to contribute  
   generously to the AFRICA Fund in demonstration of their  
   unflinching solidarity with the struggle against apartheid.  
   During the summit meeting, contributions amounting to US $ 70  
   million, which includes India's contribution of Rs. 50 crores  
   over a period of three years, were pledged to the Fund. 
<br> 
<br>   A resident Indian diplomatic Mission at Embassy level was  
   opened in Luanda, Angola, in September 1986. A Mission is also  
   expected to be opened in Gaborone, Botswana, in the very near  
   future. With the establishment of these Missions, India would  
   have resident diplomatic representation in all the Six Frontline  
   States of Southern Africa.

<tr><td>India's relations with the countries of Western Europe  
   continued to be cordial and friendly. On major questions, their  
   attitudes and views were usually modified not to clash too  
   vehemently with those of their close ally, the United States.  
   However, their belief in political and negotiated settlements for  
   resolving problems and reducing tensions, often runs parallel to  
   India's views, even if they do not coincide. There is not much  
   doubt that on larger questions of East-West or North-South  
   relations, Europeans do take a longer term perspective and arrive  
   at conclusions not dissimilar to those of India. 
<br> 
<br>   The internal political stability and credit-worthiness of  
   India have strengthened the belief among West European countries  
   of India as a nation of growing significance in Asia and the  
   world. These countries, in their search for new markets to  
   support their highly export dependent economies, have thus rated  
   India high on their list. The twelve members of the European  
   Community remain our major trading partners, and co-operation  
   with the Community is being actively pursued in the fields of  
   industrial co-operation, investment and co-operation in science  
   and technology. In addition the Scandinavian countries continued  
   to extend economic aid to India especially for projects in the  
   fields of social welfare, health and rural development. There is  
   considerable scope for India to co-operate with these countries  
   in high technology areas. 
<br> 
<br>   Indian exports to countries in Western Europe have registered  
   some increase but the range of products remained narrow and the  
   deficit in the balance of trade 
   <br>-33&gt; 
<br> 
<br>has increased. While this is of concern to India, it can be  
attributed to favourable investment climate, import of capital  
   goods and our requirement for import of new technology as also to  
   the protective policies of the Community. These aspects were  
   discussed in detail during the Indo-EEC Joint Commission Meeting  
   held in Brussels in January 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   The Joint Economic and Trade Committees between India and  
   Greece, Sweden, Spain and Austria held their meetings in 1986.  
   The main focus was on expansion of Indian exports, commodity and  
   quantum-wise. Particular attention was paid to establishing joint  
   collaboration with import of latest technology and buy back  
   arrangements. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review, there were several high-level  
visits. The President of India visited Greece when an extensive  
exchange of views took place on bilateral and international  
issues. The Vice President of India visited France to attend the  
closing ceremonies of the Festival of India. 
<br> 
<br>   The visits of Chancellor Kohl of the Federal Republic of  
Germany (FRG), of Prime Ministers Turgut Ozal of Turkey, of  
Benito Craxi of Italy and of Paul Schlueter of Denmark provided  
fresh impetus and added greater economic and commercial content  
in our bilateral relations with these respective countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Finland's President Mauno Koivisto paid a 4 day State visit to  
India in February 1987. The delegation included, among others,  
the Foreign Minister of Finland. During the visit, bilateral and  
international matters including disarmament and North-South  
dialogue were discussed between the leaders of the two countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Both the Dutch Prime Minister Mr. R. F. M. Lubbers and the  
Foreign Minister of France Mr. Jean Bernard Raimond paid official  
visits during March 1987. 
<br>-34&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The Minister for External Affairs, Shri N.D. Tiwari, visited  
Italy, Belgium, France, the FRG and the UK as part of an AFRICA  
Fund delegation. In addition, there were many visits at the  
Ministerial level in economic, industrial, commercial, cultural  
and educational fields apart from exchanges of parliamentary  
delegations, industrial and business groups, academicians,  
journalists, etc. 
<br> 
<br>   The governments in Western Europe have generally been  
responsive to our concern at the anti-India activities in their  
countries. We have been monitoring these activities and have been  
in constant touch with those governments. Negotiations have also  
commenced for concluding an Extradition Treaty with the FRG. 
<br> 
<br>   However, in the case of Britain, our concern has been  
expressed to the British authorities and every opportunity was  
utilised to suggest to the UK that such activities should be  
curbed with a strong hand. One of our suggestions for effectively  
curbing terrorist activities in the UK was for the two countries  
to enter into an Extradition Treaty. Two rounds of talks have  
already taken place and discussions are continuing. In the  
meanwhile, the British authorities have taken some action in  
convicting/bringing to trial some extremists/terrorists in the  
UK. 
<br> 
<br>THE USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE 
<br> 
<br>   The period under review saw continuation of development of  
mutually beneficial bilateral relations with the USSR and other  
socialist countries in Eastern Europe. 
<br> 
<br>   The General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mr. M.S.  
Gorbachev paid an official friendly visit to India in November  
1986. Mr. Gorbachev was accompanied by his wife and a high- 
powered delegation which consisted of, interalia, Foreign  
Minister E.A. Shevardnadze, CPSU CC Secretary A.F. Dobrynin, 
<br>-35&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Deputy Prime Minister V.M. Kamentsev, Chief of General Staff of  
the USSR Armed Forces Marshal S.F. Akhromeyev and First Deputy  
Foreign Minister Y.M. Vorontsov. The visit was a landmark in  
Indo-Soviet relations. It provided the occasion for the  
continuation of the dialogue begun between the two leaders during  
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to Moscow in May 1985. Prime  
Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Mr. M.S. Gorbachev held extensive and  
cordial discussions on important bilateral, regional and  
international issues. Mr. M.S. Gorbachev called on the President,  
Giani Zail Singh, and addressed Members of the Indian Parliament.  
The other members of the delegation held discussions with their  
Indian counterparts on various bilateral matters. The visit  
served to reaffirm the dynamic, resilient and stable character of  
Indo-Soviet relations and demonstrated once again the coincidence  
or similarity of views of the two countries on major  
international issues. In the course of the visit the two leaders  
signed the Delhi Declaration on Principles for a Nuclear Weapon  
Free and Non-violent World which embodies a comprehensive new  
framework for international relations based on freedom, equality,  
justice and non-violence. The other documents signed were an  
Agreement on Economic and Technical Co-operation, the largest to  
have been signed between the two countries so far, a Consular  
Convention, and a Protocol on conducting the Festival of India in  
the USSR and the Festival of the USSR in India. 
<br> 
<br>   The then Minister for External Affairs and Commerce, Shri P.  
Shiv Shanker, and subsequently the Minister for External Affairs,  
Shri N.D. Tiwari, visited the Soviet Union during 1986. During  
their visits the Ministers held talks with their Soviet  
counterpart, Mr. E.A. Shevardnadze, and called on General  
Secretary Gorbachev. 
<br> 
<br>   The Tenth meeting of the Indo-Soviet Joint Commission for  
Economic, Scientific and Technical Co-operation was held in New  
Delhi in April 1986. The two sides were led respectively by the  
then Minister for External Affairs, Shri B.R. Bhagat, and the  
then Soviet First Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. I.V. Arkhipov. The  
meeting reviewed ongoing bilateral co-operation in various  
projects and took stock of the progress made in implementation of  
the agreements signed during the Indian Prime Minister's visit in  
May 1985. The meeting also discussed new areas of co-operation  
between the two countries. The Trade Protocol for 1987 was signed  
in New Delhi in November 1986. The Protocol envisages an increase 
<br>-36&gt; 
<br> 
<br>in the quantum of already traded goods and the identification of  
fresh commodities for trade between the two countries. The  
Chairman of the USSR State Committee for Foreign Economic  
Relations, Mr. K.F. Katushev, and the Minister for Petroleum  
Industry, Mr. V.A. Dinkov, visited India in connection with the  
economic agreements signed during General Secretary Gorbachev's  
visit. The Soviet Ministers for Aviation Industry, Mr. A.S.  
Systsov, and for Health, Mr. S.P. Burenkov, also visited India. 
<br> 
<br>   Exchanges in culture, arts, education, sports, mass-media and  
other fields developed well. Preparations for conducting the  
Festival of India in the USSR and the Festival of the USSR in  
India reached an important stage with the signing of a Protocol  
during General Secretary Gorbachev's visit. A Parliamentary  
delegation led by the Soviet First Vice President, Mr. V.V.  
Kuznetsov, visited India in January 1986. 
 
<br><br>The 15th anniversary of the Indo-Soviet Treaty on Peace,  
Friendship and Co-operation was marked by both countries. On this  
occasion and on the occasion of Independence Day, India played

   narrow differences between India and the USA in perception and in  
   the approach to various regional and international issues through  
   an exchange of official visits and the intensification of people-

<br>   Economic contacts between India and the USA were given an  
   impetus through trade and collaboration in the field of  
   technology transfer. The new procedures under the Indo-US  
   Memorandum of Understanding on Technology Transfer resulted in  
   the clearance of many computer systems for governmental and non- 
   governmental organisations in India. Several official level  
   contacts 
<br>-42&gt; 
<br> 
<br>were held to streamline the procedures. In 1986, India continued  
   to maintain a positive balance of trade with the USA with exports  
   to that country amounting to $ 2478.3 million and imports of the  
   order of $ 1641.9 million. Contacts between the business  
   communities of both countries were intensified in tune with the  
   growing optimism of better commercial prospects and industrial  
   collaboration. 
<br> 
<br>   The Indian Naval Frigate INS Godavari participated in the  
   Centenary Celebration of the Statue of Liberty in June-July 1986.  
   It was the first-ever goodwill visit by an Indian naval ship to  
   the USA. The year long Festival of India was formally concluded  
   in November 1986 having provided a unique window to India for the  
   Americans. 
<br> 
<br>   India and Canada continued to maintain a close dialogue on  
   bilateral and international issues. The Prime Ministers of India  
   and Canada met in London in August 1986 where they were attending  
   the Commonwealth Mini-Summit on the question of sanctions against  
   South Africa. The then Minister for External Affairs Shri B.R.  
   Bhagat, and the Canadian Secretary oj State for External Affairs,  
   Mr. Joe Clark, met on 20 June, in Cork, Ireland, where they were  
   taking part in the commemoration of the first anniversary of the  
   tragic crash of an Air-India Boeing 747. The Speaker of the Lok  
   Sabha, Dr. Balram Jakhar, also visited Canada from 27 May to 7  
   June 1986 to attend the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association  
   Executive Committee Meeting. 
<br> 
<br>   Canadian Law enforcement agencies took vigorous steps to meet  
   the threat of terrorism posed by extremist elements based in  
   Canada. Their effective action resulted in the aversion of  
   senseless tragedies and loss of innocent lives. The Canadian  
   authorities initiated a number of legal actions against  
   extremists and terrorists conspiring to commit violence against  
   India. An Extradition Treaty was signed during the visit of  
   Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Mr. Joe Clark in  
   February 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   Indo-Canadian economic ties are expected to receive an impetus  
   on account of the determination of both countries to expand and  
   diversify them. A Memorandum of Understanding on Industrial and  
   Technological Co-operation 
<br>-43&gt; 
<br> 
<br>was signed in February. Contacts between the business communities  
   of the two countries increased including a meeting of the India- 
   Canada Business Council in Toronto. Several economic delegations  
   were exchanged and Canada participated as a partner country with  
   fifty leading Canadian firms in the Trade Fair organised by the  
   Confederation of Engineering Industries in New Delhi in February  
   1987. 
<br> 
<br>CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN 
<br> 
      India's relations with the countries of Latin America and the  
   Caribbean continued to grow during the period under review.  
   Exchanges of high-level visits, signing of bilateral agreements  
   and active co-operation with the countries of the region  
   strengthened India's relations with these countries and laid the  
   basis for further development of ties. 
<br> 
<br>   The major events were the visits of the Presidents of  
   Nicaragua and Peru to India and the visit of the Indian Prime  
   Minister to Mexico. Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega paid a  
   State visit to India from 8 to 11 September 1986 during which  
   three bilateral agreements-a Cultural Agreement, a Memorandum of  
   Understanding and a Credit Agreement-were signed. The Memorandum  
   of Understanding provides for the gifts of wheat and raw jute by  
   India to Nicaragua and India's co-operation in the setting-up of  
   industrial projects in Nicaragua; under the Credit Agreement, a  
   credit of Rs. 12.5 crores will be made available to Nicaragua. 
    
<br><br>Peruvian President Dr. Alan Garcia Perez paid a State visit  
from 23 to 29 January 1987 during which he took part in the  
   'AFRICA Fund' Summit on 24-25 January in New Delhi. He was also  
   the Chief Guest for the 1987 Republic Day celebrations. During  
   the visit, bilateral discussions were held and a cultural  
   agreement envisaging co-operation between India and Peru in  
   various fields was signed. The Peruvian President was conferred  
   an honorary degree of Dactor of Laws by Delhi University at a  
   colourful function at Vigyan Bhavan. 
<br>-44&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   An Indian techno-economic team visited Nicaragua in April to  
   assess the Possibilities of bilateral economic and technical co- 
   operation. As a result of discussions with the Nicaraguan  
   authorities, areas of co-operation in industry, infrastructure  
   and increased trade were identified. 
<br> 
<br>   A delegation of Members of Parliament led by Shri R. L.  
   Bhatia, MP and General Secretary AICC(I), visited Nicaragua for  
   the 25th Anniversary Celebrations of the Sandinist National  
   Liberation Front (FSLN) in November 1986. The delegation included  
   Shri Anand Sharma, MP and President of IYC(I), Shri Mukul Wasnik,  
   MP (Congress I), Shri E.M.S. Namboodiripad, MP and Secretary  
   General CPI(M), Shri N.E. Balaram, MP and Secretary, National  
   Council of CPI, and Shri Chitta Basu, MP and Secretary General,  
   Forward Block of India. 
<br> 
<br>   The situation in Central America continued to be tense and  
   volatile. On various occasions in the UN and the Non-Aligned  
   Movement (NAM) for a India reiterated support for the Contadora  
   effort and its position that the Central American issues should  
   be resolved peacefully through dialogue among the countries of  
   the region without outside interference or introduction of big- 
   power rivalries. 
<br> 
<br>   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi paid a visit to Mexico from 7 to 9  
   August 1986 after the Six-Nation Ixtapa Summit on Peace and  
   Disarmament. The Prime Minister's discussions with President  
   Miguel de la Madrid reflected shared perceptions on major  
   international issues and a common concern for Peace, Disarmament  
   and Development. The two leaders agreed to give greater content  
   to bilateral economic co-operation. 
<br> 
<br>   At the invitation of the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies  
   of Venezuela a seven-member Parliamentary delegation, led by the  
   Speaker, Dr. Balram Jakhar, visited Venezuela from 30 June to 6  
   July 1986. During the visit, the Speaker unveiled a bust of  
   Mahatma Gandhi presented by India. 
<br>-45&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   India was again among the co-sponsors of a UN General Assembly  
   (UNGA) Resolution on the Falklands/Malvinas calling upon  
   Argentina and the UK to hold negotiations with a view to  
   resolving their dispute which was adopted by an overwhelming  
   majority (116 for, 4 against, 34 abstentions). 
<br> 
<br>   The Finance Minister Shri V. P. Singh visited Brasilia and  
   held bilateral discussions with Brazilian leaders after leading  
   India's delegation to the Ministerial Meeting of the Negotiating  
   Committee for the GSTP from 19 to 23 May 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   A delegation led by Minister of State for Science and  
   Technology, Shri Shivraj Patil, visited Havana from 29 June to 2  
   July 1986 to attend the inauguration of a Cuban Bio-Technology  
   Centre. 
<br> 
<br>   An Indian delegation led by Smt. Sushila Rohatgi, the then

   Mr. Errol Barrow, Leader of the Democratic Labour Party of  
   Barbados, who was appointed Prime Minister following a landslide  
   victory in the country's general elections held in May 1986 and  
   to Mr. A.N.R. Robinson on his assuming the Prime Ministership of  
   Trinidad &amp; Tobago following the sweeping victory (33 seats out of  
   36) of the National Alliance for Reconstruction in Trinidad &amp;  
   Tobago in December 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   India donated medical supplies worth Rs. 50,000 to Jamaica for

<tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>As in previous years, India played an active and constructive  
   role in various international conferences and sessions of the UN  
   General Assembly and Security Council held during 1986. The major  
   international conferences held under the UN auspices included the  
   World Conference on Sanctions against South Africa in Paris in  
   June 1986, the International Conference for the Immediate  
   Independence of Namibia in July 1986 and the Special Session of  
   the UN General Assembly on Namibia in September 1986. The UN  
   General Assembly also held a special session on Africa in May  
   1986. The Eighth Summit Conference of Non-aligned Countries was  
   also held in Harare in September 1986 when India handed over the  
   Chairmanship of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) to Zimbabwe. 
<br> 
<br>   The 41st session of the UN General Assembly, held during  
   September-December 1986, remained primarily pre-occupied with one  
   overriding issue-the most serious financial crisis in the history  
   of the United Nations in addition to wide ranging deliberations  
   on various political, economic, social, cultural and legal  
   questions. 
<br> 
<br>Political Issues at the United Nations 
<br> 
<br>   A whole range of disarmament issues, the situation in Southern  
   Africa, West Asia, Central America and decolonisation questions  
   dominated the political agenda of the United Nations during the  
   year under review. Among the new items of the agenda of the 41st  
   session of the UN General Assembly were the US aggression against  
   Libya and the re-inscription of New Caledonia in the UN's list of  
   non-self-governing territories. 
<br>-48&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The three major and inter-related aspects of the South African  
   situation, namely, South Africa's policy of apartheid, its  
   illegal occupation of Namibia and its repeated acts of aggression  
   and subversion against neighbouring African countries, received  
   constant attention at the United Nations, including in the  
   Security Council. 
<br> 
<br>   The continuing crisis in South Africa and the intensification  
   of repression of the black majority by the racist regime evoked  
   serious concern at the United Nations throughout the year under  
   review in the Security Council, the General Assembly and the  
   Special Committee against Apartheid. A major international  
   initiative to combat apartheid was the World Conference on  
   Sanctions against Racist South Africa held in Paris in June 1986.  
   India as Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, along with the  
   Organisation of African Unity (OAU), was one of the co-sponsors  
   of this Conference. The Indian delegation played a major role in  
   harmonising positions and ensuring full reaffirmation of the  
   urgent necessity for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions  
   against South Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   As Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement, India was also  
   specially invited to a seminar on Arms Embargo against South  
   Africa held in London in May 1986. The London seminar led to the  
   adoption, by consensus, of Resolution 591 of the Security Council  
   later in the year, which aims at addressing the problem of  
   circumvention of loopholes in the international Arms Embargo  
   against South Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   India maintained an active role in the UN Special Committee  
   against Apartheid, the principal UN organ to keep South Africa's  
   policy of apartheid under constant review. India was closely  
   involved with the preparation of six draft resolutions in the  
   Special Committee on Situation in South Africa and Assistance to  
   Liberation Movements, Comprehensive and Mandatory Sanctions  
   against the Racist Regime of South Africa, Status of the  
   International Convention against Apartheid in Sports, Programme  
   of Work of the Special Committee against Apartheid, Concerted  
   International Action for the Elimination of Apartheid and  
   Relations between Israel and South Africa. In addition to these,  
   two resolutions on Oil Embargo against South Afrca and the United  
   Nations 
<br>-49&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Trust Fund for South Africa were drafted by Norway and Sweden  
   respectively, The resolutions were adopted by the General  
   Assembly by large majorities. India co-sponsored all resolutions  
   except two and voted in favour of all of them. 
<br> 
<br>   The continued illegal and colonial occupation of Namibia by  
   South Africa remained a major concern of the United Nations. An  
   International Conference for the Immediate Independence of  
   Namibia at Ministerial level was convened in Namibia in July 1986  
   where India represented the Non-aligned Movement. The Vienna  
   Conference reaffirmed the resolve of the International community  
   to assure freedom, human dignity and their rightful place in the  
   international community for the people of Namibia. A highlight of  
   the Conference was an eloquent and moving appeal addressed by a  
   Group of Eminent Persons specially invited to Vienna which  
   included Sardar Swaran Singh from India. 
<br> 
<br>   The UN General Assembly also held a Special Session on Namibia  
   in September 1986. India was one of the countries mandated by the  
   Harare Summit of Non-aligned Countries to participate in the  
   Special Session at Ministerial level and the External Affairs  
   Minister led the Indian delegation. The Special Session  
   reaffirmed the direct responsibility of the United Nations for  
   Namibia until independence. It reiterated that comprehensive  
   mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter were the  
   most effective means to ensure the compliance of South Africa  
   with the decisions of the United Nations on Namibia. It also  
   urged those States which have not yet done so to immediately  
   cease, individually and collectively, all dealings with South  
   Africa in order to ensure its total isolation. 
<br> 
<br>   India maintained its active participation in the UN Council  
   for Namibia and was re-elected as a Vice President of the Council  
   upon the assumption of office by her new Permanent Representative  
   to the United Nations. 
<br> 
<br>   The Security Council held meetings on several occasions during  
   the year under review in the wake of South African acts of  
   aggression and destabilisation  
<br>-50&gt; 
<br> 
<br>against neighbouring African States. Following South African  
   raids in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe in May 1986, the non- 
   aligned caucus in the Security Council pressed for imposition of  
   mandatory sanctions against South Africa. A similar effort was  
   made during the Council session in June 1986 in the wake of a  
   South African raid on the Angolan Port of Namib. While the vetoes  
   of certain permanent members of the Security Council prevented  
   the adoption of mandatory sanctions, the Security Council  
   meetings effectively mirrored the sense of international outrage  
   and anguish at Pretoria's policy of aggression and  
   destabilisation. 
<br> </td></tr>
<tr><td>The continuing conflict in the Central American region was the  
   subject of discussion on several occasions during the year under  
   review. The Security Council convened on two occasions in July  
   1986 at the request of Nicaragua following approval of funds for  
   the Contra rebels by the US Congress and the judgement of the  
   International Court of Justice (27 June 1986) declaring US  
   actions against Nicaragua to be in violation of international  
   law. A further Meeting of the Security Council was held in  
   October 1986 at the request of Nicaragua to seek US compliance  
   with the judgement of the International Court of Justice.  
   Participating in the debate, India's Permanent Representative  
   called for greater efforts to bring the Contadora peace process  
   to fruition and underlined the need for full co-operation of the  
   international community. He also urged member-States to be fully  
   responsive to their obligations under the UN Charter. The  
   incidents on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border in 1986 were also  
   considered by the Security Council at the request of Nicaragua in  
   December 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The situation in Central America was also addressed by the UN  
   General Assembly during its 41st session which adopted a  
   consensus resolution sponsored by the Contadora and the Lima  
   Support Group. The resolution essentially endorsed the Contadora  
   peace process and affirmed the need for its acceleration. In his  
   intervention during the debate, India's Permanent Representative  
   stressed the need for resolution of the problems in the region in  
   a regional perspective through dialogue and negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>   The General Assembly also adopted a separate resolution,  
   sponsored by Nicaragua, affirming the need for compliance with  
   the judgement of the 
   <br>-51&gt; 
<br> 
<br>International Court of Justice by 94 votes against 3 with 47  
abstentions. India voted in favour. 
<br> 
<br>   The Security Council met in February 1986 to consider the  
   situation between Iran and Iraq and, after prolonged  
   consultations, unanimously adopted Resolution 582 on the basis of  
   a working paper prepared by the ten non-permanent members of the  
   Council. The resolution deplored the initial acts which gave rise  
   to the conflict as well as its continuation and escalation and  
   called for an immediate ceasefire. The Security Council convened  
   again in October 1986 to discuss this question. In a statement,  
   the Secretary General of the United Nations reiterated the  
   necessity for the Security Council to establish a basis upon  
   which both sides would find it possible to co-operate with the  
   United Nations in its efforts to promote a settlement. The  
   Security Council adopted a resolution calling upon Iran and Iraq  
   to implement Council Resolution 582 and requested the Secretary  
   General to intensify his efforts with the two nations to give  
   effect to the Resolution. 
<br> 
<br>   The General Assembly debated the question of Afghanistan at  
   its 41st session. It adopted a resolution by 122 votes to 20 with  
   11 abstentions. India abstained. In his speech, India's delegate  
   Shri Vayalar Ravi explained that the resolution was less than  
   fully constructive and supportive of the efforts being made by  
   the Secretary General and his Special Representative. India is of  
   the view that the situation there can be resolved only through an  
   overall political settlement based on the principles set out at  
   the conference of Foreign Ministers of the Non-aligned Countries  
   held in New Delhi in February 1981 and reiterated at the Seventh  
   and Eigth Summit of the Non-aligned Movement. 
<br> 
<br>   The situation in Kampuchea was debated in the General Assembly  
   on 20-21 October 1986. A number of delegations expressed  
   reservations on the credentials of "Democratic Kampuchea".  
   However, there was no formal move to challenge its credentials.  
   The substantive resolution on Kampuchea was adopted by 115 votes  
   to 21 with 13 abstentions. As in the past, India abstained on the  
   resolution and pointed out that the adoption of one-sided  
   resolutions, the recourse to inflexible positions and attempts  
   for the restoration of the status quo ante would not create the  
   conditions in which a peaceful and lasting solution could be  
   found. 
<br>-52&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The ad hoc committee on the Indian Ocean meeting in July 1986  
   adopted a consensus report and draft resolution for adoption by  
   the General Assembly. This resolution was adopted at the 41st  
   session without vote. The resolution called on the ad hoc  
   committee to complete preparatory work relating to the Conference  
   on the Indian Ocean by 1987 in order to enable the convening of  
   the Colombo Conference on the Indian Ocean at an early date  
   thereafter but not later than 1988. The resolution reiterated  
   that the Conference and the establishment and maintenance of the  
   Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace required the full and active  
   participation and co-operation of all the permanent members of  
   the Security Council, the major maritime users and the littoral  
   and hinterland States. 
<br> 
<br>   The question of Antarctica was considered in the First  
   Committee of the UN General Assembly where the debate reflected  
   differing points of view. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative  
   Parties (ATCPs) maintained that the Antarctic Treaty regime had  
   preserved international peace and security in the Antarctic,  
   promoted peaceful co-operation and scientific research in the  
   area, ensured environmental protection, reconciled conflicting  
   territorial claims and maintained the Antarctic as a nuclear free  
   zone. Many non-ATCP countries called for a more universal regime  
   for the Antarctic, some seeking to declare the Antarctic as a  
   "common heritage of mankind". As at the 40th session, three  
   separate resolutions were tabled during the year under review.  
   One requested the Treaty Parties to keep the Secretary General  
   fully informed on all aspects of the question of Antarctica so  
   that the United Nations could "function as the central  
   repository" of all such information, and, requested the Secretary  
   General to continue to follow all aspects of the question of  
   Antarctica to provide an updated report to the General Assembly  
   at its 42nd session. The second resolution called upon the  
   Antarctic Treaty Parties to impose a "moratorium" on the  
   negotiations to establish a minerals regime until such time "as  
   all members of the international community can participate fully  
   in such negotiations". The third resolution called for the  
   exclusion of South Africa from all meetings of the consultative  
   parties. India voted in favour of the third resolution. 
<br> 
<br>   The XIII Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties  
   took place in Brussels in October 1986 where China and Uruguay  
   were admitted as ATCPs. Meetings on the ongoing negotiations for  
   the establishment of an Antarctic minerals regime were held in  
   Hobart in April 1986 and at Tokyo in October-November 1986.

<tr class="evenRow"><td> The situation in West Asia engaged the attention of the UN  
Security Council on several occasions during 1986. In January,  
   the Council considered Lebanon's complaint against Israeli  
   measures and practices against the civilian population in  
   Southern Lebanon. In the same month, the Council convened to  
   consider the situation in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories  
   following allegations of Israeli violation of the Haram Al Sharif  
   shrine in Jerusalem. However, owing to the veto of a Permanent  
   Member of the Security Council, no resolutions could be adopted  
   on these occasions. In December 1986, the Council met on the  
   complaint of the PLO following the killing by Israeli security  
   forces of some students in the Bir Zeit University in the  
   occupied territories. The Council adopted Resolution 592 C  
   reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention relating  
   to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War to the  
   Palestine and other territories occupied by Israel and called  
   upon Israel to abide by it. Earlier, the President of the  
   Security Council issued a statement on behalf of the Members of  
   the Council on 2 December 1986, expressing concern at the  
   escalation of violence around the Palestinian refugee camps in  
   Lebanon. 
<br> 
<br>   The 41st session of the UN General Assembly adopted altogether  
   seven resolutions relating to the situation in West Asia-four  
   resolutions on the question of Palestine and three on the  
   situation in the Middle East. India reiterated its support to the  
   right of self-determination of the Palestinian people including  
   its right to an independent homeland. We also supported the  
   holding of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  
   under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation  
   of all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict including the PLO as  
   well as the USA, the USSR and other concerned States on an equal  
   footing. In this context, we also supported the proposal for the  
   establishment of a Preparatory Committee within the framework of  
   the Security Council with the participation of its Permanent  
   Members to take necessary action to convene the Conference. 
<br> 
<br>   During the 41st session of the General Assembly, India  
   maintained its traditional position on issues of decolonisation,  
   stressing particularly the responsibility of the United Nations  
   and of negotiation in this regard. India co-sponsored the two  
   main resolutions on the Implementation of the Declaration on the  
   Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and on  
   the Dissemination of Information on Decolonisation, both of which  
   were 
<br>-54&gt; 
<br> 
<br>adopted by the General Assembly. India also supported the  
   resolution sponsored by the South Pacific Forum calling for the  
   re-inscription of New Caledonia on the list of non-self-governing  
   territories of the United Nations. India co-sponsored the  
   resolution in the General Assembly urging an immediate ceasefire  
   in the Western Sahara region to prepare for a referendum to be  
   conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and the OAU.  
   It also co-sponsored a resolution urging the Governments of  
   Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations to  
   discuss all aspects of the problem of the Falkland Islands  
   (Malvinas).

<br>   The resolutions on decolonisation in the General Assembly also  
<br>condemned the continued illegal occupation of Namibia by South  
   Africa and urged the stopping of foreign economic and military  
   activities that are detrimental to the decolonisation process.  
   The General Assembly also devoted time to a separate discussion  
   on the question of Namibia. Coming as it did less than two months  
   after the Special Session on Namibia, the discussions in the  
   General Assembly reflected the continued and indeed growing  
   concern and resolve of the world community on this issue. 
<br> 
<br>Disarmament Issues 
<br> 
<br>   During 1986 India was active in all multilateral disarmament  
   fora, namely, the Conference on Disarmament, the UN Disarmament  
   Commission, and the First Committee of the UN General Assembly.  
   This is in keeping with the Indian view that in this nuclear age,  
   disarmament is indispensable not only for world peace but for the  
   very survival of mankind. 
<br> 
<br>   India took several initiatives in the UN General Assembly to  
   promote nuclear disarmament. India's two resolutions calling for  
   a freeze on nuclear weapons and a convention on the prohibition  
   of use of nuclear weapons respectively were adopted with  
   overwhelming majorities. Of the 65 other resolutions on  
   disarmament adopted by the UN General Assembly, India supported  
   the vast majority and abstained on only a few. The International  
   Conference on Disarmament and Development, which could not be  
   held in 1986, is now to be held in New York from 24 August to 11  
   September 1987. India, as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee,  
   has worked actively for the 
<br>-55&gt; 
<br> 
<br>convening of this Conference. It is a matter of regret that the  
   USA has announced its decision not to participate in the  
   Conference. 
<br> 
<br>   Certain proposals sought to divert attention from the highest  
   priority issues of nuclear disarmament and prevention of nuclear  
   war. On all these, India took a forthright stand and, in a number  
   of cases, abstained from voting or voted against these  
   resolutions. As in the past, India voted against the Pakistani  
   resolution on a nuclear weapon free zone in South Asia, and  
   expressed grave concern at the discordant note that its annual  
   proposal introduced into the process of regional co-operation  
   which the countries of South Asia are seeking to promote. 
<br> 
<br>   India also continued her disarmament efforts through the Six- 
   Nation Initiative. After the Delhi Declaration, the Six  
   concentrated their efforts on securing a moratorium on all  
   nuclear testing by the US and the USSR, as a first step towards a  
   Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In February 1986, the Six Nations  
   sent a message to the US and the USSR emphasizing the importance  
   of their reaching agreement on concrete steps to halt the nuclear  
   arms race at their next Summit meeting and suggesting a  
   suspension of all nuclear testing until then as a confidence  
   building measure. They also reiterated their offer, made in  
   October 1985, to verify suspension of nuclear testing. 
<br> 
<br>   The leaders of the Six Nations met again on 6 August 1986 in  
   Ixtapa, Mexico. Emphasizing the importance of ending all nuclear  
   testing, they urged the two major nuclear weapon States to agree  
   on a moratorium on nuclear testing and put forward a concrete  
   proposal to assist in achieving adequate verification  
   arrangements for the same. 
<br> 
<br>   In response to the Ixtapa Declaration, both General Secretary  
   Gorbachev and President Reagan sent replies to the leaders of the  
   Six-Nation Initiative. The Soviet leader extended his full  
   support to the convictions expressed in the Declaration. He  
   supported the call for a moratorium on nuclear testing and  
   expressed his Government's willingness to enter into discussions  
   with experts from the Six nations on verification arrangements.  
   The US President, on the other hand, said that while a  
   Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty remained a 
<br>-56&gt; 
<br> 
<br>long term objective, for the time being the US found it necessary  
   to continue nuclear testing. He also rejected the verification  
   offer made by the Six-Nation Initiative. In a joint press release  
   on 3 October 1986, the leaders of the Six nations reiterated  
   their hope that the two major nuclear weapon States would agree  
   on a mutual suspension of testing and saw the next US-Soviet  
   Summit as presenting an excellent opportunity to reach an  
   agreement. 
<br> 
<br>   In a New Year Eve statement (30 December 1986), the Six again  
   urged the leaders of the Soviet Union and the USA to recommence  
   comprehensive talks to prevent an arms race in space and  
   terminate it on earth and ultimately to eliminate nuclear arms  
   everywhere. The Six felt that 1987 "provided an opportunity for  
   the Soviet Union and the United States to agree on a number of  
   disarmament measures, including deep cuts in nuclear arsenals". 
    
<br><br>The Six urged in particular the US to reconsider its decision  
to exceed the SALT II ceiling. They said they had also noted the  
   decision of the USSR to terminate its unilateral moratorium and  
   to resume nuclear testing following the first US test in 1987 and  
   hoped that this decision was not irreversible. At the same time,  
   the Six noted that there was still room for a bilateral  
   moratorium and reiterated their offer of ensuring adequate  
   verification of such a moratorium. 
<br> 
<br>   The Eigth Conference of Heads of State of Non-aligned  
   Countries met in Harare in September 1986 and issued the Harare  
   Appeal on Disarmament to the USA and the USSR. The Appeal  
   reiterated the commitment of the NAM to nuclear disarmament and  
   urged the super powers to take immediate steps to prevent the  
   outbreak of a nuclear war. The Appeal emphasized the need to  
   reach an accord for a permanent moratorium on nuclear tests. 
<br> 
<br>Economic Issues 
<br> 
<br>   During 1986 the overall climate for multilateral economic  
   negotiations remained unhelpful. 
   <br>-57&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The problems of developing countries particularly the heavily  
indebted countries and countries of sub-Saharan Africa received a  
   little more understanding and consideration. Discussions during  
   the year under review were, however, largely focussed on issues  
   concerning the major industrialised countries themselves.  
   Problems of developing countries have been treated more or less  
   as side issues. There is an increasing tendency among major  
   industrialised countries to reach agreements and arrangements on  
   matters of global interest among themselves. Even in the  
   traditional development fora the developed countries are more  
   actively pursuing issues of interest to them. 
<br> 
<br>   An important event in May 1986 was the holding of the Special  
   Session of the General Assembly on the critical economic  
   situation in Africa. This was the first time that a special  
   session was devoted to the problems of one region. The Assembly  
   adopted an agreed Plan of Action. Although the Plan of Action is  
   less specific than may have been hoped, it reflects the general  
   commitment of the international community to help the African  
   countries overcome the grave situation facing their economies.  
   The Indian delegation participated actively in the negotiations  
   both with the African countries as well as the donor community  
   which led to the final declaration. Although the adoption of the  
   Plan of Action was an important achievement, much will depend on  
   how effectively the general commitment towards Africa is  
   translated into effective assistance. 
<br> 
<br>   At the General Assembly session, another important achievement  
   was a consensus resolution on External Debt. This was an  
   important agreement for the United Nations as the developed  
   countries had so far shown little willingness to seriously  
   discuss issues relating to Money and Finance at the General  
   Assembly. In the past, they had taken the position that these  
   questions should be discussed only in the IMF and the World Bank.  
   There were also intensive discussions on the issue of  
   agricultural trade. In the area of trade, generally it is hoped  
   that the agreements reached at Punta del Este will check the  
   slide towards increasing protectionism. The forthcoming UNCTAD- 
   VII Conference in 1987 will provide an important opportunity to  
   discuss issues related to trade commodities, financial flows and  
   development. 
<br> 
<br>   The Pledging Conference for UN's Operational Activities for  
   Development showed an increase in nominal term in the pledges for  
   the major funds and 
<br>-58&gt; 
<br> 
<br>programmes of the United Nations. The financial situation of many  
   of these important programmes has stabilized though there is no  
   real increase in resources and in some cases there have been some  
   decline. Some institutions which have performed useful work such  
   as UNITAR are facing an acute financial crisis. It was with great  
   difficulty that agreement was possible on the restructuring and  
   continuation of UNITAR. The Indian delegation took very active  
   part in these negotiations to enable UNITAR to continue. UNFPA,  
   which is suffering from withholding of contribution by the United  
   States, has been able to secure additional commitments from other  
   donors. 
<br> 
<br>   In all fora, particularly at the meetings of the Non-aligned  
   Countries as well as the inter-governmental follow-up co- 
   ordination committee in Cairo, India continued to stress the  
   importance of increased South-South Co-operation. The major  
   development in this area following the Ministerial Meeting hosted  
   in Delhi was the holding of a Ministerial Meeting in Brasilia  
   which agreed to a negotiating framework for the Global System of  
   Trade Preferences. It is expected to stimulate trade among  
   developing countries. Another positive development was that  
   guidelines were agreed upon for identification, and for  
   formulation of specific ECDC projects from a special fund  
   designated as the Perez Guerero Fund for Economic and Technical  
   Co-operation among developing countries. The Fund will provide  
   valuable seed money for feasibility studies and formulation of  
   projects which can then be taken up by interested developing  
   countries on a self-financing and self-sustaining basis. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of the  
   Non-aligned Countries in April 1986 in New Delhi agreed in  
   principle for the setting-up of a Standing Ministerial Committee  
   for economic co-operation. A decision in this regard was  
   subsequently adopted at the Eighth Non-aligned Summit Conference  
   at Harare. The Standing Ministerial Committee will review and  
   harmonize policies and programmes of the non-aligned and other  
   developing countries to promote international economic co- 
   operation in response to the changing world economic situation,  
   especially in regard to the crucial issues of money, finance,  
   debt, trade and development. 
<br> 
<br>   India played a leading role in the General Assembly Session of  
   the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) held in  
   Montreal from 23 September 
<br>-59&gt; 
<br> 
<br>to 10 October 1986. The leader of the Indian delegation was  
   unanimously elected as the President of the Assembly. In the  
   opening statement at the Assembly, India, inter alia, expressed  
   deep anguish at the gruesome massacre of innocent people at the  
   Karachi airport. It expressed the hope that the incident will be  
   thoroughly investigated and appropriate stern action will be  
   taken against those found responsible for having caused such  
   excessive casualties in this unfortunate incident. 
<br> 
<br>Administrative and Budgetary Matters 
<br> 
<br>   During 1986, the UN faced the worst financial crisis in its  
   41-year history. This crisis was precipitated by the application  
   of the US legislation popularly known as the Kassebaum Amendment  
   which called for a 20% reduction in the contribution to the  
   United Nations till "meaningful reforms in the budgetary  
   procedure to the UN were introduced" which would allow major  
   contributors to play a greater role than hitherto in determining  
   not only the size of the budget but also the programmes it  
   contained. Additional reductions also resulted from the  
   application of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction  
   amendment to the US budget. These reductions were of crucial  
   significance as the US pays 25% of the UN budget and is its  
   largest contributor. 
<br> 
<br>   In April-May 1986, the 40th General Assembly was reconvened to  
   consider the current financial crisis. The Assembly approved  
   measures which included deferment of construction of conference  
   facilities, postponement of certain programmes and activities,  
   reduction in the frequency and duration of a number of meetings,  
   a freeze on recruitment and curtailment of the publications  
   programme. The Secretary General also urged early payment of  
   arrears and appealed for voluntary contributions. The application  
   of these economy measures have resulted in a saving of $ 67  
   million. As payment of arrears and voluntary contributions, an  
   additional $ 35 million was received. Nevertheless, in terms of  
   available cash balances, the UN continued to face severe  
   constraints during the year under review. 
<br> 
<br>   The 41st General Assembly agreed with the Secretary General's  
   proposal to continue these economy measures in 1987. It is  
   expected that the resultant savings would be of a higher order as  
   they would be applied throughout the calendar year. 
<br>-60&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The Group of High-Level Inter-governmental Experts to Review  
   the Efficiency and Administrative Functioning of the United  
   Nations, of which India was a member and where it performed a  
   significant role, recommended ways and means of streamlining and  
   increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the UN  
   Secretariat, the inter-governmental structure and the related  
   conference and meeting schedules. The Group also recommended  
   measures for improvement of co-ordination and priority setting  
   between activities and programmes. Of particular significance  
   were the recommendations which called for a 15% reduction in the  
   number of staff and a 25% reduction in the number of top echelon  
   posts and review of inter-governmental and Secretariat  
   structures. 
<br> 
<br>   The Group agreed that it was necessary for substantial  
   improvements to be made in the planning and budget process to  
   facilitate the attainment of broad agreement among member-States  
   on the level and content of the budget as failure to do so could  
   lead to a continuation of the current financial crisis. However,  
   no agreement was reached in the Group on the manner in which the  
   improvements were to be made. Thus the attention of the 41st  
   General Assembly, in its consideration of the Report of the  
   Group, focussed on the programme and budget process. Our approach  
   to the Report of the Group was that the measures to improve the  
   long-term efficiency and cost effectiveness of the UN should be  
   fully supported while at the same time it was necessary to ensure  
   that the UN continues to function on the basis of democratic  
   principles. India played an important and constructive role in  
   the negotiations at all levels and in shaping the UN General  
   Assembly resolution on the Report of the Group. We played a  
   particularly significant role in the negotiating and the drafting  
   of the section of the resolution relating to the planning and  
   budget process by which it has been agreed that in the budget  
   process consensus should be the desired objective towards which  
   all endeavours should be made. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Social and Humanitarian Issues 
<br> 
<br>   India has traditionally taken a keen interest in social and  
   humanitarian issues, both in the United Nations General Assembly,  
   the UN Commission for Human Rights and other related UN bodies.  
   This flows out of the commitment and principles on human rights  
   and social justice which are an essential part of our  
   Constitutional and Legislative provisions and also a very  
   important component 
<br>-61&gt; 
<br> 
<br>of social and political life in the country. On all issues of  
   importance to the developing and Non-aligned Countries India  
   helped in co-ordinating positions, first as Chairman of the Non- 
   aligned Movement and subsequently in close co-operation with  
   Zimbabwe, the current Chairman of the Non-aligned Movement. India  
   continued, as in previous years, to be closely involved with the  
   drafting of conventions relating to the Rights of the Child and  
   the Migrant Workers. We emphasized in different UN fora the  
   importance of the World Community acceding to the International  
   Covenants on Human Rights, to the International Covenant on  
   Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and to the  
   Convention on the Elimination on Racial Discrimination. 
    
<br><br>   In the UN Commission on Human Rights, India participated  
actively in the 42nd session of the Commission which was held in  
   Geneva in February March 1986. In this session as Chairman of the  
   Non-aligned Countries, India played an important role in co- 
   ordinating their position on the traditional resolutions on  
   Southern Africa, the Middle East, Ethiopia as well as on the  
   Right to Development. India presented the draft resolution on  
   Lebanon and Palestine on behalf of the Arab group. The leader of  
   the Indian delegation paid a tribute to late Mr. Olaf Palme,  
   former premier of Sweden, on behalf of the Asian and Non-aligned  
   group. In its interventions during the proceedings of the  
   session, the Indian delegation expressed its great concern at the  
   continued deterioration in the human rights situation in many  
   parts of the world, and also contributed to the discussion on  
   different aspects of standard setting in the field of human  
   rights. This included our contribution to the discussion on the  
   Right to Development, the imperative need for a New International  
   Economic Order, the relationship between Human Rights and  
   Scientific and Technological Development and the Declaration on  
   the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination  
   based on Religion or Belief. 
    
<br><br>During the deliberations, India highlighted the increasing  
gravity of the Human Rights situation in Southern Africa, the  
   continued occupation of Namibia and the efforts to intimidate and  
   destabilise the Frontline States. In respect of the situation in  
   Southern Africa, India called for the application of  
   comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa  
   without any reservation motivated by economic, political or  
   strategic considerations in order not only to induce a change in  
   South Africa, but also to put an end to its destabilisation  
   policy directed against the Frontline States and to bring 
<br>-62&gt; 
<br> 
<br>independence to Namibia. India also called for the immediate and  
   unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all the other freedom  
   fighters in South Africa and Namibia. Our delegation invited more  
   countries to accede to the International Convention on the  
   Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and stressed  
   the necessity of providing moral and material support to SWAPO,  
   the ANC and all other freedom fighters in Southern Africa who  
   were campaigning not only for their own freedom and independence  
   but to uphold a cause dear to all humanity. India also  
   highlighted the suffering inflicted upon the Arabs, especially  
   Palestinians, in the territories occupied by Israel. India  
   together with several other country's delegations as well as a  
   large number of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) intervened  
   in the debate on the situation of the Tamils in Sri Lanka during  
   the 42nd session of the Commission. Our delegation reiterated the  
   deep and abiding interest of the Indian Government in restoring  
   communal amity in Sri Lanka with whom we have maintained  
   traditionally close and cordial relations. We indicated our  
   opposition to all forms of violence and our firm support to the  
   unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. We also pointed out  
   that India will continue its endeavour to ensure that the parties  
   to the ethnic violence in Sri Lanka are brought together to  
   achieve a viable political solution without any further delay and  
   loss of life. 
<br> 
<br>   In the 41st session of the UN General Assembly, India played  
   its traditionally significant role in the deliberations of the  
   Third Committee. In the Third Committee, 67 draft resolutions  
   were adopted, 46 without a vote and 21 by recorded votes. The  
   Committee also adopted 10 draft decisions, 9 without a vote and  
   one by a recorded vote. We co-sponsored, among others,  
   resolutions relating to the future work of the Committee on the  
   Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Sub-Commission for the  
   Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and the  
   UN Working Group on Migrant Workers. The resolution initiated by  
   India on the "National Institutions for the Promotion and  
   Protection of Human Rights" was also adopted by consensus in the  
   General Assembly. In our interventions in the Third Committee, we  
   highlighted the acute distress and suffering of the Palestinians  
   in the territories occupied by Israel, the colonization of  
   Namibia, our abhorrence of the system of apartheid in South  
   Africa and our support to the people of that country in the  
   legitimate struggle for their rights. 
<br>-63&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   By far of the most important development in the Third  
   Committee was the adoption, with only one negative vote, of a  
   declaration on the Right to Development. India had been closely  
   associated with the long negotiations in the General Assembly and  
   in the Human Rights Commission which preceded the adoption of  
   this declaration. We believe that the adoption of this delaration  
   with positive votes from some Western countries will constitute  
   one of the most important initiatives of the United Nations  
   towards innovative standard setting and codification in the field  
   of human rights. 
<br> 
<br>Activities of the Non-aligned Movement 
<br> 
<br>   The Non-aligned Movement (NAM) remained a vital dimension of  
   India's foreign policy during the period under review. As  
   Chairman of the Movement since the New Delhi Summit of 1983,  
   India has played a crucial role in the Movement. Our efforts  
   during the three years of our Chairmanship have aimed at  
   strengthening the unity of the Non-aligned Countries and their  
   capacity for concerted action in fulfilment of the original  
   principles and objectives of the Movement. With this end in view,  
   India has worked to expand the area of consensus among the Non- 
   aligned Countries. On issues where differences of perception have  
   come to surface, India attempted to keep the process of dialogue  
   and consultations alive. 
<br> 
<br>   In recent years, the Non-aligned Movement has focussed on  
   nuclear disarmament, the struggle against racism and colonialism  
   in Southern Africa and on building a co-operative international  
   economic and political order based on equality and justice for  
   all nations. The conflicts raging in several parts of the world  
   such as the Middle East, Central America, the Gulf countries etc.  
   have also been major pre-occupations in the Non-aligned Movement.  
   The principled position of the Non-aligned Countries for  
   resolution of such conflicts and tensions was affirmed at  
   numerous occasions during the Ministerial and other meetings of  
   the Non-aligned Countries. The Co-ordinating Bureau of the  
   Movement at New York functioned on a continuous basis to keep the  
   evolving international economic and political situation under  
   constant review. It held a large number of meetings on the  
   burning issues before the Movement including the situation in  
   Southern Africa, the conflict in Central America and the  
   unresolved tensions and conflicts in the Middle East. 
<br>-64&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The global economic crisis and the severe difficulties faced  
   by developing countries particularly in the areas of external  
   debt, reduced financial flows, the fall in commodity prices,  
   fluctuating exchange rates and rising protectionism in the  
   developed world have been the major questions on the economic  
   side of the agenda of the Non-aligned Countries. While, on the  
   one hand, the Non-aligned Countries continued their efforts in  
   various international fora to actualise the goal of a New  
   International Economic Order, parallely there was a growing  
   emphasis on South-South Co-operation. The Action Programme for  
   Economic Co-operation of the Non-aligned Countries adopted at the  
   New Delhi Summit provided the blueprint for a growing interaction  
   and exchange among the Non-aligned Countries in several areas of  
   co-operation. 
<br> 
<br>   In preparation for the Eighth Summit of the Non-aligned  
   Countries at Harare in August-September 1986, India as the  
   Chairman of the Movement hosted two major meetings in New Delhi  
   in 1986. The Fifth meeting of the Co-ordinating Countries in  
   April 1986 reviewed progress in diverse sectors unde the Action  
   Programme for Economic Co-operation and evolved outlines for  
   future action in different sectors. Later in the month, New Delhi  
   was the venue for a Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating  
   Bureau, which undertook a comprehensive review of the  
   international political and economic situation. The deliberations  
   at the Bureau Meeting in New Delhi proved to be a valuable input  
   in the work of the non-aligned leaders at the Harare Summit. 
<br> 
<br>   The Harare Summit in August-September 1986 coincided with the  
   25th Anniversary of the Non-aligned Movement and gave that event  
   a special significance. A special commemorative Declaration was  
   adopted on the occasion at Harare which reaffirmed the original  
   principles of the Movement and their continuing relevance in the  
   present international context. 
<br> 
<br>   Southern African issues were in the forefront of the agenda of  
   the Harare Summit and saw the launching of several useful  
   initiatives to combat South Africa's policies of apartheid and  
   its illegal occupation of Namibia. Apart from identifying a wide  
   range of selective measures against South Africa, the Harare  
   Summit also established the AFRICA (Action for Resisting  
   Invasion, Colonialism and Apartheid) Fund with the objectives of  
   assisting the Frontline States and the liberation movements in  
   Southern Africa to withstand South 
<br>-65&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Africa's acts of aggression and economic sabotage. India was  
   entrusted with the Chairmanship of the nine-member Fund  
   Committee. In the months since Harare, considerable groundwork  
   has been prepared for the AFRICA Fund including a meeting at the  
   level of senior officials in Lusaka in November 1986 which  
   commenced preparations for finalising the Fund's work programme  
   at the Summit in January 1987. It was also decided at Harare to  
   set-up a Committee of Foreign Ministers to canvass support for  
   the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South  
   Africa which was mandated to visit certain key industrialised  
   countries in this connection. The Minister for External Affairs  
   participated in the Mission of this Committee to some West  
   European capitals and to Japan undertaken in October-November  
   1986 in pursuance of this mandate. 
<br> 
<br>   At the Eighth Summit Conference of the Non-aligned Countries  
   at Harare in September 1986, the Chairmanship of the Non-aligned  
   Movement passed to Zimbabwe. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  
   addressed the Summit as the outgoing Chairman of the Movement as  
   well as the Commemorative Session held at Harare on 1 September  
   1986 to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Movement. The Summit  
   paid warm tributes to India's contribution during the term of her  
   Chairmanship to the unity and strength of the Non-aligned  
   Countries. 
<br> 
<br>   The Harare Summit also addressed a joint appeal to the  
   President of the United States and the General Secretary of the  
   Communist Party of the Soviet Union on nuclear disarmament. On  
   the economic front, the Summit reviewed the prevailing  
   international economic situation especially its adverse  
   consequences for the developing countries. One concrete  
   initiative at Harare related to the approval of the establishment  
   of a Standing Ministerial Committee of the Non-aligned Countries  
   on North-South economic issues. While reaffirming the Movement's  
   commitment to a New International Economic Order, the Harare  
   Summit also underlined the need for greater South-South Co- 
   operation and approved a wide ranging Action Programme for  
   Economic Co-operation among the Non-aligned Countries which spans  
   several areas of activity. </td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td>The situation in Southern Africa remained a major focus of  
   attention in the Non-aligned Movement and India sought, as  
   Chairman, to sustain and give direction to this momentum. The Co- 
   ordinating Bureau met on 22 May 
   <br>-66&gt; 
<br> 
<br>1986 following the South African aggression against Botswana,  
Zambia and Zimbabwe and adopted a communique expressing profound  
   indignation and grave concern at these unprovoked attacks. The  
   Non-aligned Movemen was also associated with the World Conference  
   on Sanctions against South Africa held in Paris in June 1986 when  
   a message from the Chairman stressing an urgent need for  
   mandatory sanctions against South Africa was sent to the  
   Conference. The Chairman also addressed a message to the  
   International Conference on Immediate Independence for Namibia  
   held in Vienna in July 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The Co-ordinating Bureau met on several occasions during the  
   year under review to consider the situation in Central America.  
   The meetings considered developments in Central America and  
   issued communiques expressing grave concern at the deterioration  
   of the situation in the sub-region around Nicaragua, expressing  
   grave concern and regret at the approval by the US Congress of  
   funds for the mercenary groups seeking the overthrow of the  
   Government of Nicaragua and noted with satisfaction the judgement  
   of the International Court of Justice delivered on 27 June 1986.  
   It also appealed to the United States to abide by it immediately  
   and unconditionally. 
<br> 
<br>   Within the Security Council, the Non-aligned Countries  
   actively participated in the consideration of the situation in  
   the Middle East. The Non-aligned Committee of Eight continued its  
   efforts through informal consultations for an International Peace  
   Conference on the Middle East under the UN auspices. It submitted  
   a report to the Harare Summit where Zimbabwe was included as an  
   additional member and new Chairman of the Committee. 
<br> 
<br>   The continuing fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq  
   received constant attention in the Movement. Following a renewed  
   escalation in hostilities in February 1986, the official  
   spokesman of the Government of India made a statement on behalf  
   of the Chairman of NAM calling upon the two countries to move  
   away from the path of conflict and confrontation towards a  
   negotiated peaceful settlement. At the Ministerial Meetings of  
   the Co-ordinating Bureau in New Delhi in April 1986, the Chairman  
   of the meeting issued a statement renewing the urgent appeal  
   addressed by the Chairman of the Movement at the Seventh Summit  
   in New Delhi in 1983. 
<br>-67&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The emerging tensions in the Mediterranean region also engaged  
   the Movement during the period under review. Several meetings of  
   the Bureau were  held during the year to consider the grave  
   situation facing the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  
   It issued statements expressing grave concern over the situation  
   in the region, the interception and forcible diversion by Israel  
   on 4 February 1986 of a Libyan civilian aircraft in international  
   air-space and the provocations and use of force against the  
   Jamahiriya, demanding urgent cessation of military operations. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau in New  
   Delhi held a special session and adopted a communique on 15 April  
   1986 noting with deep shock and profound indignation the armed  
   attacks of the United States of America against the Libyan Arab  
   Jamahiriya. In pursuance of the mandate of this Ministerial  
   Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau, the Foreign Ministers of  
   India, Cuba and Yugoslavia and representatives of the Congo,  
   Ghana and Senegal visited Tripoli and handed over to Colonel  
   Muammar Al-Qadhafi the text of the communique adopted by the  
   emergency Ministerial Meeting held on 15 April 1986 and  
   reiterated to him the Movement's solidarity with the Socialist  
   People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Also, as mandated by the New  
   Delhi Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau, the  
   Ministerial Group delivered the text of the communique to the  
   President of the Security Council and the Secretary General of  
   the United Nations and expressed to them the concern of the  
   Movement and its solidarity with the Socialist People's Libyan  
   Arab Jamahiriya. The Group participated in the Security Council  
   session held in this context on 24 April 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The Non-aligned Countries continued their efforts for the  
   establishment of a new international economic order and kept the  
   global economic situation, especially its impact on developing  
   countries, under constant review. As Chairman of the Movement,  
   India drew attention of the leaders of the Industrialised Seven  
   on the eve of the Tokyo Summit of May 1986 to the continuing  
   global economic crisis and the concern of the developing  
   countries at the increasing protectionist policies of the  
   industrialised countries. 
<br>-68&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   At the Fifth Meeting of the Co-ordinating Countries of the  
   Action Programme for Economic Co-operation of the Non-aligned  
   Countries held in New Delhi in April 1986, the Chairman of NAM  
   and the Chairman of the Group of 77 presented a joint report on  
   harmonisation and co-ordination of the Caracas Programme of  
   Action of G-77 and the Action Programme for the Economic Co- 
   operation of the Non-aligned Countries. The Non-aligned Movement  
   was also represented at the Inter-governmental Follow-up and Co- 
   ordination Committee (IFCC) Meeting at Cairo in August 1986 with  
   a view to achieving such harmonisation. 
<br> 
<br>   Efforts were continued to accelerate progress in South-South  
   Co-operation and further the implementation of the Action  
   Programme for Economic Co-operation approved at the Seventh  
   Summit. A large number of meetings in different spheres were  
   organised to give effect to the recommendations of the Summit. 
<br> 
<br>   The Fourth Conference of the Non-aligned News agency Pool was  
   held in Havana from 17 to 22 March 1986 which adopted the Havana  
   Programme of Action. 
<br> 
<br>   The Inter-governmental Council in the field of Information met  
   at the Ministerial level in Dakar in January and undertook a  
   comprehensive review of the Programme of Action adopted at the  
   Jakarta Meeting of Information Ministers. 
<br> 
<br>   An expert-level meeting of Co-ordinating Countries in the  
   field of Sports was convened in Havana, Cuba, in February 1986.  
   This was followed by a Ministerial Meeting in the field of Sports  
   and Physical Education at Pyongyang in July 1986 which adopted a  
   Plan of Action for co-operation in this sphere. 
<br> 
<br>   An expert-level meeting of Co-ordinating Countries in the  
   sector of Health was held in Havana, Cuba, in March 1986. 
<br>-69&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The first meeting of the co-ordinators in the Environment  
   sectors was held in Nairobi in March 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   Madagascar hosted an expert-level meeting of co-ordinators in  
   the sector of Monetary and Financial Co-operation in March 1986  
   to consider the proposal of the President of Madagascar on  
   monetary and financial co-operation among the non-aligned and  
   other developing countries. 
<br> 
<br>   A Ministerial level meeting in the sphere of Education and  
   Culture was held in Havana in April 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   An expert-level meeting in the field of Food and Agriculture  
   was held in Rabat, Morocco, in July 1986 which adopted a  
   Programme of Action aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in food  
   and agriculture. 
<br> 
<br>Commonwealth 
<br> 
<br>   India was actively associated with the Commonwealth activities  
   spanning a wide range of subjects under the Commonwealth  
   umbrella. The most important pre-occupation of the Commonwealth  
   during the period under review was the situation in Southern  
   Africa, in particular the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa  
   and the question of Namibian independence. In this context,  
   mention must be made of the Eminent Persons' Group (EPG)  
   established through consultations among the leaders of Australia,  
   the Bahamas, Canada, India, the UK, Zambia and Zimbabwe and the  
   Commonwealth Secretary General in accordance with the Nassau  
   Accord on Southern Africa and the London Review Meeting of  
   Commonwealth leaders during August 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   Sardar Swaran Singh, former Minister for External Affairs, was  
   nominated by the Prime Minister to the Eminent Persons' Group.  
   The Group visited South Africa and the Frontline States on  
   several occasions and undertook wide 
<br>-70&gt; 
<br> 
<br>ranging consultation with the representatives of the South  
   African Government, leaders of the Frontline States,  
   representatives of the liberation movements in Southern Africa as  
   well as a wide cross section of leaders of public opinion in  
   South Africa with a view to facilitating a dialogue for the  
   establishment of a non-racial and representative government in  
   that country. In its report to the Commonwealth leaders in June  
   1986, the EPG came to the unanimous conclusion that there was no  
   genuine intention on the part of the South African Government to  
   enter into negotiations with the representatives of the black  
   majority for the establishment of non-racial and representative  
   Government in South Africa. While drawing attention to the  
   prospect of a blood bath in South Africa, the report stressed the  
   need for meaningful sanctions by the international community  
   against South Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   The Prime Minister of India participated in the London Review  
   Meeting of the Commonwealth leaders held from 3 to 5 August 1986  
   under the terms of the Nassau Accord on Southern Africa. The  
   leaders of Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, India, Zimbabwe and  
   Zambia agreed on the immediate adoption of additional selective  
   measures against South Africa in addition to those outlined in  
   para 7 of the Nassau Accord to put further pressure on the  
   Pretoria regime. The UK, however, disassociated itself from this  
   agreement and confined itself to action against South Africa in  
   the Commonwealth context to a voluntary ban on new investments  
   and on promotion of tourism to South Africa and to the readiness  
   to abide by any EEC decisions regarding import of coal, iron,  
   steel and uranium from South Africa. 
<br> 
<br>   While Southern African issues were at the forefront of the  
   Commonwealth concerns, a large number of meetings were held in  
   other areas including Ministerial Meetings in the fields of  
   Finance, Law and Health. The meeting of Law Ministers in Harare  
   in July-August 1986 adopted the Commonwealth Scheme on Mutual  
   Assistance relating to Criminal Matters to facilitate  
   Commonwealth Co-operation to combat illicit drug trafficking etc. 
    
<br><br>At Nassau, the question of the vulnerability of small States  
had emerged as a major concern of the Commonwealth in the wake of  
   the report of the consultative group established at the New Delhi  
   CHOGM (1983). In accordance 
   <br>-71&gt; 
<br> 
<br>with the decision taken at the Nassau Summit, an official level  
meeting was held in London in October 1986 to evolve a  
   Commonwealth Plan of Action to address the vulnerability of small  
   States. 
<br> 
<br>   The biennial meeting of the Commonwealth senior officials was  
   held in Dhaka from 3 to 5 December 1986. The meeting reviewed  
   progress in the implementation of decisions of the Nassau Summit  
   in the run-up to the forthcoming Summit to be held in Vancouver  
   in October 1987. In the wide ranging exchange of views at Dhaka,  
   the issues of Southern Africa, Multilateral Trade Negotiations- 
   Prospects for the Uruguay Round, International Co-operation to  
   Combat Terrorism, the Problem of Drug Trafficking etc. figured  
   prominently. The meeting also reviewed progress under the  
   Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC) as well as  
   other areas of Commonwealth Co-operation such as the Commonwealth  
   Foundation, the Commonwealth Youth Programme etc.

<br>International Law: Developments and Activities 
<br> </td></tr>
<tr><td>During 1986, the Preparatory Commission for the International  
   Sea-bed Authority and the International Tribunal for the Law of  
   the Sea (PREPCOM) continued its work. Its Informal Plenary and  
   its four Special Commissions continued discussion of the subjects  
   allocated to them. It held its fourth session in two parts, viz.,  
   March-April 1986 in Kingston, Jamaica, and August-September 1986  
   in New York. During these meetings, the Chairman Mr. Warioba and  
   the Acting Chairman Mr. Jhingran of India continued their efforts  
   towards the resolution of conflicts relating to overlapping of  
   application areas. At its session in New York held in August- 
   September 1986, the Preparatory Commission as a whole endorsed an  
   understanding known as the Arusha Understanding between the four  
   pioneer investors, which sought to resolve the matter of  
   overlapping claims. This understanding was concluded in Arusha in  
   February 1986. Pursuant to the endorsement of the Arusha  
   Understanding all the four pioneer investors shall be submitting  
   revised co-ordinates of their application areas to the  
   Preparatory Commission to enable it to register application of  
   India, France, Japan and the USSR pending before it. 
<br>-72&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   At its 41st session, the General Assembly of the United  
   Nations adopted a resolution on the Law of the Sea, whereby it  
   expressed, inter alia, satisfaction at the important decision of  
   the Preparatory Commission on 5 September 1986 which had created  
   conditions for the early implementation of the regime for pioneer  
   investors contained in Resolution II of the Third United Nations  
   Conference on the Law of the Sea, thus facilitating the process  
   of registration of applicants for pioneer investors status at the  
   next session of the Preparatory Commission. 
<br> 
<br>   On 23 December 1986, the Agreement between India and Burma on  
   the Delimitation of Maritime Boundary in the Andaman Sea, in the  
   Coco Channel and in the Bay of Bengal, was signed in Rangoon by  
   the Minister for External Affairs, Shri N.D. Tiwari, on behalf of  
   India and Minister for Foreign Affairs, U Ye Goung, on behalf of  
   Burma. 
<br> 
<br>   The maritime boundary between the two countries in the Andaman  
   Sea, in the Coco Channel and in the Bay of Bengal is formed by a  
   single continuous line whose course has been determined on the  
   basis of the equi-distance principle. The Agreement stipulates  
   that the extension of the maritme boundary in the Andaman Sea up  
   to the maritime boundary tri-junction point between Burma, India  
   and Thailand will be done subsequently after the tri-junction  
   point is established by Agreement between the three countries.  
   The Agreement also provides that the extension of the Maritime  
   Boundary in the Bay of Bengal beyond 200 Nautical Miles shall be  
   done subsequently. 
<br> 
<br>   The Agreement recognizes the sovereignty of each party over  
   all islands falling on its side of the maritime boundary,  
   including those that may emerge in the future. It further  
   recognizes the sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions of  
   the parties in their respective maritime zones in accordance with  
   the relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on  
   the Law of the Sea. The Agreement is subject to ratification, and  
   the Instruments of Ratification are to be exchanged in New Delhi  
   as soon as possible. 
<br> 
<br>   The 41st session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  
   held elections for the International Law Commission (ILC) on 14  
   November 1986. 
   <br>-73&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Fifty two candidates from five Regional Groups of the UN  
contested the elections. For the Asian Group there were eleven  
   candidates for the seven seats available. Dr. P. S. Rao,  
   Director, Legal and Treaties Division, Ministry of External  
   Affairs, was elected as a member of the ILC. 
<br> 
<br>   The UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) held  
   its 19th session in New York from 23 June to 11 July 1986. India  
   participated in the session as a member of the Commission. Shri  
   P.K. Kartha, Law Secretary, was the Chairman of the session. The  
   Commission considered the draft Convention on International Bills  
   of Exchange and International Promissory Notes prepared by its  
   Working Group on International Negotiable Instruments. The draft  
   Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International  
   Promissory Notes finalised by the Commission shall be considered  
   again by the Working Group on International Negotiable  
   Instruments at its 15th session to be held in New York from 16 to  
   27 February 1987. The draft Convention finalised by this Working  
   Group shall then be considered by the Commission at its 20th  
   session to be held in Vienna from 20 July to 14 August 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   UNCITRAL Working Group on International Contract Practices  
   held its 10th session in Vienna from 1 to 12 December 1986. India  
   was a member of this Working Group and it participated in its  
   deliberations. The Indian delegate was elected Rapporteur of this  
   Working Group. The Working Group has prepared the text of a draft  
   Convention on the Liability of Operators of Transport Terminals.  
   The operator is defined to mean a person who undertakes to take  
   in-charge goods involved in international carriage in order to  
   provide or toprocure transport related services with respect to  
   the goods in an area under his control. The Convention is  
   applicable only in relation to the goods which are involved in  
   international carriage. The draft text of the Convention on the  
   liability of the operators of transport terminals prepared by the  
   Working Group shall be considered again by it at its next session  
   in January 1988. 
<br> 
<br>   The Eighth session of UNCITRAL Working Group on the New  
   International Economic Order was held in Vienna from 17 to 27  
   March 1986. The session was attended by 27 member-States,  
   including India, and 28 observers. The Working, Group considered  
   draft chapters of the Legal Guide on Drawing up International  
   Contracts for Construction of Industrial Works. The guide 
   <br>-74&gt; 
<br> 
<br>identifies the legal issues involved in such contracts and  
suggests possible solutions to assist parties, in particular from  
   developing countries, in their negotiations. 
    
<br><br>The Legal Sub-Committee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful  
Uses of Outer Space held its 25th session in Geneva from 24 March  
   to 11 April 1986 and considered legal issues relating to remote  
   sensing of the earth from space, nuclear power sources in outer  
   space, the definition and delimitation of outer space and the  
   geostationary orbit. 
<br> 
<br>   Regarding remote sensing of the earth by satellite, a set of  
   15 draft principles, the product of 12 years work, were approved  
   by the Legal Sub-Committee. 
<br> 
<br>   On nuclear power sources, the Working Group reached consensus  
   on two principles relating to notification of re-entry and  
   assistance to States. 
<br> 
<br>   Regarding definition and delimitation of outer space, some  
   delegations expressed the view that for legal and practical  
   reasons it was urgent to have a clear demarcation between air- 
   space and outer space and that an international convention would  
   be the appropriate response. Those delegations said that a good  
   basis for further work was the Soviet Union proposal for a  
   multilateral agreement establishing the beginning of outer space  
   at an altitude not exceeding 110 km above sea-level and allowing  
   for innocent passage at lower altitudes through the air-space of  
   one State of another State's space object for the purpose of  
   reaching orbit or returning to earth. 
    
<br><br>   Other countries took the view that the need for definition or  
delimitation had not yet been established and that in any case  
   the location of a demarcation point would be arbitrary as no  
   clear scientific basis for fixing a particular altitude had been  
   established. 
<br> 
<br>   Regarding the question of geostationary orbit, some  
   delegations described it as an integral part of outer space as a  
   whole. Equatorial countries stated that the orbit was a limited  
   natural resource calling for a special legal regime. 
<br>-75&gt; 
<br> 
<br>These countries felt that they should have special rights and  
   responsibilities with respect to the segments of the  
   geostationary orbit superjacent to their territories. Some other  
   delegations felt that the physical characteristics of the orbit  
   derived from earth as a whole. There was no basis for any State  
   or group of States to claim jurisdiction or preferential rights  
   over any part of the orbit. Still others stated that the Sub- 
   Committee should first determine the legal status of the  
   geostationary orbit and then draw other conclusions regarding its  
   use. 
<br> 
<br>   The United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties between  
   States and International Organisations or between International  
   Organisations was held at Vienna from 18 February to 21 March  
   1986 to consider the draft articles on the topic adopted by the  
   International Law Commission at its 34th session. It is  
   significant to note that in drafting the articles, the  
   International Law Commission had largely drawn on the provisions  
   of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which  
   applies to treaties between States. 
<br> 
<br>   97 States including India participated in the Conference.  
   International inter-governmental organisations that have  
   traditionally been invited as observers at legal codification  
   conferences convened under the auspices of the United Nations  
   were also invited to participate in the Conference. The  
   Conference adopted the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties  
   between States and International Organisations or between  
   International Organisations on 20 March 1986. The Convention is  
   subject to ratification by States and by Namibia, represented by  
   the United Nations Council for Namibia and to acts of formal  
   confirmation by international organisations. The Convention  
   completes the process on codification in the field of Law of  
   Treaties. On the whole, the Convention embodies the principle of  
   uniformity and non-discrimination between States and  
   international organisations as parties to a treaty. 
<br> 
<br>   Until the 40th session of the UN General Assembly, the Soviet  
   Union insisted upon drafting of a treaty on non-use of force in  
   international relations. The Western Group opposed this idea.  
   During the 41st session (1986), the USSR changed its position and  
   sought a mandate to draft a declaration as an intermediary step  
   leading to the drafting of a treaty. It did not insist for a  
   treaty on the subject. In the course of the debate in the Sixth  
   Committee on this 
<br>-76&gt; 
<br> 
<br>item, both sides stressed the need for a declaration on the non- 
   use of force in international relations. As a result, the draft  
   resolution on the item was adopted without a vote. The resolution  
   urges the Special Committee to complete a declaration on the  
   item. This is a good omen which is expected to lead to conclusion  
   of the work on the item in 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   At its 41st session, the Sixth Committee adopted a resolution  
   on the New International Economic Order (NIEO) co-sponsored by 14  
   States, including India, which requests the Secretary General to  
   seek proposals of member-States relating to the most appropriate  
   procedures to be adopted with regard to the consideration of the  
   analytical study prepared by the UNITAR as well as the  
   codification and progressive development of the principles and  
   norms of international law relating to the new international  
   economic order. The important development in the drafting of this  
   resolution was inclusion of the word 'codification' in operative  
   paragraph 3 as suggested by India, which would be very helpful  
   for the developing countries. It is pertinent to mention that  
   West European States have taken the stand that there was no right  
   such as right to development aid. The developing countries on the  
   other hand stressed the urgent need to establish a machinery in  
   order to implement the recommendations made by UNITAR.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>A South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC)  
   Ministerial Meeting of International Economic Issues was held in  
   Islamabad in April 1986, in pursuance of a decision of the First  
   SAARC Summit in Dhaka. The Islamabad Meeting had the aim of  
   formulating a joint position on important issues relating to the  
   objective of the establishment of a new International Economic  
   Order, and the improvement of the world trading systems under the  
   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and related issues.  
   The meeting adopted a Declaration on various major issues in the  
   areas of money, finance, trade, development, debt,  
   industrialisation, agriculture, etc., including a formulation on  
   the Multilateral Trade Negotiations (MTN) which proved very  
   useful in subsequent meetings where this issue was considered. 
<br> 
<br>   The USA and Japan, supported by other major industrialised  
   countries, initiated moves for launching a new round of  
   multilateral trade negotiations in GATT since 1983. The US has  
   urged that the proposed New Round includes new sectors such as  
   services, intellectual property and trade related aspects of  
   investment. The developing countries have opposed this proposal  
   as they maintained that services, etc., were not within the  
   jurisdiction of GATT. The Eighth Non-aligned Summit emphatically  
   declared that no linkage should be established between the access  
   for goods of developing countries and the concessions by them in  
   the area of services. A special Ministerial Meeting of the  
   Contracting Parties of GATT was held at Punta del Este in Uruguay  
   in September 1986. Consensus was achieved by both sides touching  
   some steps. The Ministerial Meeting accepted a two-track approach  
   to the new MTN round to be called the Uruguay Round. A  
   distinction has been drawn between negotiations on trade in goods  
   which are to be conducted by the Contracting Parties to the GATT  
   and the negotiations on trade in services which are to be  
   conducted under the authority of a separate Ministerial Meeting

<br>independent of GATT. Thus developing countries agreed to engage  
   in multilateral negotiations on services but developed countries  
   accepted that they would not be in GATT. The Punta del Este  
   Meeting also recorded its   determination to halt and reverse  
   protectionism and remove distortions in   trade. The Declaration  
   took into account the serious difficulties faced by the commodity  
   markets and underlined the need for facilitating the debt ridden  
   countries to meet their obligations and the need for effective  
   action in the inter-related areas of money, finance and trade,  
   besides reaffirming the principle of differential and more  
   favourable treatment to benefit the developing countries without  
   any reciprocity in negotiations with developing countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Developing countries have become increasingly aware of the  
   advantage of fostering close economic co-operation among  
   themselves for mutual benefit. The concept of Economic Co- 
   operation among Developing Countries (ECDC) has been given added  
   urgency due to the continuing deterioration in the world economic  
   climate and the lack of progress in the North-South dialogue on  
   major issues relating to international co-operation and  
   development. A major development in ECDC was the second High  
   Level Meeting on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  
   in Cairo in August 1986, to review the progress under the Caracas  
   Programme of Action (CPA) in the last five years and to give  
   directions for future work for the rest of the decade to improve  
   the mechanisms available to the Group of 77 for the purpose. The  
   meeting reaffirmed the relevance of ECDC as an indispensible  
   means of restructuring international economic relationships for  
   the benefit of the developing countries and reiterated the  
   pivotal role of South-South Co-operation in their efforts to  
   improve their economies and underlined the political commitment  
   of all developing countries to the goal of collective self- 
   reliance and for that purpose elaborating and intensifying their  
   ECDC endeavours. The Cairo Meeting approved two documents :<br> 
 (i)the Cairo Declaration on ECDC and <br> 
(ii)the Report of the High  
   Level Meeting. The Declaration, inter alia, recommended that the  
   scale of priorities be outlined for the selection of programmes  
   and projects to be implemented within a fixed time framework. It  
   was also decided to ensure that the ECDC becomes self-generating  
   and self-financing. The Report of the meeting reviewed the  
   implementation of the Caracas Programme of Action, supporting  
   mechanisms, and the ECDC Trust Fund. The next session of the  
   Inter-Governmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee (IFCC)  
   would undertake a sectoral review of the CPA with a view to  
   further its implementation. A key initiative under the CPA is the  
   Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP). 
<br>-79&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The establishment of the Global System of Trade Preferences is  
   perhaps the most important ECDC initiative taken. India hosted a  
   Ministerial Meeting on the GSTP in Delhi in July 1985 where the  
   proposal received significant political impetus. The Meeting  
   agreed on a firm time-table for the launching of GSTP.  
   Subsequently, an Inter-Ministerial Level Meeting was held in  
   Brasilia in May 1986, where the negotiating phase of the GSTP was  
   launched. 
<br> 
<br>   India continued its efforts to promote and enhance economic  
   and technical co-operation withd eveloping countries in the  
   spirit of South-South Co-operation, to which India remains firmly  
   committed. Apart from providing assistance under multilateral  
   schemes such as the Colombo Plan and the Special Commonwealth  
   African Assistance Plan, bilateral assistance to developing  
   countries has been provided through the Indian Technical and  
   Economic Co-operation (ITEC) Programme, operated by the Ministry  
   of External Affairs. The ITEC Programme launched in 1964 with an  
   outlay of Rs. 4.46 lakhs has steadily been expanding over the  
   years to Rs. 9 crores in 1986-87 to cover nearly 60 countries in  
   Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
<br> 
<br>   The main forms of technical co-operation under the ITCE  
   Programme are providing training in India in various fields,  
   deploying Indian experts abroad, undertaking feasibility and  
   techno-economic studies, sponsoring visits of experts  
   delegations, organising workshops and special training programmes  
   and the supply of equipment. 
<br> 
<br>   As in the previous years, during 1986-87, 700 slots were  
   earmarked for nominees of developing countries for training in  
   specialised Indian Institutes and nearly 150 Indian experts have  
   been placed in developing countries on short or long term  
   assignments. 
<br> 
<br>   Some of the other ITEC activities during 1986-87 have been :  
   the visit of a two-member team of the National Council for Cement  
   and Building Materials to Panama to provide consultancy in the  
   manufacture of cement using lime and rice husk; the visit of an  
   official techno-economic delegation to Nicaragua in April 1986  
   for identification of specific projects for Indian assistance;  
   the visit of a three-member Medical Specialists team (Group-I) to  
   the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen for the treatment of  
   patients; and two training programmes 
<br>-80&gt; 
<br> 
<br>in Vietnam of two weeks duration each conducted by a team from  
   the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade. A six-week training  
   programme in Anguilla was conducted by a two-member team of the  
   Institute of Secretariat Training and Management. Two delegations  
   from Vietnam visited India for identifying joint research  
   programmes in rice cultivation and in buffalo breeding. Two high- 
   level delegations came from Afghanistan for gaining familiarity  
   in the field of Small Scale Industry and in Indian banking  
   methods. A two-member team from Mauritius visited museums in the  
   North, East and South to study and submit a report detailing  
   requirements for the ethnic museum to be set up in Mauritius.  
   Afghanistan, Mauritius and Vietnam were provided assistance  
   within the framework of the joint commissions with these  
   countries. A Rural Technology Training-cum-Demonstration Centre  
   has been set up in Dakar under the auspices of the Economic  
   Commission for Africa (ECA). 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministry of External Affairs also assisted foreign  
   governments in recruiting Indian experts on a bilateral basis. It  
   also made its contribution towards the promotion of Indian  
   economic interests through its representation in bodies such as  
   the Inter-Ministerial Joint Venture Committee, the EXIM Bank, the  
   Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation (ECGC), the Federation of  
   Indian Engineering Organisation (FIEO), the Indian Institute of  
   Foreign Trade (IIFT), the Project and Equipment Corporation  
   (PEC), the Overseas Construction Council of India (OCCI), the  
   Educational Consultants India Ltd. (EdCIL) and the Hospital  
   Services Consultancy Corporation India Ltd. (HSCCIL).

<tr><td>During the year under review, the Policy Planning Division  
   continued to maintain contact with the Area Study Centres of  
   various Universities where scholars are involved in research and  
   studies of international relations. It also participated in the  
   meetings of the Directors of the Area Study Centres. In order to  
   promote greater interaction between the Ministry of External  
   Affairs and academic institutions, the officers of the Ministry  
   took part in a number of scholarly seminars and conferences  
   relating to foreign policy and international affairs. The  
   Division has fully utilised its modest Budget grant by extending  
   financial assistance to various organisations/associations for  
   organising seminars/conferences on international affairs. 
<br> 
<br>   A seminar on "Strategic Environment into the 1990s" was  
   jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and the  
   Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) from 3 to 5  
   January 1987. The seminar brought together, in close interaction,  
   senior officials from the concerned Ministries/Departments. The  
   Division also jointly organised a workshop on "Security  
   Environment of South Asia" with the Jawaharlal Nehru University  
   (JNU) from 17 to 19 January 1987. This workshop is the first of  
   its kind and should prove to be stimulating. 
<br> 
<br>   Among the other seminars and symposia, which were partly  
   financed by the Policy Planning Division, particular mention may  
   be made of the following: 
<br> 
<br>   (i) "Second Annual Conference of the World Women  
   Parliamentarians for Peace," organised by the W.W.P.P., from 2 to  
   3 April 1986 at New Delhi. 
<br>-82&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   (ii) Seminar on "NAM &amp; Asian Peace," organised by the Indian  
   Council for Regional Affairs, on 12 April 1986 at New Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   (iii) "Indo-FRG Seminar" organised by the Institute for  
   Defence Studies and Analyses, from 5 to 8 May 1986 at Srinagar. 
<br> 
<br>   (iv) Seminar on "Nation Building and Development Process :  
   Role of Communication," organised by Indian Institute of Mass  
   Communications, in September-October 1986 at New Delhi. 
<br> 
<br>   (v) One-day Seminar on International Year of Peace, held in  
   New Delhi in October 1986, and four Seminars on International  
   Year of Peace held in cities outside Delhi, organised by the  
   Indian Federation of United Nations Associations, in November- 
   December 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   (vi) Two-day Seminar on International Year of Peace, organised  
   by India International Centre, from 14 to 15 November 1986 at New  
   Delhi.

   Government of Rajasthan, in December 1986 at Jaipur. 
<br> 
<br>   The Historical Division provides research input into the  
   working of the Ministry. The Division has prepared a number of  
   policy papers and background notes on subjects of concern and  
   special interest to India in the external domain. In preparing  
   the studies, the Division interacted with other divisions of the  
   Ministry as well as with other Ministries and Departments in  
   order to impart a multiple perspective to the studies. As in the  
   past, several such studies were circulated to Missions abroad and  
   territorial divisions of the Ministry as well as to other  
   concerned departments and agencies of the Government. 
<br>-83&gt; 
<br> 
      <br>The Historical Division is also responsible for providing  
   historical and technical input in boundary questions. The  
   depiction of India's external boundary in the maps on India  
   published abroad are monitored by the Division and cases of wrong  
depiction of the external boundary of India are taken up with the  
   concerned organisations/countries to ensure remedial action. 
<br> 
<br>   As in earlier years, the Historical Division co-ordinated the  
   work relating to the Annual Report of the Ministry. 
    
<br><br>   To support the research efforts a well stocked Library exists  
which has over one hundred thousand books and documents in its  
   collection. During 1986 alone 1400 books, 300 maps, 650 pamphlets  
   and 31 reels of microfilm were added. The Library subscribes to  
   563 periodicals (447 foreign and 116 Indian) besides 37 daily  
   newspapers (24 foreign and 13 Indian). Back-files of The Hindu  
   (Madras), Bangladesh Observer (Dhaka), Daily Review, Izvestia and  
   Pravda (Moscow), Dawn (Karachi), Pakistan Times (Rawalpindi),  
   Egyptian Gazette (Cairo), Guardian (Rangoon), International  
   Herald Tribune (Hong Kong), Le Monde (Paris), Renmin Ribao, China  
   Daily (Beijing), Sun (Colombo), Suna (Khartoum), Standard  
   (Nairobi) and The Times (London) are being maintained. 
<br> 
<br>   From April 1986 the Library has initiated a computerisation of  
   Documentation/Bibliographic Service. All new documents-books,  
   periodicals, articles etc.-are being fed into an in-house  
   microcomputer to create database on Foreign Affairs. 
<br> 
<br>   The Library is equipped with a microcomputer, a microfilm  
   reader printer and a plain paper photocopier. The Library  
   regularly issues a monthly Chronicle of Events, a Foreign Affairs  
   Documentation Bulletin and an annotated monthly list of books  
   added to the Library.

<tr class="evenRow"><td>During the year under review, the External Publicity (XP)  
   Division made concerted efforts to project the various dimensions  
   of our foreign policy, promote a better understanding of India's  
   economic achievements, industrial and technological potential,  
   cultural heritage and democratic institutions, and also to  
   counter anti-India propaganda by hostile elements. Emphasis was  
   laid on dissemination of information-audio-visual, printed and by  
   personal briefings and contacts-in a persuasive manner to achieve  
   optimum results. The reportage on India in the international  
   media was generally positive. 
<br> 
<br>   The foreign press in Delhi was briefed regularly about India's  
   policy on various issues. Our Missions abroad also kept in  
   regular touch with the foreign media to brief them about the  
   current developments in India and provide them with factual  
   material on the problems being faced by us. To that end, the  
   XP'Division expanded its network of communications to keep our  
   Missions informed on matters of contemporary interest in India in  
   diverse fields through twice daily transmissions. During the year  
   under review, 19 more Missions were provided twice daily  
   transmissions, thus increasing the total number of Missions/posts  
   covered on a daily basis with information bulletins to 73.  
   Besides, 46 Missions receive bi-weekly press cables and 16 posts  
   receive regular information bulletins by diplomatic bag. 
<br> 
<br>   The XP Division undertook the printing and publication of high  
   quality publicity literature in India depicting different facets  
   of India's national life in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese,  
   German and Arabic. These publications have been widely circulated  
   by our Missions abroad and have been found to be extremely  
   popular and useful. 
<br>-85&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Apart from the regular publication of a fortnightly magazine  
   Indian and Foreign Review, its French counterpart Courrier de  
   L'Inde and the monthly Foreign Affairs Record, the XP Division  
   brought out about two dozen elegant publications-some of a  
   regular nature like the Prime Minister's statements on foreign  
   policy, some others of a general nature and some relating to  
   specific occasions to achieve optimum results. For instance,  
   during the year under review, special publications were brought  
   out on the eve of the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-aligned Co- 
   ordination Bureau in April, the Conference on Namibia in July at  
   Vienna, the Eighth Non-aligned Summit at Harare in September, the  
   Frankfurt Book Fair in September with India as the theme, and the  
   SAARC Summit at Bangalore in November. Books and booklets  
   describing India's role as the Chairman of the Non-aligned  
   Movement and India's consistent support to the struggle against  
   Colonialism and Apartheid in Southern Africa were also printed  
   and widely distributed abroad. 
<br> 
<br>   The External Publicity Division is placing increasing emphasis  
   on the circulation of audio-visual material by Indian Missions  
   abroad. All Indian Missions are now being equipped with  
   Television sets and Video Cassette Recorders. Indian Missions  
   abroad have also been provided with Video Libraries depicting  
   India's agricultural, industrial, scientific and technological  
   progress and different facets of our cultural heritage, apart  
   from topics of contemporary interest. In close co-operation with  
   Doordarshan, the External Publicity Division is regularly sending  
   a Television Capsule entitled "India Magazine" every week to all  
   our Missions abroad about developments in India. These Capsules  
   have been widely welcomed and are being extensively used by the  
   National Television Stations in a number of countries for viewing  
   by their public. These programmes are also being lent by our  
   Missions abroad to individuals, cultural organisations and  
   educational institutions for wider impact. These programmes have  
   proved to be extremely useful in catering to the needs of the  
   Indian community and the people of Indian origin abroad. They are  
   being used extensively by the Indian ethnic Television Stations  
   in the USA and in Canada and are being viewed not only by the  
   Indian community but also by other foreign expatriates. 
<br> 
<br>   Keeping in view the increasing popularity of Indian Films  
   across the world, the XP Division has acquired, in nine months  
   ending December 1986, twelve high quality feature films viz.,  
   Janam, Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho, Aghat, Holi, New Delhi Times, Anant  
   Yatra, Yahan Wahan and Bazaar in Hindi, 
<br>-86&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Mukhamukham and Elipathayapa in Malayalam, Accident in Kanada,  
   and Malgudi Days in English. After getting the films sub-titled  
   in English, Spanish, French and Arabic, as the case may be, these  
   have been sent to our Missions abroad for circulation and  
   screening on the Mission's premises. The XP Division also  
   provided our Missions with documentary films produced by the  
   Films Division covering different aspects of India's national  
   life. Film weeks were held in Kathmandu, Colombo, Dhaka, Rangoon,  
   Seoul, Addis Ababa, Algiers, Kinshasa, Brussels, Lisbon, Vienna  
   and Bogota during 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   All our Missions abroad have been equipped with photo  
   libraries containing photographic slides on different facets of  
   developments in India. The Missions are also being regularly  
   supplied with photographs of current developments in India.  
   During nine months ending in December 1986, 2000 news-photographs  
   were sent to our Missions abroad. Our Missions in Rangoon, Seoul,  
   Damascus, Mahe, Belgrade, Athens, San Francisco, Lima, Panama,  
   Santiago, and Canberra also held photographic exhibitions during  
   the nine months ending 31 December 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   The XP Division continued to maintain close liaison with the  
   media representatives from abroad, and the resident foreign and  
   Indian media representatives accredited to the Press Information  
   Bureau and rendered them assistance in doing their work. During  
   the 9 months ending 31 December 1986, 31 visiting media  
   representatives participated in the coverage of the Ministerial  
   Meeting of the Co-ordination Bureau of Non-aligned Countries in  
   New Delhi in April 1986, 96 from the participating countries (Sri  
   Lanka 15, Pakistan 28, Bhutan 5, Bangladesh 19, Maldives 6 and  
   Nepal 23) for the SAARC Summit of the Heads of State/Government  
   in Bangalore in November 1986 and about 200 for the visit of  
   General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  
   (CPSU) later that month. In addition, about 300 resident foreign  
   and Indian mediamen participated in these three important events,  
   when the XP Division, with the assistance of other Government  
   Departments, set up Media Centres to give them full facilities,  
   including photo opportunities, supply of transcripts of speeches,  
   timely briefings, interviews with high dignitaries and timely  
   transmission of their despatches. Provision was made for direct  
   telecast of the proceedings of the SAARC Summit at Bangalore for  
   the benefit of the people of the participating countries. 
<br>-87&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   On the invitation of the Government of India, 38 mediamen from  
   different countries paid a visit to India as guests of the XP  
   Division, and another 20 were provided local hospitality or  
   rendered assistance otherwise. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review, the XP Division made complete  
   logistical arrangements, with the help of our Missions abroad,  
   for the media parties which accompanied the Prime Minister of  
   India on his visits to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Tanzania in  
   May; Mauritius in July; London, Mexico and the Eighth Non-aligned  
   Movement (NAM) Summit at Harare in August; and Indonesia,  
   Australia, New Zealand and Thailand in October. Logistical  
   arrangements were also made during the visit of the President of  
   India to Nepal in July 1986, to Yugoslavia, Greece and Poland in  
   October-November; and that of the Vice President of India to  
   Botswana in October. On these occasions, press kits and audio- 
   visual material were sent to our Missions in the countries  
   concerned for a pre-publicity build-up. Similarly, the XP  
   Division made logistical arrangements including Press Conferences  
   for visiting foreign dignitaries and the accompanying media  
   parties. 
<br> 
<br>   The XP Division continued to subscribe to the feature news  
   services of news agencies and commissioned special articles on  
   the occasion of the Republic Day and the Independence Day for  
   dissemination abroad. The publication of special supplements on  
   India by foreign newspapers/journals/magazines were facilitated. 
    
<br><br>With the assistance of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the XP  
Division continued to regularly brief our Missions abroad on the  
   developments in the Punjab and to counter extremist propaganda  
   against India. Our Missions abroad have adopted a multi-pronged  
   approach, including keeping in close touch with the resident  
   Indian communities to brief them regularly about the developments  
   in India including the situation in the Punjab, with a view to  
   isolating the hostile elements. Selected Missions abroad are also  
   being provided with information from the Punjab Government about  
   the developments in the Punjab.

<tr><td>The activities of the Council reached a new high during the  
   year 1986-87. Cultural delegations were sponsored by the Council  
   to tour different regions of the world. During the period under  
   review, the Council also provided an opportunity to Indian  
   audiences to witness some of the leading performing groups from  
   abroad. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council undertook extensive preparations for the Festival  
   of India and other cultural manifestations in the Soviet Union,  
   Sweden and Switzerland scheduled for 1987-88. 
<br> 
<br>   Panels were set up for filling vacancies in respect of  
   Professors and Instructors of Hindi, Sanskrit, Buddhism and  
   classical Music in foreign Universities and in Indian Cultural  
   Centres abroad. 
<br> 
<br>   During the period under review, the Council presented over 62  
   Cultural Programmes, including those presented for the benefit of  
   visiting foreign dignitaries, such as King Hussain of Jordan, and  
   Mr. Demichev, Vice President of the USSR, as well as for major  
   International Conferences. Special programmes were also arranged  
   at Bangalore for the functions hosted by the Prime Minister, the  
   External Affairs Minister and the Foreign Secretary for the Heads  
   of State and Government and other delegates for the SAARC Summit. 
<br>-89&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The Council sponsored the visit of over 33 cultural troupes  
   and separately provided travel assistance to a number of artistes  
   to perform abroad in 1986-87. These included troupes sent out to  
   participate in the Adelaide Festival in Australia, the Cervantes  
   Festival in Mexico, the Seoul Asian Games and the Hydra Arts  
   Festival in Athens. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council arranged over 46 eminent Indians including  
   scholars, academicians, artistes, playwrights, critics and  
   journalists to travel abroad and present different facets of  
   India's culture before international audiences. 
    
<br><br>As the official agency entrusted with the task of implementing  
India's Cultural Exchange Programmes (CEP) with foreign  
   countries, particularly in the field of performing arts, the  
   Council received a large number of performing troupes during the  
   year. These included the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra from the FRG,  
   the Soviet Circus, the Stanislavsky Ballet troupe and the  
   Kransnoyarsk Dance Group from the USSR, the Volos Theatre from  
   Greece, Folk Dance Troupe from Bulgaria, and the Ramayana Ballet  
   from Kampuchea etc. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council received over 50 distinguished personalities  
   including scholars, academicians, writers, poets, painters and  
   sculptors from abroad. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council also organised over 20 exhibitions at home and  
   abroad. Some of the important ones included a photographic  
   exhibition on the life and work of Fujii Guruji from Japan, a  
   Polish Graphics exhibition (April-May 1986), an exhibition of  
   Mexicans Bark Painting (December 1986) and for the first time in  
   India, an exhibition of 60 original graphics of Pablo Picasso  
   from the Museum of Spain. The Council also sponsored the work of  
   artistes abroad, including an exhibition of painting and  
   sculptures by Shri P.T. Reddy (May-June 1986), an exhibition of  
   Contemporary Indian paintings for display in Frankfurt during the  
   Frankfurt Book Fair from 1 to 8 October 1986 and an exhibition of  
   Indian Musical Instruments in China (September 1986). 
   <br>-90&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   The Council awarded 30 scholarships to foreign students under  
its Cultural Scholarship Scheme for 1986-87. It also disbursed  
   scholarships on behalf of other agencies of the Government of  
   India. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council organised a meeting of the Foreign Students  
   Advisors in July 2, 1986 to discuss the problems being faced by  
   the foreign students in India. Thereafter steps have been taken  
   to upgrade and streamline the entire range of facilities  
   available for foreign students. 
<br> 
<br>   During the period under review, the Council organised four  
   study tours for foreign students to places like, Bhopal, Ajanta,  
   Ellora, Bombay, Goa, Alwar, Chittorgarh, Calcutta and the  
   Sunderbans. Receptions were hosted for foreign students on the  
   occasion of the Indian Independence Day, the Republic Day and the  
   Foreign Student's Day at Headquarters and in Regional Offices and  
   in Missions abroad. The Council also organised Orientation  
   Courses for foreign students and for IFS Probationers. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council continued to publish six quarterly journals  
   namely, 'Indian Horizons,' 'Africa Quarterly,' 'Gagnanchal'in  
   Hindi,' Thaqfatual Hind' in Arabic, 'Recontre Avec L'Inde'in  
   French and 'Paples de la India,'in Spanish. However, the Council  
   has shifted from letter press to offset printing of these  
   journals. A special issue of 'Gagnanchal' was brought out in the  
   last quarter of 1986 on Maithilisaran Gupt on the occasion of his  
   birth centenary. In addition to these journals, the Council also  
   undertook the publications of art books, the Azad Memorial  
   Lectures and books in literature and other aspects of Indian  
   Culture. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council collaborated with the Indira Gandhi National  
   Centre for Arts in organizing a seminar on 'Inner &amp; Outer  
   Space'from 18 to 22 November 1986 at New Delhi. The Council also  
   organised during 24 February-5 March 1987 a seminar on 'Tradition  
   : a Continual Renewal' involving over 40 foreign participants. 
<br>-91&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   For promoting a greater awareness and appreciation of the  
   Indian cultural heritage abroad, the Council has established  
   Indian Cultural Centres in Suva (Fiji), Georgetown (Guyana) and  
   Paramaribo (Surinam). A Cultural Window has also been in  
   operation in Bonn (FRG) since 1984. Indian Music, Dance and  
   language are taught by Indian teachers posted by the Council at  
   these Centres. These Centres also maintain libraries and reading  
   rooms and organise lectures, symposia, exhibitions, essay  
   competitions, staging of plays, screening of films, cultural  
   evenings, publications of news bulletins besides developing  
   contacts with a wide cross section of local citizens including  
   students, teachers, intellectuals and cultural personalities. The  
   Council has decided to open new Cultural Centres at Port Louis in  
   Mauritius and at Jakarta in Indonesia during 1987-88. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council deputes Visiting Professors of Indology, Languages  
   and allied subjects in foreign universities. Presently there are  
   visiting Professors of Hindi on deputation to universities in  
   Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, the GDR and Mexico; a visiting  
   Professor of Sanskrit in the university of Mexico; an associate  
   Professor of Tamil in the university of Poland; and visiting  
   Professors of Sociology and Modern Indian History in the  
   universities of the West Indies and Indonesia respectively. The  
   deputation of visiting Professors to Thailand, Turkey, Poland and  
   China is being finalised in consultation with the receiving  
   countries. 
<br> 
<br>   Under the guidelines issued by the Central Cultural Committee  
   of the Government of India in 1971, the Foreign Cultural Centres  
   and Libraries in places other than those in which foreign  
   missions had diplomatic or consular representation, will be  
   managed and supervised by the ICCR. In pursuance of this the  
   management of British Libraries and the House of Soviet Culture  
   at Trivandrum and the supervision of the Max Muller Bhavans and  
   the Alliances Francaise in India have been undertaken by the  
   Council. During the year the ICCR administered the British  
   Libraries located at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Hyderabad,  
   Lucknow, Patna, Pune, Ranchi and Trivandrum and the House of  
   Soviet Culture at Trivandrum. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council functions as the Secretariat for the Indo-US Sub- 
   Commission on Education and Culture. The Joint Media Sub- 
   Committee and the Joint 
<br>-92&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Museum Sub-Committee of the Sub-Commission held their meetings in  
   Bangalore and New Delhi respectively from 5 to 10 January 1987  
   wherein the work programme for 1987-88 was finalised. The Sub- 
   Commission is expected to meet on 16-17 March 1987 at Austin,  
   Texas USA to consider the recommendations of the two Sub- 
   Committees. 
<br> 
<br>   The meetings of the General Assembly of the Council were held  
   in April 1986 and February 1987. The Council set up a  
   Departmental Promotion Committee in February 1987 for the purpose  
   of confirmation/promotion of officials. Recruitment of staff on  
   both regular and contractual basis were done to meet the  
   expanding work of the Council. Computerisation of some of the  
   activities of the Council has also been undertaken. The Council  
   undertook upgraded/renovated facilities such as Auditorium stage,  
   construction of parking lot, construction of electric sub-station  
   for un-interrupted power supply for presentation of cultural  
   programmes, and installation of an electronic telephone exchange  
   etc. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council has decided to set up a Centre for Africa and a  
   Centre for South and South East Asian Cultural Studies within the  
   ICCR. These are expected to commence functioning in April 1987. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council procured and despatched art objects, musical  
   instruments and publications to various Indian Missions on  
   request. It also despatched over 100 sets of musical instruments  
   to Mauritius. The Council also despatched busts of Mahatma Gandhi  
   to San Marino and Madrid, in Spain and a bust of Indira Gandhi to  
   Port Louis, in Mauritius. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council organised the Azad Memorial Lecture on 23 January  
   1987. The lecture was delivered by Dr. Robert Mugabe, Prime  
   Minister of Zimbabwe at a function held in the Teen Murti  
   Auditorium which was attended among others by Prime Minister  
   Rajiv Gandhi. 
<br> 
<br>   The Council provides the Secretariat for the Jawaharlal Nehru  
   Award for International Understanding. The award for 1985 was  
   posthumously conferred 
<br>-93&gt; 
<br> 
<br>on the late Mr. Olaf Palme, Prime Minister of Sweden and was  
   presented at a special ceremony held in New Delhi on 27 January  
   1987. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year under review the Council assisted in the  
   organisation of "Africa Day" on 2 May. The 45th Anniversary of  
   the UN Day was celebrated at the Council's premises on 24  
   October. A special stamp was released on the occasion. The  
   Council organised the "International Solidarity Day with the  
   Palestinian People," on 29 November at Azad Bhavan. The Council  
   also observed the death anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on  
   19 February 1987.

   <tr><td><p align="justify"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="verdana">Persons of Indian origin have settled in many countries all  
   over the world. Indian nationals are also travelling and residing  
   abroad on an increasing scale. The Indians Overseas are  
   increasingly being recognised as a potential bridge of  
   understanding and co-operation. They in turn have evinced greater  
   interest in developing their cultural and economic ties with  
   India to which the Government of India has responded positively  
   with due regard for the mutual benefit of India and of the host  
   country. Therefore, while it is the consistent policy of the  
   Government of India that persons of Indian origin who have taken  
   the nationality of the countries of their domicile should  
   identify themselves with the country of their adoption, the  
   Government of India continues to respond to their need to  
   maintain cultural contacts with India and remains alive to their  
   interest and welfare. The Government of India also takes due  
   responsibility for the protection of the rights and interests of  
   Indian citizens living abroad. 
    
<br><br>The Indian Missions abroad are the first point of contact for  
the Indians Overseas. Our Missions are frequently called upon to  
   respond to queries or demands on a wide range of subjects. The  
   Ministry of External Affairs is trying to play an active role in  
   collecting and disseminating information to our Missions.  
   Building up the database is being done through greater  
   interaction with other Departments/Ministries of the Government.  
   Our Missions have been requested to maintain close contacts with  
   the Indians Overseas and to render effective service to them. The  
   Government of India has set up a Consultative Committee for Non- 
   Resident Indians (NRIs). This Committee comprises of  
   representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Commerce,  
   Industry and External Affairs, the India Investment Centre,  
   representatives of trade and industry and 12 NRIs from different  
   regions of the world who will be represented by rotation. Through  
   this Committee, the NRIs interested in investment and  
   collaboration in India will be in a better position to represent  
   their views to the Government. This Ministry has been actively  
   participating in the meetings of the Committee.

<tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td>As part of its continuing efforts to render better and faster  
   service to the public in Passport Offices, further streamlining  
   of procedures, simplification of formalities and rationalisation  
   of the organisational set-up was undertaken during 1986-87. 
<br> 
<br>   There are now 20 Passport Offices all over India under the  
   administrative control of the Ministry of External Affairs. These  
   offices cover almost all the major States. A statement showing  
   the number of passports/miscellaneous services, applications  
   received and the number of yassports issued/miscellaneous  
   services rendered during the period January to December 1986 is  
   given at Appendix VI. During the calendar year 1986, these  
   offices earned a total revenue of Rs. 9.04 crores towards  
   passport/miscellaneous service fee and incurred an expenditure of  
   Rs. 3.36 crores towards office establishment resulting in a net  
   revenue of Rs. 5.68 crores to the Government. A detailed  
   statement of revenue and expenditure is given at Appendix VII. 
<br> 
<br>   While the Passport Office, Vijaywada (Andhra Pradesh) was  
   closed with effect from 1 May 1986 followed by its merger with  
   the Passport Office, Hyderabad, it has since been decided to  
   close the Passport Office, Jalandhar shortly, followed by its  
   merger with the Regional Passport Office, Chandigarh. It has also  
   been decided by this Ministry to take over passport work from the  
   Goa Administration. The Passport Office at Panaji under the  
   control of this Ministry is likely to start functioning by the  
   beginning of the financial year 1987-88. 
<br> 
<br>   The annual All India Passport Officers' Conference was held at  
   New Delhi from 4 to 6 December 1986 with a view to monitoring the  
   implementation of the 
<br>-98&gt; 
<br> 
  <br> policy and procedural aspects, besides examining the feed back  
   from the Passport Offices towards the practical aspects of the  
implementation of the procedures etc. Other participants in the  
   Conference were representatives from the Ministry of Home  
   Affairs, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Law, the  
   Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Electronics  
   and the India Security Press, Nasik. The Conference was  
   inauguarted by Shri K. Natwar Singh, Minister of State in the  
   Ministry of External Affairs, who gave the guidelines for prompt  
   services in the Passport Offices. Shri N. D. Tiwari, Minister for  
   External Affairs, who addressed the closing session, emphasized  
   the need for the quicker issue of passports, qualitative and  
   courteous service to the general public, besides attending to  
   their grievances. The Minister for External Affairs also  
   impressed upon the need to keep the office premises and its  
   surroundings neat and clean. 
<br> 
<br>   During the year 1986 intensive physical inspections of various  
   Passport Offices was carried out on 21 occasions by the  
   Inspectors from the Ministry as a sequel to which bottlenecks at  
   various stages were spotted and, thereafter, remedial measures  
   taken. Consequently, there has been considerable improvement in  
   quality and in the service to the public, particularly in  
   removing various short-comings existing hitherto in certain  
   Passport Offices. 
<br> 
<br>   Special emphasis has also been laid on the training of the  
   personnel from the Central Passport Organisation in various  
   subjects like Cash &amp; Accounts, Administration, Public Relations,  
   Vigilance matters etc. in the Institute for Secretarial Training  
   Management (ISTIM) New Delhi, besides practical training to some  
   staff members in computer work by making arrangements with the  
   suppliers. 
<br> 
<br>Computerisation in Passport Offices 
<br> 
<br>   In pursuance of the Government's decision to computerise  
   Passport Offices in India in a phased manner, computers have  
   since been installed in the Passport Offices at Delhi and Madras,  
   which have become functional. Computer installation work in  
   Passport Offices at Cochin and Bombay is in progress and  
   computers are likely to be operative at these stations also in  
   the near future. It is proposed to undertake computerisation of  
   another 12 Passport Offices in India during 1987-88. 
<br>-99&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Steps taken to streamline the Procedures for issue of Passports 
<br> 
<br>   With a view to expediting the issue of passports without  
   undermining the security aspects, the categories exempted from  
   the requirements of identity and security verification have been  
   reviewed and further enlarged. 
<br> 
<br>   The policy regarding (a) grant of passport facilities to  
   Indian nationals seeking asylum abroad and (b) issue of duplicate  
   passports in lieu of lost passports has been reviewed and  
   comprehensive guidelines issued to all Indian Missions and Posts  
   abroad to deal with such cases, in a cautious but pragmatic  
   manner. 
<br> 
<br>Complaints and Grievances Cell in Passport Offices 
<br> 
<br>   During the year 1986, approximately 1725 cases of complaints  
   regarding delay in issue of fresh passports or renewal thereof  
   were received against various Passport Offices in India by the  
   Complaints &amp; Grievances Cell of the Ministry of External Affairs.  
   Out of the total, 872 complaints were settled by issuing  
   passports and rendering the services applied for. The reasons for  
   delay were generally either non-receipt or delayed receipt of  
   police/CID reports, besides non-compliance of formalities by the  
   applicants themselves. The applicants are kept informed of the  
   reasons for delay in issuance of passports to the extent  
   possible. 
<br> 
<br>Appeals against refusal of issue of Passports 
<br> 
<br>   55 cases of appeal against the order of impounding or refusal  
   of passport facilities to Indian nationals by the Passport  
   Offices were received. In about 25 cases, Joint Secretary (CPB)  
   and Chief Passport Officer heard the appeals and passed orders  
   allowing or rejecting the requests. Other cases of appeal are in  
   the process of consideration. 
<br>-100&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Miscellaneous Matters 
<br> 
<br>   About 47 cases of forgery of the entries in the passports or  
   visas were reported to the Ministry. Investigations are being  
   made in all these cases of forgeries. 
<br> 
<br>   240 applications were received for issue of certificates of  
   Identity to Stateless persons, most of them being Tibetan  
   refugees. In most cases, Certificates of Identity have been  
   issued to the applicants in consultation with the Territorial  
   Division and the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only a few cases  
   received recently are pending disposal, but are in the process of  
   being disposed of. 
<br> 
<br>Introduction of revised Passport Application Forms 
<br> 
<br>   On the recommendation of the All India Passport Officers'  
   Conference held during 1984, all the passport application forms  
   were revised by a committee to make them computer-compatible. The  
   old application forms were substituted by the revised computer- 
   compatible application forms by the Passport (Second Amendment)  
   Rules, 1985 and were introduced on priced basis in all the  
   Passport Offices in India with effect from 1 September 1986 and  
   in the Indian Missions with effect from the date of receipt of  
   these forms. 
<br> 
<br>Consular Matters 
<br> 
<br>   During 1986, a total of 2711 cases of deportation came to the  
   notice of the Ministry. Of these as many as 2564 were from United  
   Arab Emirates (UAE). In addition, about 352 Indians were  
   evacuated from Aden (PDRY) at Government cost in January 1986 due  
   to the outbreak of Civil War there. Indian Missions/Posts abroad  
   repatriated 227 persons who were in distress in foreign countries  
   besides extending financial assistance, wherever necessary. 
<br> 
<br>   Cases of 172 Indian nationals arrested in various countries  
   (excluding cases in the neighbouring countries), were reported to  
   the Government. All possible Consular assistance was given to  
   them and where possible, their release and return to India were  
   facilitated by the Missions concerned. 
<br>-101&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   782 cases of the death of Indian nationals abroad came to the  
   notice of the Ministry and action was initiated to claim wage  
   dues, death compensation for the heirs of the deceased through  
   respective Indian Missions. 169 cases of the death of foreign  
   nationals in India were also handled. 
<br> 
<br>Consular Attestation of Documents 
<br> 
<br>   1,22,303 documents submitted by the public for production to  
   foreign authorities were attested/authenticated by the Consular  
   section. The procedure for authentication of documents, which was  
   streamlined so as to enable the persons concerned to get back all  
   the documents the same day, was found to be working to the  
   satisfaction of the public. 
<br> 
<br>Consular Convention between India &amp; USSR 
<br> 
<br>   A fresh Consular Convention to regulate consular relations  
   between India and the USSR was signed on 27 November 1986 during  
   General Secretary Gorbachev's visit to India. The previous  
   Consular Convention, which was signed on 29 November 1973 expired  
   on 30 July 1986 but was kept in operation through exchange of  
   Notes verbal between the Government of India and the Government  
   of the USSR. The present convention will enter into force on the  
   30th day after the exchange of instruments of ratification by the  
   two contracting parties. It will remain in force for a period of  
   5 years and will be extendable for another 5 years. 
<br> 
<br>Extradition Treaties with various Countries 
<br> 
<br>   Talks are in progress for entering into an Extradition Treaty  
   with the UK, and an Extradition Treaty and Agreement on Judicial  
   Assistance in criminal matters with the Federal Republic of  
   Germany (FRG). An Extradition Treaty was signed between India and  
   Canada in February 1987. 
<br>-102&gt; 
<br> 
<br>Regional Meetings of Consular Officers 
<br> 
<br>   A Regional Consular Officers meeting was held in London from  
   15 to 17 December 1986. It was attended by Consular Officers from  
   our Missions in France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the FRG and the  
   Netherlands. 
<br> 
<br>   A similar Regional Meeting for the Gulf region was held in  
   Dubai from 20 to 21 December 1986. It was attended by Consular  
   Officers from our Missions in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran and  
   Kuwait. The Head of the Consular, Passport and Visa Division of  
   the Ministry addressed these two regional conferences. The  
   objective of the regional conference is to study the problems  
   facing the Visa and Consular Affairs in rendering smooth,  
   efficient and prompt services to the Indian and Foreign  
   nationals. 
<br> 
<br>   During the period under report several important changes have  
   been brought about in Visa matters. The Visa application form has  
   been simplified considerably with a view to facilitate and  
   attract tourism. The Visa fees in respect of nationals of nearly  
   50 countries have been reviewed and brought at par with the fees  
   being charged by these countries from Indian nationals. Similar  
   exercise in respect of many other countries is under active  
   consideration. The requirement of Visa for travel to India for  
   the Danish diplomatic as well as official passport holders has  
   been dispensed with on reciprocal basis. Like-wise discussions  
   were also held with certain West European countries for obtaining  
   liberal Visa facilities for Indian nationals on reciprocal basis.  
   A joint delegation from the Ministry of External Affairs and the  
   Ministry of Home Affairs at the level of Joint Secretaries  
   visited London and Dubai during December 1986 in order to monitor  
   the functional aspects of Visa sections in both the Indian  
   Missions. The delegation also held talks with the Indian Visa  
   officers in Western Europe and the Gulf countries with a view to  
   improve further the existing arrangements towards issue of Visas  
   to foreigners.

   possible help to the bereaved families. The Unit, after a lapse  
   of almost 8 years, revived the Foreign Office Club which would  
   look after the various social activities of the Ministry as a  
   whole. The Unit observed Flag Day collections on National and Red  
   Cross Days. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministry took care to implement the various Government  
   directives on the welfare of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe  
   employees of this Ministry. A special cell is already functioning  
   to look after the interests of the employees belonging to these  
   communities. A statement showing the total number of employees in  
   this Ministry in various groups and the number of Scheduled  
   Castes and Scheduled Tribes among them is attached as per 
<br>-105&gt; 
<br> 
   <br>Appendix XIII. Another statement showing the number of  
appointments made and vacancies filled by candidates belonging to  
   reserved categories during 1986 is at Appendix XIV. </td></tr>
<tr class="evenRow"><td>  During the year under review, the premises of the erstwhile  
   Akbar Hotel were taken over by the Ministry for accommodating  
   many of its offices. About 1100 employees of the Ministry are now  
   housed in Akbar Bhavan. Consequent to the move, about 130 ex- 
   employees of Akbar Hotel were offered purely temporary employment  
   in the Ministry. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministry continued to pursue its policy of acquiring and  
   constructing properties abroad for the Indian Missions and  
   Personnel. In early 1986, the Ministry's policies regarding  
   acquisition, construction, renovation and maintenance of  
   properties abroad were reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee  
   of the Parliament. As a result, the Ministry's activities in this  
   field have been substantially intensified. 
<br> 
<br>   The 30-year dispute with the Government of the People's  
   Republic of China regarding the properties of the Indian Embassy  
   in Beijing was resolved and the present premises of the Chancery  
   and the Ambassador's residence were acquired on a long lease in  
   addition to the acquisition of a plot of land in Beijing for the  
   purpose of additional construction for the Embassy. Chanceries  
   were purchased in Lisbon and Madrid and residences were purchased  
   for officers and staff in Tunis, West Berlin, Sydney, Canberra  
   and Paris. 
<br> 
<br>   The renovation of the High Commissioner's residence in  
   Canberra was completed while that of High Commissioner's  
   residence at Wellington was in the final stages. By the end of  
   the year under review various obstacles facing the construction  
   projects at Islamabad and Colombo were successfully cleared and  
   the progress of work on these projects became satisfactory. The  
   construction of the Chancery at Nicosia and staff residences at  
   Nairobi were nearing completion. Of all new projects of  
   construction of Chanceries and/or residences abroad in various  
   countries assigned to the Indian architects, the projects at  
   Kuwait and Riyadh were approved and the planning of these  
   projects was proceeding satisfactorily. 
<br>-106&gt; 
<br> 
<br>   Since its inception in June 1982, the Conference Cell of the  
   Ministry of External Affairs has been providing logistical  
   support for various International Conferences held in India. As  
   in the past, during the year under review, arrangements were made  
   for various Conferences/delegations. A list of such conferences  
   is given at Appendix XV. Facilities provided included assistance  
   in arranging the venue of the meetings, simultaneous translation  
   and documentation in principal foreign languages, and general  
   guidance in various formalities associated with the holding of  
   important Conferences. Arrangements were also made for the  
   reception/seeing off of important delegates attending  
   international Conferences in India. All these measures have  
   brought down considerably the expenditure involved in organising  
   Conferences by various departments of the Government. 
<br> 
<br>   A special mention needs to be made of two important  
   Conferences arranged by the Conference Cell during 1986, namely,  
   the Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of the Non-aligned  
   Countries attended by the Foreign Ministers from all Non-aligned  
   Countries and the Summit Meeting of the South Asian Association  
   for Regional Co-operation. The latter Conference was held at  
   Bangalore. In spite of several limitations, arrangements made by  
   the Conference Cell were found to be most satisfactory.

<tr><td> The Foreign Service Training Institute (FSTI) was established  
to cater to the specific professional training needs of the  
Ministry viz., induction and refresher training for all  
categories of officials. It is located at Akbar Bhavan, Satya  
Marg, New Delhi. Its programmes are designed with reference to  
the guidelines on civil service training issued by the Department  
of Personnel and Training, Ministry of Personnel etc., and the  
specific conditions and requirements of the foreign service. 
 
  <br>
<br> The FSTI registered significant progress in training  
activities during the period under review. The training of new  
recruits to the IFS(A) was streamlined in the form of a  
comprehensive and integrated "Professional Course in Diplomacy &amp;  
International Relations" which the new recruits (effective from  
1985 batch) are now required to undergo at the FSTI after the  
Foundational Course at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy,  
Mussoorie. The duration of the course is approximately five  
months. The topics covered include : India's Foreign Policy &amp;  
External Relations; India's National Security; India's Foreign  
Trade; International Law; Diplomatic Practice; Behavioural Skills  
and handling of political, commercial, consular, administrative,  
cultural and external publicity work. Although this Course is  
targeted primarily at the IFS(A) new recruits, relevant segments  
of it are also open to any other interested potential  
beneficiaries including foreign service wives. 
 
  <br>
<br> The highlights of the period were three Refresher Courses of 5  
to 8 days' duration organised for Indian Ambassadors/High  
Commissioners which were attended by 58 Heads of Missions and  
many senior officers from headquarters. 
 
   <br>
<br>Altogether 122 officers/staff etc. availed of the training  
programmes organised by the Institute during the year under  
review. A similar cycle of programmes is planned for 1987. </td></tr>

<tr class="evenRow"><td>During the year, the Ministry continued with its efforts for  
   more use of Hindi in official work, both at Headquarters and in  
   Missions abroad and monitored the progress in this regard. 
<br> 
<br>   Since 1986, a Hindi Advisory Committee is functioning in the  
   Ministry under the Chairmanship of the External Affairs Minister.  
   During the year under review, the Committee met three times and  
   besides reviewing the use of Hindi in the Ministry, gave  
   suggestions for its greater utilisation in official work. In  
   addition, an Official Language Implementation Committee of the  
   Ministry also met three times during 1986. 
<br> 
<br>   In pursuance of the target fixed in the annual programme  
   issued by the Department of Official Language, the Ministry  
   inspected its Passport Offices at Lucknow, Bareilley, Guwahati,  
   Calcutta, Bhubaneshwar and Hyderabad with a view to assessing the  
   progress in the use of Hindi in these offices. Necessary  
   instructions were issued to the concerned offices for compliance  
   with Government orders regarding the Official Language. 
<br> 
<br>   In addition, the Committee of Parliament on Official Language  
   inspected the Passport Offices at Hyderabad and Cochin. The  
   Committee also visited this Ministry on 22 January 1987 and the  
   Passport Offices at Delhi and Ahmedabad on 2 and 3 February for  
   assessing the progress in the use of Hindi. 
<br> 
<br>   During 1986, Hindi Workshops were conducted in the Ministry in  
   which a number of officials participated. A 'Hindi-Week' was  
   organised in the month 
<br>-109&gt; 
<br> 
<br>of September 1986, during which a Hindi Essay Competition and a  
   Hindi Typing Competition were organised and awards were  
   distributed to the winners. 
<br> 
<br>   The Ministry also made efforts to propagate Hindi abroad. A  
   number of Hindi standard books were sent to various Missions  
   abroad on Indian Literature, Culture and Religion, for building  
   standard Hindi Libraries in them. In addition, teaching materials  
   and typewriters were sent as requested. 
<br> 
<br>   As in the previous years, OSD (Hindi) of the Ministry was sent  
   to PMI, New York to assist the Indian delegation to the UN, in  
   case any member chose to speak in Hindi. OSD (Hindi) was also  
   sent to Port-of-Spain, Georgetown and Paramaribo to assess the  
   position of Hindi in these countries.
