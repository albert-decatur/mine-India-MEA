       INTRODUCTION 
      <br><br>The continuity and consistency of purpose that characterises 
      Indian Foreign       Policy was once again confirmed during this the 
      Fortieth Anniversary Year    of Independence. India continued to strive 
      for global peace, disarmament and    development through nonalignment and 
      friendship with all countries, particularl    y    neighbours. The 
      enlargement of human freedom, unflinching opposition to    racialism and 
      colonialism and the creation of equitable conditions conducive    to the 
      peaceful and harmonious development of nations continued to guide its 
         conduct. <br><br>In the crusade for nuclear and general disarmament, 
      India along with    the other five nations of the Six nation Initiative 
      welcomed the INF Treaty bet    -    ween the Soviet Union and USA as a 
      historic first step. Their Declaration in St    o-    ckholm on 22 
      January appreciated resumption of the dialogue and called for 
         verification and compliance with agreements in this field. The 
      Declaration call    ed    for immediate suspension of all nuclear 
      testing pending a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. While congratulating 
      General Secretary Gorbachev and President    Reagan, the Prime Minister, 
      Shri Rajiv Gandhi stressed that the goal must still       remain the 
      destruction of all nuclear arsenals as a prelude to general and 
         complete disarmament. Throughout the year India continued to play a 
      prominent       role in the UN in furthering this cause. Importance was 
      given to the prohibitio    n    of chemical weapons and a number of 
      resolutions sponsored by India on nuclear       disarmament were adopted 
      by large majorities. Our concern was also registered    against the 
      militarisation of outer space.<br><br> Minister of State Shri K. Natwar Sin    gh 
         was elected President of the, General Conference on Disarmament and 
      Develop- ment under the aegis of the UN held in New York in 
      August/September 1987. The Final Document constituted a step towards 
      turning swords into ploughshares. <br><br>India sought, through 
      international fora and through concerted action    by like-minded 
      countries, to end the anachronistic system of apartheid. At the 
            Vancouver meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, India 
      played a major role in rallying opinion in favour of the continuation of 
      mandatory    sanctions against racist South Africa. India is a member of 
      the Eight-member    Committee of Foreign Ministers formed at the 
      Vancouver Summit to monitor    the implementation of a programme of 
      action on Southern Africa concerned       (iii)       (iv) 
            with sanctions against South Africa, the rendering of assistance 
      by the inte    rnational community to the Frontline States and other 
      issues.<br> <br>As Chairman of the Africa Fund, India was pleased to announce 
      that commitments had already reached a quarter billion US dollars 
      within the year and projects are being    identified to help the 
      Frontline States withstand the political and economic    onslaught of the 
      Pretoria regime. <br><br>Nearer home, the degree of cooperation among the 
      countries of South    Asia in agreed areas has grown. India handed over 
      the Chairmanship of    SAARC to Nepal at the Third SAARC Summit in 
      Kathmandu in November.    Of the nearly 100 activities organised by 
      SAARC, India hosted 45. The Third    Summit meeting took important 
      decisions which will have a bearing on the    future course of SAARC. A 
      Regional Convention was signed on the Suppres-    sion of Terrorism which 
      is awaiting ratification. An agreement establishing a       Food 
      Security Reserve was reached which would enable member states to draw 
         on food stocks in an emergency. Other important decisions were, to 
      commission       a study on environment, to promote means of enhancing 
      people-to-people con-    tacts in SAARC countries and to undertake 
      studies on various aspects of plan-ning.<br><br> It was agreed to establish a 
      meteorological centre and an agricultural information centre in India 
      and Bangladesh respectively. India announced a contribution of Rs. 
      17.5 million for SAARC activities for 1988-89. <br><br>The Agreement to 
      establish peace and normalcy in Sri Lanka signed in    Colombo on 29th 
      July 1987, provided a framework for satisfying the legitimate 
            aspirations of the Sri Lankan Tamils within a united Sri Lanka. 
      The hope of    durable peace and stability in Sri Lanka now rests upon 
      the full implementation of this historic accord. One of the Tamil groups, 
      LTTE has, however, still    been unwilling to make the transition from 
      militancy and restore the democratic       process. By resorting to 
      large-scale killings, the LTTE attempted to prevent th    e    return of 
      normalcy and mounted attacks on the Indian Peace Keeping Force 
         deployed in terms of the Agreement to supervise the cease-fire and 
      ensure the       safety and security of all communities in the North and 
      East. This compelled    the IPKF to start operations in early October to 
      disarm the LTTE. <br><br>The IPKF established effective control of Jaffna 
      by the end of that month. Simultaneousl    y    a major effort was 
      mounted to provide relief to and rehabilitate those affected       by 
      the fighting. Similar measures have been taken in other parts of the 
      Norther    n    and Eastern provinces. The restoration of peace and 
      normalcy in Sri Lanka    through the full and faithful implementation of 
      the Agreement remains a cardina    l    objective of the Government of 
      India. <br><br>India continued its quest for better relations with 
      Pakistan.There was a    meeting between the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv 
      Gandhi, and President Zia in New <br><br>(v)Delhi in February 
      1987, and between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakist    an in 
         Kathmandu in November. Talks were held at Secretary level on matters 
      pertain-       ing to maintaining tranquillity of the Indo-Pakistan 
      border, preventing traffic    king    in drugs and promoting economic 
      cooperation and trade. Inspite of India's    genuine efforts to improve 
      ties, Pakistan's response left much to be desired.<br><br> The 
      encouragement given by it to the Punjab terrorists, the use of its 
      nuclear faci    lity    for weapons production, its overarming with 
      highly sophisticated weapons in-    cluding AWACS, unwarranted statements 
      on Kashmir, and offensive military    actions in the Siachen area are 
      some of the more glaring examples of this nega-       tive attitude, 
      which cannot but jeopardise the process of normalisation outline    d 
         during President Zia's visit to Delhi on Dec 17, 1985. India sought to 
      strengthen bilateral relations with Bangladesh. One    significant step 
      was the visit of Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, Minister for Human 
            Resource Development to Bangladesh as the Special Emissary of the 
      Prime    Minister of India in August. The problem of the Chakma refugees 
      in India was    raised but no agreement has been reached regarding their 
      repatriation to    Bangladesh. <br><br>The traditional ties of friendship 
      and cooperation between India and    Nepal were nourished through 
      increasing contacts at various levels. A highlight    was the Prime 
      Minister's visit to Nepal in November for the SAARC Summit.<br> <br>There were 
      also several exchange of visits at Ministerial and official levels. 
         India continued to render assistance to Nepal in its socioeconomic 
      development.    <br><br>The meeting between the Prime Minister of India 
      and His Majesty the    King of Bhutan during the SAARC meeting in 
      Kathmandu provided an oppor-    tunity to further foster the close ties 
      existing between the two countries. Ind    ia continued to help Bhutan in 
      the industrial, economic, technical and educational       fields. 
            India announced a relief assistance of Rs. 20 lakhs to the 
      Government    of the Maldives to recover the loss, and to repair the 
      damage, particularly to       the international airport at Male, caused 
      by a tidal wave. Discussions were als    o    held on ways to expand 
      trade and industrial collaboration. <br><br>The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv 
      Gandhi and Shrimati Sonia Gandhi paid a    visit to Burma in December at 
      the invitation of the Burmese Prime Minister.    The meeting between the 
      Prime Minister and the Burmese leaders on matters of    mutual interest 
      and benefit were marked by cordiality and is expected to raise 
            <br><br>(vi) substantially the level of cooperation. During the 
      visit of the Burmese Fore    ign    Minister to India in September, 
      Instruments of Ratification of-the Maritime    Boundary Agreement of 1986 
      were exchanged. <br><br>India has naturally taken active interest in 
      developments with regard to Afghanistan. The Soviet offer of withdrawal of 
      troops from Afghanistan    within a limited time-frame and the steps 
      taken by the People's Democratic    Party of Afghanistan to seek national 
      reconciliation have brought about a quali    -    tative change. in the 
      situation. India maintained contacts with the various Afg    han 
         elements, including those opposed to the Government, with a view to 
      promoting       the objective of a peaceful, nonaligned and independent 
      Afghanistan, free from    external interference or intervention. 
      <br><br>Hopes of a negotiated settlement of the eight-year old Iran-Iraq 
      war follow    -    ing the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 598 
      have not been realised.       India's relations with Iran and Iraq, 
      however, remain warm and cordial despite       the continuing conflict. 
      The Speaker of the Lok Sabha led a Parliamentary    delegation to both 
      countries in October and there were significant economic    and 
      commercial exchanges with each. India's good offices continue to be 
      avail-able to both the antagonists to bring about a negotiated settlement. 
      However,       the escalation of foreign naval presences in the Gulf has 
      further exacerbated a    n    already dangerous situation. India has 
      consistently opposed the increase of    naval presences of outside powers 
      in the Indian Ocean area and was disappointed       over the 
      postponement of the proposed UN International Conference on the Indian 
      Ocean till 1990.<br><br>As pointed out by the Minister of State, Shri K. Natwar 
      Singh, during the forty-second Session of the UN General Assembly, 
      the    heightened military presence of outside powers in the Indian Ocean 
      is in confli    ct    with the UN Declaration in 1971 on making the 
      Indian Ocean a Zone of Peace.       India's traditionally close 
      relations with the Arab countries continued    to grow on a basis of 
      mutual interest. Support for the UN proposed Inter-    national 
      Conference on the Middle East confirmed India's commitment to the 
         Palestinian cause. The visit of Chairman Arafat to India and India's 
      participa-       tion in the Algiers Session of the Palestine National 
      Council reflected the conti-    nuing close relations between India and 
      the PLO. There were meaningful ex-    changes with Jordan, Syria and 
      Egypt. India maintained very good relations with       the countries of 
      the Maghreb region and, at the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of Alg    e- 
         rian Independence in July, was represented by a high-level delegation. 
      With the       opening of the Embassy of the Saharawi Arab Democratic 
      Republic (SADR)    in Delhi, India's Ambassador to Algeria was 
      concurrently accredited to the    SADR. With Libya and Tunisia, 
      possibilities of further cooperation in the industrial and economic fields 
      were explored, More Indian doctors, engineers and    (vii)       other 
      personnel were recruited by Libya. Trade and the presence of large 
         numbers of Indian workers constituted the main links between India and 
      the    six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It Was a measure of 
      the value of       Indian Labour that, inspite of recessionary 
      tendencies in the Gulf, India was a    ble    to maintain her share in 
      the Gulf labour market. There has also been a growing desire of these 
      countries to invest in India. <br><br>Relations with African countries 
      continued to grow apace during the    year. The visits of the Angolan 
      President, the Foreign Ministers of Uganda and       of Ethiopia, the 
      Mauritian Minister of Health, the Nigerian Minister of Agri- 
            culture and Industries, and the Education Minister of Scychelles 
      all served to       enhance these ties. The then Minister for External 
      Affairs, Shri N. D. Tiwari,       and the Minister for Human Resource 
      Development Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao, visited Mauritius on the occasion of 
      the Presidential inauguration. India, alon    g    with the other member 
      states of the AFRICA Fund, sought to create an awareness       about the 
      Fund and solicited active support for it. A special presentation on 
            AFRICA Fund was made at the meeting of the Association of West 
      European    Parliamentarians for Action against Apartheid at Strasbourgh 
      in May.<br><br> Indian Parliamentarians had visited a number of countries in 
      this connection. A Special Envoy of the Prime Minister of India 
      visited some countries to mobilise    resources for the Africa Fund. At a 
      meeting of senior officials of the Fund Com    -    mittee held in Delhi 
      in August, a number of donors and UN agencies were    present. 
            India's cordial relations with the countries of South East Asia 
      and the    Pacific area also continued to grow and was characterised by 
      the exchange of    useful visits. Indian Ministers visited Brunei, 
      Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore       and the Philippines. Within the 
      framework of good political relations, important    discussions were held 
      in the field of business and economic cooperation. A    Memorandum of 
      Understanding between the Federation of Chambers of Com-    merce and 
      Industries of Singapore and the Federation of the Indian Chambers    of 
      Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and an agreement on the Avoidance of 
         Double Taxation with Indonesia, were some of the highlights of India's 
      econo-       mic cooperation with the ASEAN Grouping. Indian trade 
      exhibitions were held    in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.<br><br> So far as the 
      three Indo-China states were concerned, efforts were directed towards 
      finding a negotiated political settlement in Kampuchea with the 
      cooperation of all the opposing parties. The main thrust in this direction 
            was to reduce the gap in the perceptions between the ASEAN and the 
      Indo-    China states and to foster a dialogue between the Kampuchean 
      factions. A    significant breakthrough in the impasse was the opening of 
      the dialogue between       344 EA/88--2 </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>

            Prince Sihanouk and Prime Minister Hun Sen of Kampuchea. The visit 
      of the       Minister of State Shri K. Natwar Singh, to the ASEAN 
      countries in April 1987,       and to Indo-China in June-July 1987, 
      helped pave the way for a serious    attempt at a negotiated settlement. 
            India's cooperation with the two important countries of the South 
         Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, continued to grow, especially in 
      the    wake of the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to these 
      countries in Oct    ober 1986. With Australia, there was a Joint Business 
      Council meeting in March       1987, a senior officials' meeting in 
      April and a visit by the Secretary in the       Australian Ministry of 
      Foreign Affairs and Trade, in September. A Memoran-    dum of 
      Understanding on Space Research was signed. The Joint Trade Com- 
      mittee between India and New Zealand had its first meeting in New 
      Delhi in June.<br><br>The President of Vanuatu, Ati George Sokomanu, paid 
      a goodwill visit    in December which served to strengthen the already 
      friendly ties with this non-       aligned country in the South Pacific. 
            India's traditional relations with Fiji, a country in the South 
      Pacific    with a large number of ethnic Indians, suffered a set-back 
      following the milita    ry    coup there in May 1987. India was 
      constrained to express its deep concern    over the overthrow of a 
      democratically elected Government and to condemn    racial discrimination 
      against ethnic Indians by the military regime. Besides, I    ndia    has 
      taken the position that any future viable constitutional arrangement in 
      Fij    i    should be equitable and acceptable to all communities. 
            As in the past, India conveyed to the Chinese Government its 
      desire to    renew and revitalise its relations with the People's 
      Republic of China.<br><br> The transit visits of Shri K. C. Pant, the then 
      Minister for Steel and Mines to Beijing in April 1987, and that of 
      Shri N. D. Tiwari, the then Minister for    External Affairs in May, 
      helped create a better atmosphere to carry forward    the process of 
      dialogue especially on the Sino-Indian boundary issue. it was    against 
      this background that the Eighth Round of official-level Sino-Indian tal 
         ks    were held in New Delhi in November 1987. The talks were serious 
      and positive. <br><br>Both sides felt that the border problem which had 
      bedevilled mutual relations       had to be sorted out with patience. 
      During the year, there were important ex-       changes between India 
      and China in the fields of culture, science and technolo-       gy. A 
      Sino-Indian trade protocol which was signed covering the period    1 
      January 1987 to 31 March 1988, envisages a trade exchange of US    $ 150 
      to 200 million,    <br>(ix)    With Japan, there was an upswing in 
      relations in the economic, com-    mercial, scientific and cultural 
      fields. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi    tran-    sited through 
      Tokyo in October 1987. The transit visit of the then Minister for 
            External Affairs, Shri N. D. Tiwari to Japan and the visits of the 
      Japanese For    eign    Minister, Mr. Kuranari, and of Prince Hiro, the 
      son of the Crown Prince during    1987, helped bring the two countries 
      closer. There were increased contacts and       exchanges at the level 
      of businessmen between the two countries.<br><br> Japan ranked as India's 
      third largest trading partner and the highest donor of Official 
         Development Assistance (ODA). In the cultural field a Japan Month was 
      held    in the metropolitan cities of India-an exposition of Japan's 
      cultural life. A       Festival of India is scheduled to be held in 
      Japan from April 1988. <br><br>Enhanced economic cooperation provided the 
      underpinning to India's improving relations with the Republic of 
      Korea. The then Minister for External       Affairs, Shri N. D. Tiwari, 
      paid an official visit when, besides his counterpar    t,    he called 
      on the President and the Prime Minister. There were significant ex- 
            changes in the economic, scientific and cultural fields between 
      the two countri es. <br><br>India-Republic of Korea trade talks and a 
      meeting of the Economic Cooperation    Committee were held in New Delhi. 
            With the DPRK, the momentum of political exchanges was sustained. 
         Shri K. C. Pant, the then Minister for Steel and Mines, led a 
      delegation to the       DPRK, as Special Envoy of the Prime Minister to 
      attend the Seventy-fifth Birth-       day celebrations of President Kim 
      Il Sung. This delegation included Shri Eduard    o    Faleiro, the then 
      Minister of State for External Affairs, and Members of Parlia    ment. 
      The DPRK Vice-President had, in February 1987, visited India for consul- 
            tations for the Extraordinary Ministerial Conference of 
      Non-aligned Countries. <br><br>India participated in the film festival of 
      Non-aligned countries held in Pyongy    ang    in October 1987. The 
      Prime Minister of DPRK paid an official visit to India    in February 
      1988.       With Mongolia, the main highlight of relations was the 
      visits of the    Governor of West Bengal, Prof. Nurul Hasan, and of a 
      Mongolian Parliamentary    delegation to each other's countries. A 
      cultural exchange programme for    1987--89 was signed. <br><br>India's 
      relations with Western Europe at the level of the European    Community 
      and at the bilateral level with individual countries continued on an 
            even keel. On the political plane, there was a broad similarity of 
      views on the       need to reach negotiated settlement of international 
      problems. The EEC being    the largest trading bloc in the world, India 
      continued to pursue vigorously her      <br>(x) cooperation with the 
      Community. The European Community is already a signi-    ficant 
      trading partner of India. However, India has been having a deficit in th 
         e    balance of trade with Western Europe and steps have been 
      initiated to rectify       the imbalance.<br><br>India had made 
      demarches to Western European countries regarding anti-Indian 
      activities being carried out from their soil and the response from <br>(x) 
            cooperation with the Community. The European Community is already 
      a signi-       ficant trading partner of India. However, India has been 
      having a deficit in th    e    balance of trade with Western Europe and 
      steps have been initiated to rectify       the imbalance.       India 
      had made demarches to Western European countries regarding    anti-Indian 
      activities being carried out from their soil and the response from 
         meetings of India's Joint Commissions with many of the East European 
      countries       were held, the decisions of which gave a yet greater 
      content to India's relatio    ns    with these countries. 
      <br><br>Indo-Yugoslav relations continued to be warm and cordial. There 
      was    close cooperation relating to developments in the nonaligned 
      world. Efforts are       on to increase technology transfer between the 
      two countries and for industrial    cooperation in third countries. 
            The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi paid a working visit to 
      Washington    in October, after the Vancouver Summit. He had wide-ranging 
      discussions with    President Reagan, senior US officials and important 
      members of the US Cong-    ress. Areas of future bilateral cooperation 
      were identified which covered a wid    e    spectrum of fields and 
      activities. The Minister of State, Shri K.<br><br> Natwar Singh, had 
      visited the USA in April 1987. The US decision to sell a supercomputer 
         to India was a measure of the confidence that had been built up 
      between the    two countries. However, the US decision to waive its 
      non-proliferation laws    in favour of Pakistan despite the evidence of 
      that country's clandestine weapon    s-    oriented nuclear programme 
      was a cause for grave concern. This has made    more ominous the scale 
      and sophistication of US military assistance to Pakistan    . 
      <br><br>Indo-Canadian relations maintained a steady pace during the period 
         under review. There were significant exchange of visits between the 
      two mem-    bers of the Commonwealth. The two Prime Ministers met during 
      the Vancouver    Summit in October. Issues of bilateral and international 
      significance were dis-       cussed. The Extradition Treaty signed by 
      the two countries in February 1987,    in New Delhi, will have a salutary 
      effect in combating extremism and terrorism       aimed against India. 
      <br>(xii)       As in the past, India's relations with the countries of 
      Latin America    and the Caribbean were marked by warmth and cordiality. 
      There were exchange    of visits and the signing of bilateral agreements. 
      From India, Shri N. D. Tiwar    i,    the then Minister for External 
      Affairs, visited Trinidad and Tobago in March    1987. The then Minister 
      of State for External Affairs, Shri Eduardo Faleiro, pa    id    an 
      official visit to Cuba and met President Castro, the Vice-President and 
      the       Foreign Minister. From Latin America, the Uruguayan Foreign 
      Minister and a    Colombian Parliamentary delegation were among the more 
      important visitors. <br><br>India continued her support to the peace 
      initiative of the Contadora    Group and in all international fora 
      reiterated the call for a peaceful resoluti    </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td>

       on <br>of the 
      crisis in Central America through dialogue and without outside inter- 
         ference. The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi congratulated Mr. Arias 
      Sanchez,       the President of Costa Rica, on being awarded the Nobel 
      Peace Prize for his    contribution to the Central American Peace 
      efforts. <br><br>India sustained her efforts to create consensus within 
      the Non-Aligned    Movement on major international issues and worked 
      closely, with the other    nonaligned countries. She also emphasised the 
      need for the Movement to play    an increasingly active role on global 
      economic issues,particularly those con-       cerning the developing 
      countries. She participated in the Extraordinary Ministe    rial 
         Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-aligned Countries on 
      Latin,    America and the Caribbean in Georgetown in Match 1987 and the 
      Ministerial    Meeting of the NAM Committee of Nine on Palestine at 
      Harare in April 1987,    both at the level of the Minister for External 
      Affairs. India expressed her sol    i-    darity with and support for 
      the Contadora process by participating in a delega-tion of the NAM 
      Committee on Central America, to Managua and Caracas in    August. 
      <br><br>India continued to play a significant role in fostering greater 
      coopera-    tion among the less developed countries themselves and in 
      presenting common    positions on international economic issues in the UN 
      and other organisations.       She was an active participant in the 
      Extraordinary Ministerial Conference on    South-South Cooperation in 
      Pyongyang in June. This meeting reviewed the    implementation of the 
      existing programmes and ways to further such coopera-tion. At the 
      forty-second Session of the UN General Assembly, the developing 
         nonaligned countries took a common stand on important issues like 
      external    debt. While consensus of the General Assembly on this issue 
      could not be    achieved it was possible to secure consensus on the 
      important issue of Environ-       ment which was facilitated by the 
      efforts of the Indian delegation. <br>(xiii)       In a climate in which 
      the major developed countries paid less heed to serious international 
      negotiations in the UN on international economic problems    , 
         particularly on an issue like debt relief, India's main effort was to 
      sustain t    he    fundamental positions already achieved while working 
      for progress in new areas. <br><br>As in the past, India actively 
      supported all initiatives for enhancing cooperat    ion    among the 
      developing countries and participated in the Sixth Ministerial Meet- 
            ing of the Group of 77 in Havana in April 1987. The financial 
      crisis facing the UN engaged India's serious attention.    India, along 
      with other nonaligned countries played an active role in getting a 
            resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly which requested the 
      President    of the General Assembly to keep under consideration the 
      possibility of recon-       vening the forty-second Session of the 
      Assembly in 1988 to discuss the financia    l    situation facing the 
      UN. <br><br>An appreciation of India's active and positive role in the UN 
      was    reflected in her election to several UN bodies and international 
      organisations.       Among the more important ones were the Economic and 
      Social Council, the    Committee for Progress and Coordination, the 
      Commission on Human Settle-    ments and the Executive Board of UNICEF. 
            India's commitment to foster cooperation among the developing 
         countries was reflected, inter alia, in the enhanced bilateral 
      exchange program    -    mes with the developing countries of Asia, 
      Africa and Latin America, under the Indian Technical and Economic 
      Cooperation programme (ITEC). The monetary    value of this assistance 
      now stands at over Rs. 12 crores, starting from a mode    st    outlay 
      of Rs. 4.61 crores in 1964. India's economic and technical assistance, 
            for instance, to the Indo-China states was channelled through 
      ITEC. In    Afghanistan, the ITEC programme covered fields such as public 
      health, small-    scale industry and education.    with the Overseas 
      Indians and extended assistance to them in consultation    with the host 
      country, in overcoming some of their problems. Facilities for Non    - 
         Resident Indians (NRIs) to invest in India were widely disseminated by 
      Indian       Missions abroad. The Ministry of External Affairs also 
      joined in sponsoring a       Seminar to deal with the particular 
      problems of NRIs in the Gulf Region at    which a number of their 
      suggestions have been brought to the notice of con-    cerned Union and 
      State Government Departments for implementation.<br> (xiv)    The 
      External Publicity Division of the Ministry stepped up its projection 
         of information on India; various aspects of the country's foreign 
      policy and th    e    significant advances made in the fields of Indian 
      agriculture, industry and sci    ence    and technology. A particular 
      form was provided by the continuing celebrations       of the Fortieth 
      Anniversary of India's Independence. The Division also sought to project 
      the correct situation in sensitive areas like the Punjab and Sri Lan 
         ka.    This was done through regular briefings of representatives of 
      Indian and foreig    n    press and television media and the despatch of 
      literature through Indian Missio    ns    abroad. Several foreign and 
      Indian mediamen were taken to Jaffna to witness    the relief supplies 
      given by India to Sri Lanka. This was repeated later to wit    -    ness 
      the surrender of arms by militant Tamil organisations. <br><br>Indian 
      Missions abroad engaged actively in the Fortieth Anniversary 
         celebrations during the year in close cooperation with the Indian 
      communities       and friendship societies and with the encouragement of 
      host Governments.    There has been a positive response worldwide both in 
      respect of these celebra-       tions and in preparation for marking the 
      Jawaharlal Nehru Centenary in    1988-89.    Dec 17, 1985

       During the year 1997-88 India sought to 
      further develop relations of friend-       ship, cooperation and mutual 
      understanding with its neighbours in South Asia.          A major step 
      in this direction was the India-Sri Lanka Agreement signed    by the 
      Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi and President Jayewardene in Colombo 
            on Jul 29, 1987. Although the Agreement has far-reaching benefits 
      for all the       parties involved, the LTTE proved unwilling to make 
      the transition from mili-       tancy to democratic means and set out to 
      try and wreck the Agreement. This left       the Indian Peace Keeping 
      Force with no choice but to move against the LTTE    to disarm them. But 
      the Agreement has already resulted in substantial gains. Th    e 
         Provincial Councils Act and the necessary constitutional amendments 
      have been       passed to create the Provincial Councils and devolve 
      substantial powers to them <br><br>. Over 3000 Tamil detenus have been 
      released and nearly 10,000 Sri Lankan    refugees have returned to Sri 
      Lanka from India. Efforts are now underway to    organise Provincial 
      Council elections so that the aspirations of the Tamils can       find 
      democratic expression.       The Agreement thus meets the concerns of 
      all the parties. It preserves    Sri Lanka's unity and integrity; 
      recognises the historical habitation of the Ta    mils    of Sri Lanka; 
      provides for Tamil also as an official language of that island an    d 
         secures for the Tamils, equal citizenship of that country. It 
      safeguards India'    s    strategic interests. It is an example of how 
      two Non-aligned countries can solv    e    major and complex problems 
      bilaterally, without the involvement of outside    Powers. <br><br>The 
      Government of India continued its efforts to maintain regular contact 
         with the Bangladesh Government and to strengthen friendly relations 
      with Bangla    -    desh. The Minister for Human Resource Development, 
      Shri P. V. Narasimha    Rao visited Dhaka on 17 August 1987 as the Prime 
      Minister's Special Emissary    and held extensive discussions with 
      President Ershad on matters of mutual inter    est.<br><br>    344 EA/88--3 
      PG1<br><br>PG2<br>During this visit, the importance of 
      Bangladesh taking urgent action to take    back    the more than 49,000 
      Chakma refugees who had entered India from Bangladesh    after April 1986 
      was stressed. Unfortunately, despite the matter having been    raised 
      with Bangladesh repeatedly, the problem continues unresolved and the 
         refugees are still in India unwilling to return without credible 
      guarantees fro    m the    Bangladesh Government about their safety. On 
      the question of the sharing of    common river waters, the term of the 
      Joint Committee of Experts engaged in    studying the subject was 
      extended twice, first in May 1987 and then again in    November 1987. 
      <br><br>India and Nepal continued to nurture their traditional and 
      friendly rela-    tions. The Prime Minister visited Kathmandu in November 
      1987 for the    SAARC Summit and had wide-ranging and fruitful 
      discussions with His Majesty    the King of Nepal. The King expressed 
      great satisfaction at the growing under-       standing between Nepal 
      and India. While transiting through Delhi, Prince    Gyanendra called on 
      the Prime Minister in May 1987. After the External Affairs Minister's 
      visit to Kathmandu in January 1987    and the Nepalese Foreign Minister's 
      visit to Delhi in June 1987 the tradition o    f    frequent political 
      consultations was further consolidated with the Nepalese    Foreign 
      Minister transiting through Delhi twice in December 1987, in the course 
            of which, he called on the Prime Minister and had substantive 
      discussions with    the Minister of State for External Affairs. The 
      Nepalese Minister reiterated    appreciation for India's crucial 
      assistance in Nepal's overall socioeconomic    development, and Nepal's 
      commitment to further our multifaceted relationship.    <br><br>A fresh 
      fillip to the promotion of people-to-people relations and cooperatio    n 
         among parliamentarians was given by the visit of an Indian 
      Parliamentary dele-       gation to Nepal led by the Minister of State 
      for Home Affairs (May-June 1987),    and a seventeen member Parliamentary 
      delegation beaded by the Chairman of the       Rashtriya Panchayat to 
      India (November 1987). The Nepalese delegation called    on the 
      President, the Vice-President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Lo 
         k    Sabha anti the Minister for Parliamentary Affairs. Satisfaction 
      was expressed       over the fact that our age-old historical and 
      cultural ties have now been trans    -    lated into a unique form of 
      relationship where borders are free and trade barri    ers    are 
      minimal.       The intensive Indo-Nepal economic collaboration received 
      an added dimen-    sion with the signing of the Agreement on the setting 
      up of the Indo-Nepal Join    t    Commission in June 1987. This was a 
      major breakthrough, since the Agreement    <br>PG3<br>covered 
      virtually all aspects of our bilateral economic activity and brought 
         all    inter-governmental bodies into the framework of the Joint 
      Commission, thereby       enabling the effective monitoring and 
      coordination of benefits accrued in diffe    rent    sectors. A number 
      of meetings covering fresh ground were held in the wake of    this 
      Agreement, including the Committee on Inundation (May 1987), the Inter- 
         Governmental Committee on Trade, Transit and Unauthorised Trade 
      (September    1987), the Karnali Committee (October 1987) and the 
      Secretary level Water    Resources Committee (December 1987). It was also 
      decided that the first meetingof the Joint Commission would be convened in 
      Kathmandu in the near future.       India's role as a leading partner in 
      Nepal's socioeconomic development con-       tinued. Ongoing projects 
      included the construction of a Museum Library-cum-    Documentation 
      Centre at the Institute of Forestry in Hetauda, a Rural Electrifi    - 
         cation Project to electrify 76 Nepalese villages and the construction 
      of 214 km    s.of the Western Sector of the East-West Highway adjoining 
      the Indo-Nepal border. <br><br>With the completion of the construction of 
      the Out-patient Department of the    Bir Hospital with Indian aid and the 
      sophisticated equipment provided by India,       this hospital has 
      become a premier institution in the field of health care in       Nepal. 
      New projects taken up included the setting up of a small-scale industria 
         l    estate at Rajbiraj and Indo-Nepal telecommunications links 
      through INSAT-IB. The traditionally close and friendly relations between 
      India and Bhutan    were further strengthened during the year. The SAARC 
      Summit in Kathmandu    (2 to 4 November 1987) offered an opportunity for 
      discussions on subjects of    mutual interest at the highest level 
      between His Majesty the King of Bhutan    and the Prime Minister, Shri 
      Rajiv Gandhi. The discussions were marked by a    close identity of views 
      and understanding of matters of mutual interest, reflec    ting    the 
      relationship of trust and cooperation that prevails between the two 
      countri    es. In the economic field cooperation flourished. The most 
      prestigious and by    far the largest project in Bhutan to-date is 
      presently under execution with Ind    ian    technical and financial 
      cooperation. The 336 MW Chukha Hydro-Electric Pro-    ject costing 
      approximately Rs. 244 crores had its first two turbines successful    ly 
         commissioned in 1986. The third and fourth units are expected to be 
      operational       shortly. As per the 1974 Chukha Agreement, the 
      Government of India    is committed to the purchase of power surplus to 
      Bhutan's internal requirements ,    Accordingly, parts of West Bengal and 
      Assam have been receiving power from    the 2 X 83 MW Units already 
      commissioned and the Royal Government of    Bhutan has earned over Rs. 
      33.68 crores by selling power to India till the end       of January 
      1988. <br>PG4<br>Discussions are underway to extend substantial 
      financial assistance to    Bhutan for the implementation of Dungsum 
      (Nanglam) Cement Project in Eastern    Bhutan. The 1500-tonne per day 
      cement plant is estimated to cost over Rs. 130       crores and the 
      surplus cement production is to be purchased by India to meet    the 
      demands in the North Eastern region. Discussions are also continuing on a 
            proposal to set up a 45 MW Hydro-Electric Project at Kurichu at an 
      estimated    cost of over Rs. 100 crores.    Economic cooperation 
      continues during Bhutan's Sixth Plan (1987-92).<br> <br>Several mutually 
      beneficial projects are either in an advanced stage of imple-mention or 
      are shortly to begin operations. The Khaling Mini Hydel    Project (0.6 
      MW; Rs. 1.9 crores) was inaugurated by the Indian Ambassador    to Bhutan 
      in March 1988. It has already started supplying power.    The Gyetsa Mini 
      Hydel Project (1.5 MW; Rs. 3.84 crores) is expected to be    completed by 
      April 1988; the Chukha Transmission Line Project (Rs. 18 crores) 
            by mid-1988 and the River Training Works at Dhoti Khola and Paro 
      (Rs. 1.28    crores) by mid-1988. The Taktichu Super Group Drop Project 
      (Rs. 3.7 crores)    and the Paro Airfield Extension Project (over Rs. 6 
      crores) are expected to sta    rt    in early 1988. The Broadcasting 
      Station Project (Rs. 5.9 crores) is expected to    be completed by March 
      1989; the Bongaingaon-Gaylegphug Transmission Line    Project (Rs. 8.55 
      crores) by December 1989 and the Thimpu-Paro Sub-Trans-    mission and 
      Distribution Systems Project (Rs. 11.5 crores) by 1990.    <br><br>Apart from 
      the above, India provided experts and specialists to Bhutan in various 
      fields of forestry, industry, telecommunications, hydel-survey and 
         education etc.       In education, India continues to offer 
      opportunities for secondary as well as higher education, for specialised 
      training in various fields such as defence    ,    police, customs, 
      medicine and engineering etc. Apart from the Government of    India 
      scholarships to about 40 Bhutanese students, a large number of scholar- 
            ships were also provided under the Colombo Plan.       Fruitful 
      efforts were made to strengthen bilateral cultural relations, Dele- 
         gations from the Bhutan-Indian Friendship Associations (BIFA), 
      schools etc.<br> <br>visited India during the year. Assistance was also 
      provided by way of presenta-tion of books and teaching aids etc. and ad 
      hoc subsidies were also provided fo    r    the repair of dzongs and 
      monasteries.       India continued to supply, at Bhutan's request, 
      certain essential commodi-       ties such as wheat, rice, sugar, coal, 
      explosives, steel and edible oils at con    trolled    price.

      <br>PG5<br>The Burmese Foreign Minister U Ye Goung led a 
      delegation to India from 12 to 17 September 1987. During the visit, 
      Instruments of Ratification of the       Maritime Boundary Agreement, 
      signed in Rangoon on 23 December 1986, were    exchanged. With this, the 
      Indo-Burma Agreement on the Delimitation of    the Maritime Boundary has 
      come into force.<br>  <br> The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi and 
      Shrimati Sonia Gandhi paid a visit to Burma or 15 and 16 December 1987 
      at the invitation of the Burmese    Prime Minister, U Maung Maung Kha. 
      During the visit, our Prime Minister had extensive meetings with U Ne 
      Win, Chairman of the Burma Socialist Programme    Party, President U San 
      Yu and also had a round of official talks with the    Burmese Prime 
      Minister.<br><br> The talks centered around ways and means of expan- sion and 
      further consolidation of the existing friendly relations between the t 
      wo    countries. A number of decisions were taken to give a fillip to 
      bilateral relat    ions    between India and Burma. The visit and 
      meetings were marked by great    cordiality and understanding. 
            During the visit, the Prime Minister visited the 2,500 year old 
      Shwedagon       Pagoda and the tomb of Bahadur Shah Zafar. The Prime 
      Minister also returned    to the people of Burma the palm leaf 
      manuscripts containing the despatches of       the 19th century Burmese 
      hero, General Mahabandoola, which were brought by    the British and kept 
      in the Victoria Memorial, Calcutta for the last 100 years. 
         <br><br>India has maintained a continuous dialogue with Pakistan in 
      order to    improve relations with that country. This is in keeping with 
      our commitment    to develop cordial, cooperative and good-neighbourly 
      relations with Pakistan    in accordance with the letter and spirit of 
      the Simla Agreement.       Apart from the PM-Zia Meeting (New Delhi, 21 
      February 1987) and    the PM-Junejo Meeting (Kathmandu, 4 November 1987), 
      a number of impor-    tant bilateral meetings were held during the year. 
      Pursuant to the first round       of talks (New Delhi, 30 January to 4 
      February 1987), Shri A. S. Gonsalves,    Secretary, Ministry of External 
      Affairs, held talks in Islamabad from 27    February to 4 March 1987 with 
      the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, Abdul Sattar    on the defusion of border 
      tension. The meeting resulted in an agreement on    de-escalation along 
      the border. <br><br>As had been decided at the Home Secretary    level talks in 
      December 1986, committees to evolve fresh Border Ground Rules and to 
      deal with drug trafficking and smuggling also met. Inspite of Pakistan's 
         unwillingness to move towards nondiscriminatory trade relations 
      with India, <br>PG6<br>the meetings of Sub-Commissions I and II 
      of the Indo-Pak Joint Commission,    dealing with economic cooperation 
      and trade, were convened in August 1987,    followed in December 1987 by 
      talks at the Planning Secretary and Commerce    Secretary level. Talks 
      were also held in April 1987 to discuss other issues    such as the 
      problems arising from the detention of fishermen and fishing vessel    s 
      by India and Pakistan and the Tulbul Navigation Project.<br> <br>Our 
      sincere sentiments for good relations have not been reciprocated by 
         Pakistan, as is evident from a series of negative actions taken by it 
      which hav    e    initiated the atmosphere, adversely affecting our 
      relations. These include its       weapons-oriented nuclear policy, its 
      quest for sophisticated weapons like AWACS       far beyond its genuine 
      defence requirements, its involvement with extremist    activities 
      directed against India, its orchestrated and concerted efforts to in 
         ter-    nationalize the Kashmir issue, its resorting to offensive 
      military action in th    e    Siachen area, its unwillingness to have 
      non-discriminatory trade relations with       India and its reluctance 
      to increase people-to-people contacts. <br><br>India took a careful note 
      of developments concerning the Afghan situation.       During the year, 
      the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)    initiated the 
      policy of national reconciliation under which it offered to share power 
      with the Afghan opposition both within and outside the country.    Both 
      the Soviet Union and Afghanistan offered withdrawal of Soviet troops 
         from Afghanistan in a period of 12 months or less provided this was 
      accompanied       by cessation of external interference.       India, 
      as a country in the region, is deeply affected by the situation in 
         Afghanistan. Accordingly, we have initiated contacts with various 
      Afghan    opposition elements and the countries involved in the Afghan 
      situation in order    to help contribute towards a political solution. 
      Our efforts are continuing.    We are in favour of a non-aligned, 
      independent and stable Afghanistan. <br><br>India's bilateral relations 
      with Afghanistan developed satisfactorily durin    g    the year. 
      President Najibullah made brief halts in New Delhi in December    1987 
      while transiting through India en route to Vietnam and Kampuchea and 
         back. This opportunity was utilised for an exchange of views on 
      matters of    bilateral and regional importance. Earlier, Foreign 
      Minister Wakil had paid    a visit to Delhi in February 1987. The then 
      External Affairs Minister, Shri    N.D. Tiwari also visited Kabul in May 
      1987 for attending the Eighth Session    of the Indo-Afghan Joint 
      Commission on Economic, Technical and Trade matters.<br>PG7<br> 
      India's ITEC programme in Afghanistan which is directed at benefit    ing 
         the common man in areas such as public health, small-scale industry, 
      education,       etc. was continued during the year under review. A 
      major tidal wave hit the Maldives in April 1987 causing extensive 
         damage to property, especially to the International Airport at Male. 
      In res-    ponse to a message from President Gayoom to our Prime Minister 
      requesting    relief assistance and help in surveying the damage to the 
      Airport, the Prime    Minister announced an assistance of Rs. 20 lakhs. 
      Under this, 15 tonnes of    bleaching powder and 48,000 doses of cholera 
      vaccine were rushed to the    Maldives. A team from the International 
      Airports Authority of India also    visited the Maldives from 18 to 20 
      April 1987 and their report has been banded over to the Government of 
      Maldives. <br><br>Relations with the Maldives continued to be close and 
      cordial. In February       1987, the Maldivian Trade Minister, Mr. Ilyas 
      Ibrahim visited India along with       a three-member delegation to 
      discuss ways and means of expanding trade and    industrial collaboration 
      with India.    <br><br>The Government remains firmly committed to the removal 
      of the military presence of extra-regional powers from the Indian 
      Ocean and is concerned    about developments in the region which led to a 
      build-up of foreign military forces. The Government was therefore 
      disappointed at the further postponement       upto 1990, of the 
      deadline for convening an International Conference on the    Indian Ocean 
      as a Zone of Peace under the aegis of the UN.       SAARC experienced 
      considerable expansion in its activities during 1987-    88 alongside 
      progress in the Integrated Programme of Action in the eleven    areas of 
      cooperation (Agriculture, Prevention of Drug Trafficking and Drug 
         Abuse, Health, Meteorology, Postal Services, Rural Development, 
      Science and    Technology, Sports, Arts and Culture, Telecommunications, 
      Transport and    Women in Development).<br><br> India handed over the 
      Chairmanship to Nepal at    the Third SAARC Summit in Kathmandu in 
      November 1987, at the end of a    term during which almost 100 activities 
      had been organised. Of these, India    had hosted 45. The Summit provided 
      the occasion for a review of SAARC    activities during 1987. The 
      following highlights of the Summit give an indica- tion of the 
      work done in these areas during the year : <br>PG8<br>1. SAARC 
      Food Security Reserve (SFSR)    Following extensive discussions at the 
      official level (initially under FAO       auspices), the Council of 
      Ministers which met in New Delhi in June 1987    decided in principle to 
      establish a SAARC Food Security Reserve, by which member countries 
      could draw on food stocks in the event of an emergency.<br> <br>The Agreement 
      establishing the SFSR was signed at the Third SAARC Summit.    The 
      Agreement is a landmark in regional cooperation. This is the first time 
         that countries of the region have decided to pool their resources to 
      help one       another in an emergency.<br> 2. Environmental Matters 
            At India's initiative, a seminar on disaster relief management was 
      held in       1987 to consider the most fruitful ways of cooperating in 
      this area. At    the Third SAARC Summit, the leaders decided to 
      commission a study    on the causes and consequences of natural disasters 
      and the protection    and preservation of the environment in the context 
      of recurrent    national disasters in the region. The Secretary-General 
      has been    entrusted with the task of having the study conducted. 
      <br>3.Terrorism       The Dhaka Summit had decided that SAARC 
      should examine the prob-    lem of terrorism as it affected the region, 
      with a view to cooperating    in combating this scourge. Following 
      preliminary work at two meet-    ings in Dhaka in 1986, a Group of 
      Experts met in New Delhi in    March 1987 and succeeded in identifying 
      offences which are to be    regarded as terroristic, and which, for 
      purposes of extradition, are not    to be regarded as political. There 
      was also agreement on action re-    quired at the national, bilateral and 
      regional levels such as accession    to existing international 
      conventions, harmonisation of domestic    legislation, and exchange of 
      information and expertise. <br><br>The Council of Ministers decided to 
      concretise these efforts with the drafting of a Regional Convention on 
      the Suppression of Terrorism, which was signed at the Third SAARC 
      Summit.<br>4. Expansion of Activities for People-to-People Contact 
            Five new ideas approved by the Heads of State or Government at the 
         Bangalore Summit, to promote people-to-people contact in SAARC 
      <br>PG9<br>countries, were translated into full-fledged schemes. 
      One of them, the    SAARC Audio-Visual Exchange (SAVE) was launched on 2 
      Novem-    ber 1987, to coincide with the opening of the Third SAARC 
      Summit.    Under this scheme, a television and a radio programme from 
      each of    the member countries, by rotation, will be broadcast 
      throughout the    region on the 1st and 15th of each month respectively. 
      Organised    tourism, with facilities for limited convertibility of 
      national currencies,    is to be launched by 1 July 1988. The scheme for 
      SAARC Chairs    Fellowships/Scholarships is to begin from the academic 
      year 1988.<br> <br>India is to host a meeting of the Documentation Experts 
      Committee in March 1988 in connection with the establishment of the 
      SAARC    Documentation Centre. Arrangements are also being made for the 
         launching of the SAARC Youth Volunteers Programme.    <br>5. Planning 
            A second meeting of SAARC Planners took place in Islamabad in 
      October    1987 in pursuance of a decision of the Bangalore Summit (the 
      first    meeting had been held in New Delhi in 1983). The meeting of 
      Plan-    ners is now to take place annually. Based on the recommendations 
      of    the group, studies are to be initiated in the following 
      areas--analysis    of trade regimes vis-a-vis industrial protection 
      policies of member    countries, quantification of the benefits of 
      intra-regional trade expan-    sion and establishment of a mechanism for 
      financing short duration    trade imbalances, joint ventures and national 
      systems of industrial promotion and regulation. <br><br>A data bank on 
      socioeconomic indicators of member countries is to be    established 
      according to a format to be devised by the Documentation    Expert 
      Committee at its first meeting. <br><br>As a follow-up to another 
      recommendation of the Planners' meeting, India    is to host a meeting of 
      experts in the field of developing energy mode!-    ling techniques. 
            SAARC adopted uniform guidelines for the sharing of institutional 
      costs    of regional institutions, and for other administrative and 
      budgetary procedures in this connection, at a meeting held in Kathmandu in 
      May    1987. Regional institutions are to be established in association 
      with    national institutions, as far as possible, to save on capital 
      expenditure,    the guiding parameters for their establishment being 
      economy and    efficiency. <br>PG10<br>Member: countries have 
      agreed to establish a SAARC Meteorological Research Centre and a SAARC 
      Agricultural Information Centre in    India and Bangladesh respectively. 
      The possibility of setting up regional    institution in a few other 
      areas is also being considered.    <br><br>Administrative and financial 
      decisions regarding the SAARC Secretariat enabled it to become fully 
      functional during the year. India contributed    a terracotta mural from 
      Rajasthan to the SAARC Secretariat for the    Conference Hall. 
            The third session of the Council of Ministers took place as 
      scheduled in    New Delhi in June 1987 and was preceded by the eighth 
      session of    the Standing Committee and the third session of the 
      Programming Committee. All the three bodies met again in Kathmandu prior 
      to the    Third Summit.       India has announced a contribution of Rs. 
      17.5 million towards SAARC. <br><br>activities for the year 1988-89. India 
      looks forward to further progress in the growth of regional 
      cooperation as envisaged by the SAARC    Charter.

       India's friendly relations with the 
      countries in the South-East Asian region       continue to progress 
      smoothly. The mutual desire to further develop and    diversify bilateral 
      cooperation, which found particular expression during the       visit of 
      the Prime Minister of India to some of the countries in the region in 
            October 1986 has been further manifested in the form of increased 
      high-level exchanges and broadened interaction in economic, commercial and 
      other    areas. <br><br>The Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri 
      K. Natwar Singh, visited    Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore 
      during March 1987 and the    Philippines during April 1987 and had a 
      useful exchange of views on various    matters of bilateral interst and 
      regional issues. <br><br>Mr. Daim Zainuddin, Minister of Finance, and Dr. 
      Lin Keng Yark,    Minister of Primary Industries of Malaysia, visited 
      India from 28 November to Dec 04, 1987, and had discussions with Shri N. 
      D. Tiwari, Minister of    Finance and Commerce, on possibilities of 
      stepping up the India-Malaysia trade       and reducing the trade 
      imbalance which continues to be in Malaysia's favour.<br><br>A delegation 
      from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
      (FICCI) visited Malaysia in April 1987 and later in July 1987 for the 
            first meeting of the India-Malaysia Joint Business Cooperation 
      Committee. An    exclusive Indian Trade Exhibition was organised in Kuala 
      Lumpur from 14 to 23 January 1988. <br><br>The Minister of State for 
      Commerce, Shri P. R. Das Munshi, visited    Singapore to inaugurate the 
      Indian Trade Exhibition which was organised by    the Trade Fair 
      Authority of India from 6 to 12 April 1987. A trade delegation 
            from the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and 
      Industry, visited <br>PG12<br>India during April-May 1987 and 
      signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Federation of the Indian 
      Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). <br><br>An agreement on 
      Avoidance of Double Taxation with the Republic of    Indonesia was signed 
      in Jakarta on 7 August 1987. A delegation of experts    from Indonesia 
      visited India during December 1987 to discuss possible areas    of 
      cooperation in the field of science and technology. An Agreement on 
         Scientific and Technological Cooperation with the Republic of 
      Phillippines was       signed on 8 April 1987 in Manila during the visit 
      of tie Minister of State or       External Affairs, Shri K. Natwar 
      Singh. India's relations with the three Indo-China states remain extremely 
      cordial.<br><br>India's efforts have been directed towards finding a 
      peaceful, negotiated, poli tical    settlement in Kampuchea, 
      involving all the concerned parties. The visit of    Shri K. Natwar 
      Singh, the Minister of State for External Affairs, to the ASEAN 
            and the Indo-China states in April-May and June-July 1987 
      respectively, created       a better understanding between the ASEAN and 
      the Indo-China states, and    fostered a dialogue between the Kampuchean 
      factions. India has supported    and helped to foster the dialogue 
      between Prince Sihanouk and Prime Minister    Hun Sen of the People's 
      Republic of Kampuchea. It has been seen as a break-    through in the 
      nine-year impasse and although interrupted, has started a proces    s 
         towards a possible settlement. <br><br>India's economic and technical 
      assistance to the Indo-China region con-    tinued to be channelled 
      through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation       (ITEC) 
      programme. Training in fields such as science and technology, 
         management, agriculture, fisheries, cinematography, forestry, space 
      studies,    atomic energy, animal husbandry, classical dance and music, 
      etc. under the    ITEC and other programmes were provided to the nominees 
      from the Indo-    China countries. Indian experts were also deputed to 
      these countries. <br><br>Credits, commodity loans and grant assistance 
      were made available to    Vietnam. The various decisions of the Second 
      Indo-Vietnamese Joint Commis-    sion (November 1985), were implemented 
      during the year under review. Science    and Technology delegations have 
      been exchanged and a working programme    has been finalised. The 
      Indo-Vietnamese Treaty for Cooperation in the    Peaceful Uses of Atomic 
      Energy has been ratified and the programme for <br>PG13<br>cooperation 
      has been finalised. An Indian telecommunication delegation visit    ed 
         Vietnam and identified areas of cooperation. Two research centres, one 
      in anima    l    husbandry and forage, and the other in rice under the 
      ITEC programme, are    functioning smoothly. <br><br>In Kampuchea, the 
      Archaeological Survey of India commenced work on    Phase II of the 
      Angkor Vat Restoration. The project is financed under the    ITEC 
      programme. The Kampuchean authorities have appreciated India's 
         assistance. The hospital at Svey Rieng is also being renovated with 
      Indian    assistance, and Indian doctors are being deputed to run the 
      hospital. In    collaboration with the Kampuchean Government, India is 
      processing the    establishment of a rice seed farm. Pumps for drought 
      relief are being supplied       to Kampuchea. <br><br>The Government of 
      India gifted 55 pumps to Laos. India has been    participating in the 
      Interim Mekong Projects with Laos as the target country.       Relief 
      medicines and cloth are being supplied. India has pledged to establish one 
      small-scale unit in Laos.       The friendly bilateral relations with 
      the countries of the South Pacific, ex    cept    for the regrettable 
      exception of Fiji, continued throughout the year under revi    ew. 
      <br><br>The Prime Minister's visits to Australia and New Zealand in October 
      1986 had given the necessary impetus to the strengthening of bilateral 
      relations with th    ese    countries. Follow-up to the visit to 
      Australia continued in the form of a meeti    ng of the Joint Business 
      Council in March 1987, a senior officials' meeting in    April 1987, and 
      a visit by the Secretary in the Australian Ministry of Foreign 
            Affairs and Trade in September 1987. The last two meetings in 
      particular aimed       at reviewing, monitoring and directing bilateral 
      relations. India and Australia       signed, during the year under 
      review, a Memorandum of Understanding on Space    research. Progress was 
      also made on the conclusion of another Memorandum    of Understanding on 
      cooperation in meteorology.<br><br> Business delegations were exchanged to 
      step up trade and economic interaction. The India-New Zealand Joint Trade 
      Committee had its first meeting in June, 1987 in New Delhi. 
      <br>PG14<br>The President of Vanuatu, Ati George Sokomanu, paid 
      a goodwill, visit to    India from 13 to 16 December 1987. <br><br>Fiji 
      was the only country in the South Pacific with which India's relations 
            suffered a set-back following a coup there on 14 May 1987. In the 
      wake of    the coup, a systematic campaign was launched to deprive the 
      Indian community    in Fiji of its guaranteed constitutional rights. The 
      discrimination was being       made solely on the basis of the racial 
      origin of the community. Moves were    also afoot to change the existing 
      Constitution which had given the Indians a       modicum of fair 
      treatment and parity. India expressed its deep concern at the 
            overthrow of the democratically elected popular government in 
      Fiji.<br><br>India    also condemned the racial overtone of the actions of the 
      military regime in Fij    i at international forums like the United 
      Nations General Assembly and the    Commonwealth Heads of Government 
      meeting. India suspended bilateral trade and economic cooperation with 
      Fiji and India's High Commissioner to Fiji was recalled for 
      consultations. India has taken the position that any future 
         constitutional arrangements in Fiji, to be viable and effective, would 
      have to    be    fair and acceptable to all the communities there. 
      <br><br>India offered cyclone relief worth Rs. 5 lakhs each to Fiji and

       CHAPTER III 
      <br><br>EAST ASIA <br><br>During the year under review, the Government's 
      desire to renew and    revitalise relations with China and to build a 
      climate of mutual trust between       India and China, was conveyed to 
      the Chinese Government. Our Government's    intention to continue to make 
      sincere efforts to reach a satisfactory and mutua    lly    acceptable 
      settlement of the boundary question was also emphasized. It was 
         stressed that good relations between India and China are important, 
      not just    for both countries, but for Asia and for world peace. 
            The transit visit of the then Minister for External Affairs, Shri 
      N. D. Tiwa    ri    to beijing in May 1987, was a further indication of 
      the Government's desire to       defuse tension on the border with 
      China. There was a better understanding of    each other's positions as a 
      result of the visit. It was stressed that a new beg    inning    should 
      be made to dispel any misunderstanding and suspicions of the past. The 
      Eighth Round of Official-Level Talks between India and China was    held 
      in New Delhi from 15 to Nov 17, 1987.<br><br> The talks were held in a 
         positive, and constructive atmosphere. The Government's desire to 
      reach a    satisfactory boundary settlement, to maintain peace and 
      tranquillity on the bor    der    and to make progress in other spheres 
      of bilateral relations was conveyed to    the Chinese delegation. It was 
      recognised that the border question is one which       is deeply 
      embedded in the psyche of both peoples and that it will have to be tackled

      political, economic and cultural fields with the    countries of the West 
      Asia and North Africa region were further consolidated    and diversified 
      during the year under review.    India persisted with its policy of 
      firm and unequivocal support for the    Palestinian cause. It has lent 
      active support in all relevant international for    a such    as the UN 
      and NAM to efforts for a comprehensive, just and equitable settlementof 
      the Palestinian problem including the proposal for a UN sponsored Inter- 
         national Conference on the Middle East. The visit of Mr. Yasser 
      Arafat, Chair-       man of the PLO, in August 1987 underscored the 
      strong ties between India and       the Palestinian people. Shri B. 
      Shankaranand, the then Minister for Water    Resources, had earlier 
      represented India at the Algiers session of the Palestin    e 
         National Council in April 1987. A close political dialogue was 
      maintained with Jordan and efforts to enhance       bilateral economic 
      cooperation continued. The Indo-Jordanian Committee on    Trade and 
      Commerce met in New Delhi in March 1987 to give a further boost    to 
      bilateral trade and commercial relations. <br><br>Our relations with Syria 
      also continued to strengthen. The Minister of State       for 
      Agriculture visited Syria in May 1987 to discuss possibilities of 
      increased       bilateral interaction in the field of agriculture. The 
      Syrian Vice Minister of       Foreign Affairs. Mr. Diaullah Al Fattal

      were held on bilateral relations as well as regional an    d 
         international issues of common interest. <br><pg23><br><br>   The 
      growing warmth in Judo-Egyptian relations continued during the year 
         with renewed interest in bilateral cooperation in various fields. 
      Regular high-       level exchanges on various matters of regional and 
      bilateral interest also took       place. An Egyptian Parliamentary 
      delegation visited India in October 1987.    Our Minister of State for 
      Health led a delegation to Cairo on a study tour in       June 1987. A 
      number of proposals for cooperation in science and technology, 
         agriculture, energy, industry and trade with Egypt are under active 
      considerati    on. <br><br>Our relations with the three States in the 
      Horn of Africa viz. Djibouti,    Sudan and Somalia continued to remain 
      steady.       In the Maghreb region we continued with our close 
      cooperation and con-    sultations with Algeria, India was represented by 
      a high-level delegation led b    y    Shrimati Mohsina Kidwai, Minister 
      for Urban Development, at the Twenty-fifth    Anniversary of Algerian 
      Independence in July 1987. Shri B. Shankaranand, the    then Minister for 
      Water Resources, visited Algeria in April 1987 to discuss pos    si- 
         bilities of Indo-Algerian cooperation in the field of hydraulics. 
      Further, duri    ng    the official visit of Dr. Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, 
      Foreign Minister of Algeria in       January 1988, wide-ranging 
      discussions were held on bilateral relations and int    er-    national 
      issues of mutual interest. With Tunisia too, there were encouraging 
         prospects of development of cooperation in the industrial and economic 
      fields. <br><br>Relations with Libya continued to be good and efforts to 
      solve the problem of       outstanding payments to Indian companies 
      continued. An ever-increasing number       of Indian doctors, engineers 
      and other personnel were recruited for services in       various sectors 
      of the Libyan economy. Following the opening of the Embassy    of the 
      Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic in Delhi, our Ambassador to Algeria 
         has been concurrently accredited to the SADR. Relief items worth 
      several lakhs       were despatched to the Saharawi Red Cross Society 
      during the year. <br><br>Relations between India and the six countries of 
      the Gulf Cooperation    Council, namely, Saudi. Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait 
      Bahrain, Qatar and Oman    continued to be cordial during the year under 
      review, These relations are chara    c-    terised by in important 
      economic dimension. Bilateral trade with the Gulf    countries continued 
      to increase during the year. The presence of over 7 lakh    Indian 
      workers whose services are valued constitutes a major link between India 
            and these countries. Despite recessionary tendencies owing to the 
      fall in off p    rices    it was possible, through our efforts, to 
      maintain India's share in the Gulf lab    our    market. Indian Missions 
      which now have full-fledged officers looking after labo    ur 
      <br><pg24><br><br>   work continued to provide necessary consular 
      assistance to Indian, emigrant    s in    these countries. 
            During the year, these countries have shown greater interest in 
      investing    in India. The Indo-OAPEC Seminar held in New Delhi in 
      February 1987 and    the Gulf Organisation for Industrial Consultancy 
      (GOIC) Seminar held in Doha    in May 1987 provided investors from the 
      Gulf countries a better understanding       about investment 
      opportunities in India. The process of persuading the Gulf    countries 
      about the advantages of investing in India is continuing. <br><br>A 
      Special Envoy of the Amir of Kuwait visited New Delhi in June 1987 
         with a message from the Amir for our Prime Minister relating to 
      escalation of       the conflict in the Gulf.       A direct telephone 
      link between the UAE and India has been established    with the 
      inauguration of the tele-link by the Minister of Communications. 
      <br><br>Relations with Iran have continued to grow. There were several 
      exchanges    of visits between the two countries during the year. In 
      February 1987 the Fourt    h    session of the Indo-Iran Joint 
      Commission was held in New Delhi. In October    an Indian Parliamentary 
      delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha visited       Iran. In 
      December the Iranian Minister of Heavy Industries visited India for 
         discussions on new areas of industrial cooperation. The Fifth session 
      of the    Indo-Iran Joint Commission is due to be held in Tehran in the 
      near future. <br><br>Relations with Iraq have been warm and cordial. An 
      Indian Parliamentary    delegation led by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha 
      visited Baghdad in October 1987.       An Iraqi Parliamentary delegation 
      is due to visit in April 1988. India    participated in the Annual 
      Baghdad International Trade Fair. A deferred pay-    ment arrangement 
      with Iraq to settle outstanding payments due to Indian com-    panies has 
      been working satisfactorily. <br><br>The Iran-Iraq war which has entered 
      its eighth year continues with little    apparent prospect of a 
      negotiated settlement. While the UN Security Council 
      <br><pg25><br><br>   Resolution 598 has been broadly supported its 
      implementation is fraught with       difficulty. The already tense 
      situation in the region was seriously aggravated       during 1987 by 
      the escalation of foreign naval presence in the Gulf. India has 
            expressed concern over this enhancement of tension in a region 
      neighbouring    our country.       India has been in touch with both 
      Iraq and Iran on the war. The Principal    Adviser to the Iranian 
      President visited India and met the Prime Minister in    January 1987 to 
      brief him on the Iranian position on the war. In February    1987 the 
      Iranian Foreign Minister who was in Delhi in connection with the    Joint 
      Commission meeting also put across Iran's perspective on the war. There 
            were further exchanges of views between the two sides during 
      Secretary (West)'s       visit to Tehran in August 1987 and the Iranian 
      Foreign Minister Velayati's    visit to New Delhi in November 1987. 
      <br><br>Relations with the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's 
      Demo-    cratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) were consolidated during 1987.

      <br><br>AFRICA (SOUTH OF THE SAHARA)<br>With the countries of Africa 
      (South of the Sahara), India's relations conti-       nued to grow 
      satisfactorily. Significant efforts were made to strengthen India'    s 
         links with the Frontline States and Liberation Movements in South 
      Africa. India       continued to play a major role in the struggle waged 
      in Southern Africa for dis    -    mantlement of the abhorrent system of 
      apartheid and the abolition of the last       vestige of colonialism in 
      that part of the world. <br><br>Shri Anand Sharma, MP, the then President 
      of the Indian Youth Congress,    attended the International Conference on 
      "Repression and the Law in Apartheid       in South Africa" in Harare 
      from 24 to Sep 27, 1987.       In June 1987, in New Delhi, an African 
      Festival was organised and Africa    Day was celebrated.       At the 
      Meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, held in Van-    couver 
      in October 1987, India succeeded in frustrating attempts at diluting man 
         -    datory comprehensive sanctions against the Pretoria regime. A

      of Government, held in Van-    couver in October 1987, India succeeded in 
      frustrating attempts at diluting man    -    datory comprehensive 
      sanctions against the Pretoria regime. A consensus for continuing the 
      sanctions remained solid.   <br> <br>India participated in the "Solidarity 
      Conference" organised by the African    National Congress (ANC) in 
      Tanzania from 1 to 4 December 1987 to celebrate    its Seventy-fifth 
      Anniversary. The Indian delegation was led by the Minister of 
            State for Commerce, Shri P. R. Das Munshi. The Ministry of 
      External Affairs    provided interpreters and supplied stationery for use 
      during the conference. <br><br>The AFRICA Fund, established at the Eighth 
      Conference of the Heads of State Government of Non-aligned countries, has 
      had an active year Following the    <br><pg28>   <br><br>Summit meeting 
      of the AFRICA Fund Committee, held in New Delhi on 24 and    25 January 
      1987, the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi had written to all the 
            Heads of State/Government forwarding a copy of the appeal and Plan 
      of Action    and calling upon all nations to contribute generously to the 
      AFRICA Fund. As    part of the efforts at mobilising resources for the 
      AFRICA Fund, Shri N.    Krishnan, Special Envoy of the Prime Minister 
      undertook fund raising    missions to selected countries accompanied by 
      the Ambassador of Zambia to    Sweden as the representative of the 
      Vice-Chairman of the Fund. The first missio    n    in March 1987 took 
      them to Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy and    Belgium. In April 
      1987, they, visited Kuwait and in May 1987 the UAE, Bahrain       and 
      Canada. Detailed presentations were made on the AFRICA Fund, emphasis- 
         ing the role of the Fund as a catalyst for promoting additional flow 
      of assista    nce    to the Frontline States as well as liberation 
      movements. During these visits sy    m-    pathy and support for the 
      objectives of the Fund were expressed. Most donors    are already heavily 
      involved in developmental projects in the Southern Africa       region 
      bilaterally, through the Southern African Development Coordination Con 
            ference (SADCC) and or through the UN and other multilateral 
      agencies. <br><br>Discussions were also held with the UN agencies, the 
      Secretary-General of    the Commonwealth and the European Economic 
      Community (EEC). The Sec-    retary-General of the UN gave full personal 
      endorsement and promised support of the UN system to the AFRICA Fund. 
      Meetings were held with the Inter-    national Labour Organisation (ILO), 
      the United Nations High Commissioner for    Refugees (UNHCR), the 
      International Fund for Agricultural Development    (IFAD) as well as an 
      inter-agency meeting chaired by the Director General for 
            Development and International Economic Cooperation. As a result of 
      these    efforts, there is scope for considerable Cooperation and, 
      coordination between    the    UN agencies and the AFRICA Fund. The UNDP 
      have agreed to consider pro-    viding technical assistance for specific 
      projects. The IFAD has earmarked funds</pg28></td></tr>

      Krishnan and Ambassador Kazinga also called on the Secretary-General 
         of the Commonwealth, as a result of which, the Commonwealth Fund for 
         Technical Cooperation (CFTC) have made available many project profiles 
      and    agreed to collaborate constructively through the provision of 
      technical assista    nce    for the AFRICA Fund projects.  <br>  <br>Useful 
      meetings were held with the European Economic Commission opening up 
      possibilities of coordination between the activities of the EEC and 
         the AFRICA Fund. <br><pg29><br><br>   On the whole, the response to 
      the AFRICA Fund has been encouraging and    contributions and pledges 
      during the course of the year under review have    reached US $ 242 
      million as on 1 December 1987.       The governments of a number of 
      States comprising the AFRICA Fund    Committee including their leaders 
      have been active in creating, Awareness about       the Fund and 
      soliciting support for it. Several other projects were taken up pu    b- 
         licising the objectives of the Fund and for mobilising international 
      public opi    nion    against apartheid. A special brochure on, the 
      subject of the AFRICA Fund was    widely distributed through the India 
      Missions abroad to government leaders and       officials, voluntary 
      organizations, academic and other institutions as well as    emi- 
         nent persons in different walks of life. Special persons and groups 
      active agai    nst    apartheid were identified in various countries and 
      contact established with the    m    with a view to spread the message 
      of the AFRICA Fund. The message of the    AFRICA Fund was further spread 
      through seminars, conferences and meetings.    A special, presentation on 
      AFRICA Fund was made at the meeting of the Asso-    ciation of West 
      European Parliamentarians for Action against Apartheid held at 
            Strassburg in May 1987. Two delegations of Indian Parliamentarians 
      visited a    number of countries in connection with the convening by the 
      Parliamentarians    Action for Removal of Apartheid (PARA) (India 
      Chapter) of a global prepara-    tory meeting in Delhi in August 1987 to 
      prepare for an eventual world confer-       ence of Parliamentarians 
      against apartheid. <br><br>A meeting of the senior officials of the AFRICA 
      Fund Committee was held    in Delhi from 4 to 7 August 1987 to review the 
      progress of the AFRICA Fund.       The subcommittee meeting was held on 
      6 August 1987 under the chairmanship    of Zambia at which all the 
      Frontline States and liberation movements as well as       donor 
      countries were present. The meeting enabled donor and recipient countries 
            to meet for the first time and take full advantage of the 
      opportunity to intera    ct    with each other and establish informal 
      contacts. The Frontline States were able       to present updated list 
      of their priority requirements. A number of donors and       UN agencies 
      made brief references and, amongst others, India was able to    announce 
      the list of projects which it intended to take up for implementation 
            from its contributions to the AFRICA Fund. <br><br>At the Summit 
      meeting held in January 1987, the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv 
            Gandhi had announced India's contribution of Rs. 50 crores to the 
      AFRICA    Fund. Thereafter an exercise was mounted to identify the 
      specific projects that       India could take up for implementation

       the August 1987 
      meeting of the senior officials, India was able to give a list 
         <br><pg30><br><br>   of projects that it intends to take up. The 
      value of the projects identified    so far    is approximately Rs. 35 
      crores. Transport vehicles valued at approximately    Rs. 4 crores were 
      supplied initially to Tanzania and more are to follow soon. 
            Essential goods, including medicines and transport vehicles valued 
      at Rs. 1.5    crores were sent to the African National Congress (ANC). 
      Transport vehicles,    medicines and other items are being supplied to 
      South West Africa People's    Organisation (SWAPO) valued at Rs. 1.5 
      crores. Orders for supply of 100    railway wagons to Zambia have been 
      placed with the Projects and Equipment    Corporation of India Limited 
      (PEC). Other projects relating to Mozambique,    Botswana, etc. are under 
      active consideration. Agreements were reached with the       Governments 
      of Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique laying down the terms and 
         conditions under which Indian projects were being implemented under 
      the    AFRICA Fund. <br><br>Within India there has been considerable 
      interest generated in the AFRICA    Fund. Public response would have been 
      greater but for the unfortunate situation       created within the 
      country on account of the unprecedented drought. Even so    contributions 
      from the public totalling Rs. 30 lakhs have been received. A Soci    ety 
         named Africa Fund has been established with the Prime Minister as the 
      President       and registered with the Registrar of Societies, Delhi. A 
      Government Body of Senior Officials has been set up for supervising the 
      activities of the Society.       Medicines valued at Rs. 25 lakhs were 
      donated to Mozambique by the Society. <br><br>The second meeting of the 
      senior officials of the AFRICA Fund Committee    was held in Brazzaville, 
      Congo, from 14 to 16 January 1988. The Chairman's    Report on the 
      activities of the Fund since the first meeting of senior official    s 
         in August 1987, was presented by India. The Committee noted with 
      satisfaction    the progress achieved so far, and the fact that the 
      pledges announced by over       forty countries are approaching US $ one 
      quarter billion. The dynamic role    played by our Prime Minister and 
      India was acclaimed.       Bilateral relations with the countries of 
      Africa continued to grow. A number       of high-level visits were, 
      exchanged. <br><br>The Mauritian Minister of Health visited India in May 
      1987 and held    discussions with the then Minister of Health. The then 
      Minister for External    Affairs, Shri N. D. Tiwari, visited Mauritius 
      for the Indo-Mauritian Joint Com-mission meeting in July 1987. The 
      Minister for Human Resource Development    led the Indian delegation, 
      which included the Minister of State for Education a    nd    Culture, 
      for participation in Mauritius' Festival International de la Mer.

       CHAPTER VI 
      <br><br>EUROPE<br><br>WESTERN EUROPE<br>       Western Europe as a 
      political and economic grouping constitutes an import-    ant factor in 
      world affairs. Despite the inequities of size and economic    potential 
      these countries have attempted to carve out for themselves, a role 
         larger than they would be in a position to play were they to seek it 
      as individ    ual    nations. Together they constitute an affluent and 
      sophisticated market. With ju    stabout 81/2% of the world's population 
      they account for about 50% of the world       GDP and 40% of 
      international trade. The Twelve-Nation European Economic    Community is 
      perhaps the largest trading bloc in the world and is a Significant 
            trading partner of India. <br><br>India's relations with the 
      countries of Western Europe continue to be cordial       and friendly. 
      There was a broad similarity of views based on a belief in politi    cal 
         and negotiated settlements for resolving international problems and 
      reducing    tensions, even if there were difference's on specific issues. 
      With Western Euro    pe    increasingly seeking to play a more 
      independent role and craft a more distinct       political personality, 
      while remaining within the western alliances system, the    ir    policy 
      positions on questions of East-West and North-South relations are not 
         dissimilar to those of India.       For India, Western Europe 
      continued to remain important as a major trad-    ing partner, as a 
      source of economic assistance and for technology transfer. In 
            addition, there is the need for political cooperation for curbing 
      terrorism and       extremist activity designed to harm India's security 
      interests. For the West    European countries India was seen as a growing 
      economy, supported by policies       of liberalisation and political 
      stability, providing enormous opportunities for    in-    vestments and 
      a market for goods and services. The highly export dependant    economics 
      of Western Europe, which are constantly in search for new markets 
      <br><pg33><br><br>   considered India as one of the most important areas 
      in Asia. India has incre    asingly    come to be recognised as the most 
      important country in the South Asian region and potentially one of the 
      most promising political and economic systems in Asi    a. <br><br>The 
      twelve members of the European Community continue to be our major 
         trading partners and cooperation with the community was pursued 
      vigorously in       the fields of industrial cooperation, in science and 
      technology and in investme    nt.    Countries of the region, and more 
      specifically the Scandinavian countries, exte    nd-    ed economic 
      assistance for projects in the fields of social welfare, health and rural 
      development.       In an otherwise positive area of economic and 
      commercial interaction the    only cause for concern was the deficit in 
      the balance of trade which continued       to show an increase. While 
      the overall exports to Western Europe increased in       volume, the 
      range of products remained limited. The reasons for this are the 
         favourable investment climate in India, the liberalisation in the 
      import of cap    ital goods and our enhanced requirements for the import 
      of new technology. A contri-       butory factor has also been the 
      protective trade policies of the European Com-       munity. Our 
      concerns have been expressed clearly in bilateral discussions with 
            representatives of individual countries as well as to the European 
      Community    and specific measures have been sought to be adopted to 
      remedy the imbalances. Meetings of the Joint Economic and Trade Committees 
      were held with    Sweden and France during 1987. The expansion of Indian 
      exports, commodity    and quantum-wise increase in investment, joint 
      collaborations, transfer of tech    -    nology and counter trade 
      arrangements were the focus of discussions. <br><br>In order to curb 
      anti-Indian activities carried out in and from countries in Western 
      Europe, we have closely monitored those activities and sought the co- 
            operation of individual governments. Most governments in Western 
      Europe have    been responsive to our concerns and have, in specific 
      cases, cooperated activel    y    in curtailing these activities. 
            Our specific concerns have been expressed to the British 
      authorities and    their cooperation requested in curbing anti-Indian 
      activities in and from the U    K.    Some limited progress in this 
      regard has been achieved. Negotiations with the </pg33></td></tr>

            International issues and bilateral relations were discussed with a 
      number of       countries in the West European region during 1987. There 
      were several exchanges       of delegations and visits of Ministers and 
      Prime Ministers. The Prime Minister of    Norway visited India in July 
      1987 to discuss bilateral and international issues    .    He attended 
      the Conference of the World Commission on Environment and    Development. 
      During the visit a Memorandum of Understanding on Economic,    Industrial 
      and Technological Cooperation was signed. Our Prime Minister met    the 
      Dutch Prime Minister during a transit visit to the Netherlands in October 
            1987. <br><br>During the Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit 
      to Sweden for the Six    Nation Initiative in January 1988, discussions 
      were held with his Swedish    counterpart on international issues and 
      matters of mutual bilateral interest.          The Italian Prime 
      Minister, Mr. Giovanni Goria, paid an official visit to    India in 
      January 1988, the first ever official visit by an Italian Prime Minist 
         er.    During discussions at the levels of the two Prime Ministers 
      and delegations, vi    ews    were exchanged on international issues and 
      matters of mutual bilateral interest    .    Three important agreements 
      were signed : a Memorandum of Understanding providing for Italian credit 
      of US $ 250 million in the Energy sector, a Memo-       randum of 
      Understanding on Development Project for Maintenance Centre at    the 
      Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, and a Memorandum of Understand-

      with the USSR and the    other socialist countries of Eastern Europe 
      continued to grow and strengthen.       Exchange of visit at the highest 
      level contributed in a large measure to this       process; 
      simultaneously the decisions of the meetings of India's Joint Com- 
         missions with many of the countries, to increase substantially 
      bilateral trade turnover, accelerate technology transfer, increase 
      scientific cooperation, gave    a    yet greater substance to India's 
      relations with these countries.       The Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv 
      Gandhi's visit to the USSR in July 1987 and       the visit by the 
      Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, Mr. N. I. Ryzhkov       to 
      India in November 1987 continued the process of dialogue between the two 
         countries at- the highest level. During his visit, the Prime Minister, 
      Shri Raj    iv    Gandhi inaugurated the year-long Festival of India in 
      the USSR. He also had    meetings with the Soviet General Secretary, Mr. 
      M. S. Gorbachev and the Soviet       Prime Minister, Mr. N. I. Ryzhkov. 
      These discussions were continued during    the Soviet Premier's visit to 
      India in connection with the inauguration of the       Festival of the 
      USSR in India. The discussions revealed an identity or a close 
            similarity of views between the two countries on bilateral,
