1950	review of the expenditure of the Ministry of External Affairs. The total expenditure in 1950-51, according to the revised estimates, is expected to amount to Rs. 597 lakhs. Included within this amount are certain items of expenditure which are fixed in nature or have little relation to the normal activities of the Ministry. These are:(1) Tribal Areas including the Assam Rifles-Rs. 150 lakhs; (2) Subsidies to neighbouring States and administration of Chandernagore-about Rs. 25 lakhs; (3) Contributions to the United Nations and delegations thereto-Rs. 74 lakhs; (4) Expenditure on demarcation of boundary between India and Pakistan, Recovery of abducted women and implementation of P.M.'s agreement-Rs. 21 lakhs; (5) Passports and Emigration Establishment-Rs. 5 lakhs: (6) Political pensions and cost of repatriation of IndiansRs. 3 lakhs. It will thus appear that the actual expenditure on the normal work of this Ministry is much less than what appears at first sight. If the expenditure on the special items enumerated above (totalling Rs. 278 lakhs) is excluded, the expenditure on items, strictly pertaining to this Ministry, works out to Rs. 319 lakhs. This includes an expenditure of Rs. 48 lakhs on our biggest Mission, viz. the High Commissioner's Office in London, and Rs. 54 lakhs on account of the pay and allowances of officers and staff and other expenses at the headquarters of the Ministry.
