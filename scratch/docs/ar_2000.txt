Annual Report 2000-2001

Introduction and Synopsis

D

uring the year 2000-01, several initiatives of the previous two
years reached fruition and India consolidated further its
relationship with the major powers and other friends and partners
underscoring its position as a factor of peace, stability, security and
balance not only in Asia but on a much wider canvas in the world. The
first ever Indo-EU Summit and the inauguration of the Ganga-Mekong
Cooperation Project launched new avenues of engagement with countries
of these two regions whilst, at the same time, reflecting the level of
maturity that had been reached in relations with them. The visit of
President, Shri K.R. Narayanan, to China as well as the visits to India of
the Prime Minister of Nepal, the President of Sri Lanka as well as those
of the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples
Congress of China and the Deputy Chairman of the State Peace and
Development Council of Myanmar further strengthened Indias bilateral
relations with neighbouring countries which are of historical,
civilisational and geopolitical significance. In addressing the Millennium
Summit at the United Nations, Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpyaee, spelt out Indias vision of a new multi-polar order. His visit
to the United States reflected a hitherto unprecedented degree of
engagement between the worlds two great democracies, putting into
practice the dialogue architecture drawn up by them. Fresh impetus
was imparted to the traditional close and mutually-reinforcing strategic
ties with Russia with the Russian Presidents visit to India. Visits to
India by the Prime Ministers of Australia and Japan, the King of Morocco,
the President of Algeria, the President of Colombia and the Prime

Minister of Mauritius were telling examples of the global reach of Indias
diplomatic engagement. In furthering the objectives of the U.N. Charter,
India led the international communitys effort to restore democracy
and constitutionality in Fiji and contributed to U.N. peace-keeping
efforts in Sierra Leone and the Horn of Africa. The global trend towards
democratisation drew sustenance from the success of democratic
governance in a country of one billion people; at the same time,
democracys antithesis, international terrorism was decisively condemned
and rejected by the international community. The strength and resilience
of Indias economy and science & technology made it an attractive partner
in trade and investment and in international cooperation in knowledgebased and cutting edge industries. Indias cultural diversity and
international programmes contributed to the enrichment of mankinds
reservoir in this field.
Certain essential priorities and objectives that inform Indias foreign
policy can broadly be encapsulated as follows:
r To safeguard Indias territorial integrity and sovereignty, enhance
Indias strategic space and preserve the autonomy of our decisionmaking processes.
r To strengthen further Indias role as a factor of peace, stability,
security and balance in Asia and in the world.
r To win international understanding and support for Indias national
interests, priorities, aspirations and concerns and, wherever possible,
to develop international synergies in furthering common objectives.

To create such conditions in the Indian sub-continent and in our
immediate neighbourhood as would enable India to devote its
resources and attention to developmental and infrastructural
activities.
To strengthen peace and stability in the region and further enhance
friendship, cooperation and mutually beneficial inter-dependencies
with our neighbours. In enhancing the constituency of peace in the
Indian sub-continent, India would cooperate actively with likeminded countries to isolate and defeat negative phenomena of
extremism, obscurantism and terrorism.
To strengthen the trends of cooperation, friendship and trust with
countries of Indias extended neighbourhood based on old
civilisational and historical ties as well as strong contemporary
relevance. Countries of South-East Asia, the Gulf and the Indian
Ocean region have a common stake with India in promoting peace,
stability and development in this space.
To work with the P-5 countries and other major powers to promote
bilateral relations and to work towards strengthening peace, stability
and multi-polarity in the world based on the new architecture of
dialogue and cooperation established with them.
To promote the cause of democracy and individual freedom to
unleash the creative genius of peoples in all countries and to promote
greater realisation that democratic governance and systems are
essential ingredients of international peace and stability.
To promote civilisational tolerance and interaction in the world
and to preserve the unique cultural heritage of mankind in all its
diversity and splendour through common action and international
programmes.
To work constructively with other countries in multilateral
institutions and international organisations such as the U.N., NAM,
ARF, IOR-ARC, etc. to generate international common approaches
to contemporary challenges.
To give greater focus and priority to economic diplomacy with the
objective of promoting foreign trade and investments, ensuring
equitable transfer of technology and strengthening our general
economic and commercial links with the rest of the world. The size
and positive trends of Indias economy give us the potential of playing
a leading role in shaping the international economic order and pace
of development.

With Bangladesh, the high-level interaction included the areas of
water resources, trade and defence. The 34 th Joint Rivers Commission
met in January 2001 to review all areas of cooperation in sharing of
waters. Preparatory work for this meeting had taken place through
important bilateral visits from both sides. In December 2000, the Foreign
Office consultations led to agreement on expediting the introduction of
the Agartala-Dhaka bus service, review of measures to enhance
commercial interaction, liberalisation of visa arrangements and a sharing
of concerns on the growth of terrorism in the region. The Agreement
concerning the Demarcation of the Land Boundary between India and
Bangladesh and Related Matters was also discussed and two Working
Groups were set up to address the pending issues. Border Management
and security issues were also taken up at the Home Secretary level and
through the interaction between the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles.
Several agreements were reached to increase the communication links
between the two countries both by road and rail, as evidenced in the
inauguration of a third broad gauge rail link for freight, in January 2001.
Similarly, active cooperation characterised the areas of education and
technical training, with many Bangladeshi students pursuing their studies
in India.
India consistently reiterated its commitment to the unity, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, and to a peaceful, political process
as being the only means of achieving a lasting peace, through a negotiated
settlement, which would meet the aspirations of all elements of Sri
Lankan society. The high-level contact between the two neighbours
continued with the President of Sri Lanka visiting India in February
2001. The broad-ranging talks with Indian leaders were reflective of the
high priority attached by both countries to the maintenance of close
and friendly relations based on mutual trust and understanding. Earlier,
in June 2000, the External Affairs Minister had visited Sri Lanka to study
the evolving situation and had expressed Indias willingness to extend to
Sri Lanka a line of credit of US $ 100 million on mutually acceptable
terms. The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister had also visited India in
December 2000. There were a series of initiatives to address the problems
faced by fishermen from both the countries. There was also considerable
movement on publicizing the benefits from the India-Sri Lanka Free
Trade Agreement, which was operationalised on March 1, 2000. Cultural
interaction flourished through the activities of the India Culture Centre
in Colombo and the India-Sri Lanka Foundation.

Annual Report 2000-2001

The close, friendly and problem-free relations between India and
Maldives were given added warmth with exchanges of high-level visits,
including the State visit of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of
Maldives in August 2000. Earlier, in March 2000, the Foreign Minister
of Maldives had attended the Fourth Session of the India-Maldives Joint
Commission in New Delhi. Raksha Mantri visited Maldives from
January 9-12, 2001 and held detailed discussions. There was also
productive interaction and Joint Exercises between the two Coast Guards.
Parliamentary and educational exchanges also remained active.
Constructive engagement with Myanmar focused on broad-basing
the areas of cooperation and restoring the tradition of high-level bilateral
exchanges between the two countries. Gen. Maung Aye, Vice Chairman
of the State Peace and Development Council led a high-level delegation
to India in November 2000, and had wide-ranging discussions covering
economic cooperation, trade, cross-border projects and activities,
international terrorism, drug trafficking, cooperation in the field of
culture, human resource development, science and technology and
regional cooperation within the framework of BIMST-EC and the IndiaASEAN Dialogue partnership. The two sides agreed to take steps to
ensure peace and tranquillity along the India-Myanmar border. Minister
of External Affairs visited Myanmar in February 2001 and inaugurated
the Tamu-Kalemyo-Kalewa highway, which is expected to enhance
economic relations between the two countries. The EAM also held talks
with the Myanmar leaders on all areas of mutual interest. The first
meeting of the India-Myanmar Joint Working Group on Science and
Technology was held in April 2000 (in Yangon). There were also highlevel military visits to Myanmar and the visit to India by the Myanmar
Home Minister in November 2000. Regular institutional dialogue on
border management-related matters was maintained. Cultural contacts
were also active with the Myanmar Culture Minister visiting India in
January-February 2000 and the signing of the India-Myanmar Cultural
Agreement.
In its immediate neighbourhood, India continued to build on
historical commonalities. On the north, Indo-Nepali relations were close
and friendly with extensive social and people-to-people contacts. From
31 July to 6 August 2000, the Prime Minister of Nepal, Shri Girija Prasad
Koirala was on a goodwill visit to India. Several agreements were worked
out to ensure better cooperation, with focus on better border
management and the development of border districts. Cooperation in

the area of security was sought to be enhanced through the Home
Secretary level talks in July 2000. There was an understanding that neither
country would permit its territory to be used for activities prejudicial
to the other. A Joint Committee on Water Resources was constituted.
As in past years, India continued to be involved in several development
projects in Nepal.
Relations between India and Bhutan are characterised by mutual
trust, understanding and close friendship. Economic cooperation between
the two countries has been steadily growing and continues to provide a
firm foundation to the expanding bilateral relationship. As part of the
close bilateral cooperation, India has been extending financial assistance
to Bhutan by supporting its Five Year Plans since 1961  the level of
assistance for the 8 th Five Year Plan was approved at Rs. 900 crores. The
projects proposed to be financed by Indian assistance cover diverse areas
in the fields of hydroelectricity generation and transmission, roads,
bridges and social infrastructure. The Bhutanese Foreign Minister paid
a goodwill visit to India in April 2000. The visit allowed an across-theboard review of relations on all fronts. Several high-ranking Indian
officials, including the Foreign Secretary, also visited Bhutan.
As in the past, India remained committed to establishing a
relationship of peace, friendship and cooperation with Pakistan. India
called on Pakistan to abandon its compulsive hostility and adhere to the
Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration. Pakistan, however,
continued its support to the infiltration in Kashmir and kept up the
shrill anti-India tirade in international fora. There was, in fact, an ominous
upgrading in the quality of weapons and training being supplied to the
terrorist groups by Pakistan. Pakistan also persistently sought to sabotage
any prospect for peace in Jammu and Kashmir, whenever initiatives
were taken in this regard. The international community also took notice
of the Pakistani practice of using cross-border terrorism as an instrument
of state policy, in the past year.
The Samjhauta Express and the Delhi-Lahore Bus Service ensured
that people across the borders were able to maintain contacts with
relatives or travel for business and pilgrimage purposes. Regular hotline
contact was maintained between the Director Generals of Military
Operations (DGMO) of the two countries, and the paramilitary forces
in charge of managing the sensitive border met periodically to sort out
day-to-day issues.

Introduction and Synopsis

The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan continued to be a matter of
deep concern for India. India remained firm in its belief that there can
be no military solution to the Afghan problem and that Afghanistans
independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity must be
preserved. One of the Indian initiatives in this regard is the process of
institutionalised dialogue with the US on the subject of Afghanistan.
There was a similar coordination of efforts with Russia through the
formation of a Joint Working Group.
There was an expansion of cordial and multi-faceted ties with Iran
over the year. The 11 th meeting of the Indo-Iran Joint Commission in
May 2000 was attended by the External Affairs Minister. Among other
areas of bilateral cooperation, there were important initiatives regarding
the transmission of Iranian natural gas to India. It was also decided to set
up an Indian Cultural Centre in Tehran. In July 2000, the Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister visited India and discussed all outstanding issues,
especially the situation in Afghanistan.
This year also saw an intensification of Indias engagement with the
countries of South-East Asia. This is as much an acknowledgement of
the impressive economic performance of this part of the world as also a
demonstration of Indias desire to develop a multifaceted partnership
with the region. This commonality of interests saw India draw
progressively closer to these countries  individually and with ASEAN
 over the past year.
After a brief lull in the wake of Pokhran II, there has been a renewal
of friendly relations with Australia and New Zealand. The visit of the
Australian PM in July 2000 was an eloquent assertion that the two
countries are keen to weave a more intricate tapestry of interaction.
Resumption of defence ties also got underway. New Zealand and India
saw a strengthening of economic relations with trade growing in both
directions. As dominant countries of the region, Australia and New
Zealand were important interlocutors during the hostage crisis in Fiji.
India was appreciative of the support that Cambodia expressed over
the past year for Indias claim for a permanent membership of the UN
Security Council. The cooperation is expected to gain further substance
after the Mekong-Ganga programme deliberations in Vientiane
(November 2000).
The year saw considerable consternation due to the civilian coup in
Fiji. As the rebels held several dignitaries (including Prime Minister

iv
172

Choudhary) captive, India was deeply concerned about the safety of the
hostages as well as the large Indian community in Fiji. Consultations
were held with Australia and New Zealand on the issue, and PM
Choudhary also visited India after his release to confer with the top
political leadership. India continues to be worried by this unfortunate
recidivism of racial politics in Fiji. India supports the return to the nondiscriminatory 1997 constitution and hopes to see the early establishment
of pluralistic and multi-racial norms, where the Indian community shall
enjoy its legitimate rights.
The cordial ties between India and Laos were further cemented in
November this year, when the External Affairs Minister visited Laos
for the inaugural Ministerial meeting of the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation.
The Third Indo-Laos Joint Commission Meeting was also held during
the visit, in which important agreements were signed in the areas of
trade, investment and agricultural cooperation.
Indian ties with Vietnam were given further impetus by the visit of
the Indian Prime Minister in January 2001. A Joint Business Council
meeting was held in Hanoi during this visit and agreements were signed
in the areas of Tourism and Nuclear Energy. Vietnam also extended
support to Indias candidature for permanent membership of the UNSC.
Earlier, in November 2000, the Minister for External Affairs had visited
Vietnam for the 10 th session of the Joint Commission for Economic,
Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
Bilateral relations with Indonesia were further strengthened this year
with the visit of the Indian Prime Minister in January 2001. There was
a Joint Business Council meeting in Jakarta and important agreements
in the areas of defence, Science and Technology, Agriculture and Culture
were signed. The Prime Minister reiterated Indias support for the
territorial integrity of Indonesia, while the Indonesian side voiced support
for Indias candidature for the UNSC.
There was fruitful exchange with Malaysia over the year and October
2000 saw the convening of the Second session of the Indo-Malaysian
Joint Commission. The session comprehensively examined the avenues
for further strengthening relations, resulting in agreements on Trade
and Cultural Exchange. From July 2000, Malaysia is also the country
coordinator for Indias interaction with the ASEAN.
Relations remained cordial with Thailand. Economic, Commercial
and Cultural links were strengthened through the exchange of high level

Annual Report 2000-2001

visits. Indias membership in the BIMST-EC has given further impetus
to this cooperation and the launching of the Mekong-Ganga initiative is
likely to add to it. The year saw a handsome growth in bilateral trade.
There were a series of important visits to and from Singapore during
the year. The External Affairs Minister visited Singapore in June 2000
and President of India Honble Shri K. R. Narayanan paid a State Visit
in November 2000. Commercial interaction increased with the signing
of MOUs in Information Technology and the Economic Field.
Relations remained similarly cordial and cooperative with the other
countries of South-East Asia. With the Pacific Island countries, Indias
engagement was low in quantitative terms but excellent qualitatively.
As India and China celebrated a half-century since the establishment
of diplomatic relations, there was an implicit mutual recognition of the
important role the two most populous countries have to play in the
next century. For this, both India and China showed willingness to
enhance a feeling of mutual trust and confidence. They agreed that the
Joint Working Group and the Expert Group form an effective
institutional mechanism for ironing out the differences on the boundary
issue. They also stressed the common interest they have in fostering
stability in Asia as a whole and recognised that bilateral talks are the
best instrument to resolve all outstanding disputes between nations.
After a gap of eight years, there was a visit by the Indian President
to China in May-June 2000. Besides the commitment to enhance official
level cooperation, the two sides formed an Eminent Persons Group.
From the Chinese side, there was first the visit of the Foreign Minister
in July 2000. This led to an agreement to expedite the process of
clarification of the boundary. At the beginning of the New Year,
Chairman Li Peng of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples
Congress visited India. He stressed that China did not see India as a
threat and desired good neighbourly relations between the two countries.
The Joint Working Group on the Boundary Question met for the twelfth
time and the sides agreed on a mutual exchange of maps. Besides the
border issue, the two countries also talked on the entire spectrum of
issues of mutual concern. Interaction at all levels  both official and
non-official  remained high throughout the year. There were a series of
important ministerial level visits and a resumption of exchanges between
the armed forces. Indo-Chinese trade also recorded a healthy growth.
Traditional cultural links and strong economic ties make Indo-Japan

relations robust and abiding. These natural affinities were further
augmented when the Prime Minister of Japan visited India in August
2000. Several important initiatives were agreed upon to enrich the
bilateral relationship and to tap the potential of this partnership in the
new areas of Information Technology. There were important Ministerial
visits from the Indian side too, including the visit of the Raksha Mantri
in June 2000, which allowed a productive discussion on a bilateral security
dialogue. Economically, trade flows remained buoyant and had amounted
to about 1987 million dollars in the first half of the financial year itself.
India and Mongolia celebrated 45 years of cordial and multifaceted
diplomatic relations with the State Visit of the Mongolian President in
January 2001. Mongolia voiced its support for Indias claim for a
permanent membership of the UN Security Council. It further echoed
Indias call for a multilateral effort against state-sponsored and crossborder terrorism.
The economic interaction with the Republic of Korea has been on
an upswing ever since the liberalisation drive in India. This was
strengthened with the visit of the ROK Foreign Affairs and Trade
Minister in July-August 2000. India extended its support to the
reconciliation process currently underway in the Korean peninsula. In
November 2000, an MoU was signed between the two countries for
cooperation in the area of Information Technology. Relations with the
Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea also remained friendly. The visit
of the DPRK Vice Foreign Minister enabled consultations between the
Foreign Offices. There was also significant interaction on the cultural
front, with a number of artistic performances and film festivals being
organised.
The Central Asian Region and India have always had civilisational
links, with economic, commercial and cultural links going back to
centuries. With the emergence of Central Asian countries as independent
nations, the discovery of fossil fuel reserves in them and the emergence
of international and cross-border terrorism as problems common to India
and them, it has become all the more necessary for India to engage them.
On its part, India is in a position to provide useful technical expertise to
aid the development effort of these nations. All this has resulted in a
concerted effort to renew past connections and strengthen relations on
all fronts during the year.
The new mission in Baku has given India a functional presence in
173v

Introduction and Synopsis

Azerbaijan and has been actively pursuing Indian interests and
disseminating information. Relations with Kazakhstan have been cordial
and gained in substance with the active Indian participation in the Kazakh
initiated Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures
in Asia. Economic cooperation has also been on an upward trend.
Contacts with Kyrgyzstan were maintained in all areas  political,
commercial and cultural. They were substantiated by the important visit
by the Head of the Kyrgyz Foreign Policy Department.
India shares several regional security concerns with Tajikistan, which
benefited from extensive consultations between the two Foreign Offices.
Similar concerns were shared with Turkmenistan when the Turkmen
Foreign Minister visited India in April 2000. There was also a
commitment to expand economic ties. The 500 th birth anniversary of
Bairam Khan  a memorable medieval figure  provided the two countries
an opportunity to look back upon a common historical and cultural
heritage.
During the year, relations with Turkey were active with a series of
high level visits that gave greater content to the bilateral ties. This was
reflected in the highly successful State Visit of the Prime Minister of
Turkey in March-April 2000. Significant agreements leading to
cooperation in the political, agricultural and cultural fields were signed.
Economic cooperation is also seen as an area of promise, especially in
the area of infrastructure development.
May 2000 saw the visit of the Uzbek President to India and provided
an opportunity to the two countries to review common concerns on
the issue of international terrorism and the rise of religious intolerance
in the world. A number of promising agreements were signed.
India remained attentive to the developments in West Asia and North
Africa. The Gulf countries of the region house a large number of Indian
expatriate workers and are the principal source of Indias energy supplies.
India also continued to monitor the protracted and tortuous progress of
the Middle East Peace Process.
The 14th Session of the India-Iraq Joint Commission took place in
Delhi in November 2000 and was followed by the visit of the Iraqi Vice
President. There were important meetings with representatives of the
Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry, and India increased the ITEC slots
for Iraq. Earlier in the year, the Minister of State for External Affairs,
Shri Ajit Kumar Panja had visited Iraq to facilitate closer ties between
the two countries.

vi
174

Relations with Kuwait retained their traditional warmth with an
important visit by the Union Minister for Human Resource
Development and goodwill visits by two Indian Naval ships to Kuwait.
The Minister of State for External Affairs also visited Kuwait in July
2000 and held meetings with important dignitaries.
The Third Session of the India-Oman Joint Commission was held
in April 2000. Omans Minister Responsible for Foreign Affairs visited
India in July 2000. An Indo-Oman Strategic Consultative Group was
planned and there were productive discussions on the IOR-ARC
initiative.
The traditionally friendly relations between India and Bahrain were
strengthened and diversified over the year. The Bahraini Minister of
Transportation visited India in April 2000.
India and Qatar continued a productive relationship, with useful
collaboration in the area of Natural Gas trading. This was facilitated by
the visit of the Minister of Energy, Industry, Electricity and Water of
Qatar in October 2000.
Cordiality also marked relations with Yemen with the renewing of
the Joint Business Council Agreement in May 2000.
Indias important relationship with Saudi Arabia was further
enriched this year. The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas visited
Saudi Arabia in November 2000 to attend the International Energy
Forum. There was a productive trade fair featuring Indian goods held in
September 2000. The one and a half million strong Indian workforce
continued to be the largest expatriate community in Saudi Arabia and
underlined the importance of close engagement between the two
countries. Over a lakh pilgrims also made the Haj journey from India,
which necessitated extensive preparatory logistical coordination between
the two countries. In January 2001, the Honble External Affairs Minister
paid the first ever visit at this level to Saudi Arabia.
There were a spate of important visits between India and the United
Arab Emirates, which helped to cement traditionally close ties. April
2000 saw the visit of the UAE Minister of Information and Culture
while the Chairman of Emirates Airlines was in India in September
2000. The Instruments of Ratification of the Treaty on Extradition and
Mutual Legal Assistance were exchanged in May 2000. The Indian
Minister for Commerce and Industry presided over a meeting of
Commercial Representatives, at Dubai in June 2000. A Confederation

Annual Report 2000-2001

of Indian Industry (CII) delegation that visited UAE in May 2000 gave
further momentum to this significant economic partnership.
Traditional relations with Egypt progressed well over the year. The
G-15 Summit was held in Cairo in June 2000 and was attended by the
Vice President of India. The Minister of State for Commerce and Industry
inaugurated the INDIATECH exhibition, in September 2000.
The Foreign Minister of Jordan visited India in December 2000.
The consultations covered all areas of bilateral cooperation as well as
the situation in the Middle East. Economic cooperation also grew,
especially in the area of textiles, with a successful exhibition in October
2000.
Indias traditional support for the territorial integrity of Lebanon
provided a firm basis for continued friendship and trust between the
two countries.
Relations also remained cordial with Libya, with increasing emphasis
on economic interaction. The July 2000 visit of the Foreign Minister of
Libya provided an opportunity to reiterate this sense of friendship.
India continued to extend political, moral and material support to
Palestine. India conveyed its concern at the stalling of the Middle East
Peace Process and maintained that a just, lasting and comprehensive
peace in the region can only be established on the basis of UNSC
resolutions 242 and 338. President Yassir Arafat visited Delhi in August
2000. There were several important visits from the Indian side too,
including those of the Home Minister and the Minister for External
Affairs.
Over the year, bilateral ties of friendship, mutual understanding
and cooperation with Israel were strengthened. The visit of the Home
Minister in June 2000 led to a Working Group on counter-terrorism.
Later, the External Affairs Minister also visited Israel and put the bilateral
dialogue on a firm footing by agreeing on a Ministerial level Joint
Commission. Israels Minister for Regional Cooperation made two trips
to India over the course of the year to foster closer economic ties and to
keep India informed about the Middle East Peace Process.
Bilateral cooperation with Sudan was given a fillip by the visit of
the Minister of State for External Affairs in April 2000. He co-chaired
the second meeting of the Indo-Sudan Joint Commission, which led to
agreements in a wide variety of areas.
India mourned with Syria the loss of Late President Hafez al Assad

this year. The Minister of Human Resource Development and Science
and Technology represented India at the funeral. Among other important
visits, a high-level delegation visited New Delhi in July 2000 for the
fourth session of the Joint Trade Committee.
Minister of State for External Affairs was in Tunis to co-chair the
first Meeting of the Indo-Tunisian Joint Commission in April 2000.
The Foreign Minister of Tunisia visited India in December 2000 and
had a series of useful talks.
Relations were similarly cordial and forward looking with Morocco,
with cooperation increasing in a variety of areas, to the mutual benefit
of both countries.
In June 2000, the Indo-Algerian Joint Commission met in Algeria.
Later, the October 2000 visit of the External Affairs Minister helped
draw the two countries closer. As a culmination of this process, the
President of Algeria visited India in January 2001 and was the Chief
Guest at the Republic Day Parade.
A changing Africa has provided new areas for cooperation and
interaction for the mutual benefit of both India and Africa. This allowed
a progressive strengthening of relations in the year. There were important
visits by the Foreign Minister of Benin, a large business delegation from
Botswana and Parliamentary delegations from Cameroon, Madagascar
and Kenya. The war between Eritrea and Ethiopia did not prevent India
from drawing closer to both the countries or providing them assistance
in their fight against a terrible drought. Assistance was also extended to
Mozambique when it faced the fury of floodwaters and cyclone. The
first non-socialist government of Senegal showed its keenness to
strengthen commercial relations with India. Cooperation also increased
with Seychelles after the 5 th Joint Commission Meeting in October 2000;
in the educational field, the visit of the Seychelles Minister for Education
gave a fillip to collaboration. Relations also remained cordial with
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.
With Mauritius, relations continued on an upswing, on the defence,
economic and education fronts. This special friendship has endured after
the new coalition government headed by Sir Anerood Jagnauth took
office. The Foreign Minister of Mauritius visited India in January 2001
and Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth paid a visit later in the same
month.
Already Indias largest trading partner in Africa, Nigeria signed a
175
vii

Introduction and Synopsis

further agreement on the petroleum sector with India. In a gratifying
acknowledgement of Indias democratic institutions, Nigeria decided to
train 360 members of its National Assembly in the Lok Sabha Secretariat.
The Honourable Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Shri
Omar Abdullah, paid a productive visit to Nigeria in October 2000.
In Sierra Leone, India participated in the multi-nation force that
sought to control the spiralling violence. The year saw some tension as
some Indian soldiers were first captured by the rebels and then brilliantly
rescued. From September 2000, India started withdrawing its forces from
this operation in a phased manner.
Due to its economic strength and status as a founding member of
the IOR-ARC, South Africa remains one of the most important countries
in the region from the Indian perspective. The past year saw trade
continue to grow at a healthy pace and defence cooperation was
stimulated by the visit of the Raksha Mantri in September 2000.
India continued to have cordial and mutually beneficial relations
with the European continent. With the easing of cold war tensions, and
the adoption of similar politico-economic regimes in both Eastern and
Western Europe, there is today a wide appreciation of the liberal
democratic norms of the Indian nation. This is further tinged with respect
for Indias economic potential as a likely powerhouse of the new century.
Most European nations share Indias perspective on the dangers posed
by international terrorism and realise the validity of Indias claim for
permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council.
This mood was in evidence in the first-ever India-EU summit in
June 2000, which was attended by an Indian delegation headed by the
Prime Minister. India and the EU aimed to build a strategic partnership
with active cooperation in the political, economic and commercial fields.
India continued to monitor with interest the proposed expansion plans
of the European Union and the suggested changes in its working to
include common foreign and security policy issues. The EC External
Relations Commissioner paid an official visit to India in January 2001.
A forum of non-official eminent personalities, the India-EU Round Table,
was launched. A Joint Working Group on Terrorism has also been agreed
on.
India also continued to participate actively in all the forums under
the Commonwealth umbrella, with the External Affairs Minister leading
the Indian delegation to the Summit Meeting of the Commonwealth

viii
176

High Level Group in September 2000 at New York. Earlier in April,
the Commonwealth Secretary General visited India.
The close relationship between India and France was celebrated in
April 2000 by the State Visit of the Indian President. The two countries
reiterated the vitality of a strategic partnership and put into effect
important agreements on promoting bilateral investment. Economic
ties were further strengthened by the visit of the Commerce and Industry
Minister for the session of the Indo-French Joint Committee on
Economic Cooperation. Joint Working Groups were planned to
concentrate on the high potential sectors. The Home Minister also visited
France to explore the modalities of closer interaction on battling
terrorism. Defence and Security cooperation continued under the aegis
of the Joint High Committee on Defence Cooperation and through the
bilateral strategic dialogue, the sixth round of which was held in JanuaryFebruary 2001. It received impetus with the visit of the French Defence
Minister in May 2000.
Indias history binds it to a warm and advantageous partnership
with the United Kingdom. The time-honoured friendship benefits from
a functional institutional structure for cooperation on all fronts. UK
was sympathetic to Indias claim for a permanent place on an expanded
UNSC. The determined intent of both countries to increase bilateral
trade led to a one-third rise in the commercial traffic in the first half of
year 2000. Over the past year, India and UK have recognised international
terrorism, drug and arms trading and the rise of religious intolerance as
issues of mutual concern that require close coordination at the political
and official levels. The first meeting of the Joint Working Group on
Terrorism and Drug Trafficking was held in January 2001. There was
an important visit by UKs Foreign Secretary in April 2000. India and
UK stressed the importance of this partnership to both countries and
inaugurated India-UK Round Table as a constructive forum for
cooperation. The External Affairs Minister visited the UK in May 2000
and again in November. Other important bilateral visits were by the
British Secretary of State for Defence in December 2000 and the British
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in January 2001. Parliamentary
and Non-Governmental exchanges were also actively pursued.
Germany remains an important economic partner for India and,
given its importance in the European Community, India considers it a
key interlocutor on several global issues. The year saw the resumption

Annual Report 2000-2001

of German development assistance as well as the establishment of a
Strategic Dialogue process. The gamut of bilateral relations was reviewed
when the Deputy Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Germany visited
India in May 2000 and again in September. This led to the adoption of a
forward-looking vision statement between the two countries. Early in
2001, the External Affairs Minister visited Berlin to inaugurate the new
Indian Embassy premises. Economic relations remained important and
received further impetus with the Finance Ministers visit to Germany
in April 2000. In the past year, Germany also expressed its willingness
to tap the vast skilled manpower pool India enjoys in the area of
Information Technology.
Prime Minister visited Italy in June 2000 and the resultant dialogue
has led to closer cooperation in all areas especially on the fronts of
combating international terrorism and promoting tourism. Among other
important exchanges was the visit of the Italian Foreign Minister to
India in November 2000.
There was a similar forward movement in relations with the other
Western European countries, with a widely shared sense of concern at
the scourge of terrorism and an appreciation of the potential advantages
of closer ties with the emergent Indian economy, especially in the area
of Information Technology.
With the countries of Eastern Europe, India has enjoyed close and
friendly relations for many years. There has been fairly active interaction
in the area of culture and science and technology. However, of late, the
economic facet of this relationship is also being pursued with equal
enthusiasm.
As the successor state to the Soviet Union, Russia continues to have
a special place in Indian foreign policy. The past year was marked by
the State Visit of the newly elected Russian President in October 2000.
During the visit, agreements covering all possible areas of bilateral
cooperation were signed. The two countries envisioned a productive
Strategic Partnership for the next century. Russia extended support
for the Indian position on resolving the Kashmir dispute through bilateral
talks, and also agreed that India was an obvious contender for a permanent
place in the UNSC. Besides the Presidential visit, there were a number
of opportunities for interaction at the highest level including the External
Affairs Ministers trip in June 2000.
Relations moved visibly forward with the other East European

countries. There were a series of cordial exchanges and visits  the Foreign
Minister of Armenia, the Defence Minister of Bulgaria, the Deputy Prime
Minister of Croatia, the Foreign Minister of Georgia, the Deputy Prime
Minister of Poland and the Defence Minister of Romania were only
some of the important dignitaries to visit India from this region during
the year. The countries were virtually unanimous in their support to
Indian positions  on terrorism, on the reform of the United Nations or
on the importance of democracy.
Among the more important trends noticed over the year was the
marked enhancement in Indias engagement with the United States of
America. The year was, in fact, something of a watershed in Indo-US
relations as these two natural partners stepped into an entirely new
phase of broad and multifaceted affiliation. The underlying identity of
values in the two countries  democracy and individual freedom  served
to unite them towards a common world vision. Of late, the growing
economic interaction between India and the US has also become a major
driving force towards mutually beneficial strengthening of relations. The
most visible signal of this growing economic interdependence is, of
course, the vital role being played by the highly successful Indian
community in the US.
The two sides celebrated this growing intimacy in the grandest
manner possible  by an exchange of State visits in the same year. The
March 2000 visit of the US President led to the drawing up of a vision
statement, which outlined the commonalities in the way both countries
look towards the new century. An institutionalised mechanism for
regular exchange of views on all matters of interest has also evolved.
This involves periodic dialogue at the Summit level as well as at other
political and official levels. The proposed dialogue would cover the entire
spectrum of issues of mutual concern, including UN peacekeeping and
the situation in Afghanistan.
In September 2000, the Prime Minister visited the US and became
the only foreign leader to address the Joint Sitting of the 106 th Congress.
There were also a host of other important banquets, receptions and
meetings with the top political and official figures besides thinkers and
representatives of the Indian community. The visit provided a further
catalyst to the process of progressive engagement.
Both countries recognise that the forces of democracy have come to
hold centre stage in the entire world today, and, as established and vibrant
democracies, both India and the US wish to stand behind these forces.

Introduction and Synopsis

They also agree on the dangers posed to civil society as a whole, and to
democracy in particular, by the emergence of global and state sponsored
terrorism. These dangers can be effectively challenged only if the two
great democracies put up a joint front against them. India and the US
also stressed the importance of strategic stability in Asia and recognised
that this can by best ensured through the efforts of the relevant states
themselves.
With Canada, there was productive interaction on the front of
terrorism. The Joint Working Group on Terrorism had met in February
2000, which allowed an interchange of information on terrorist groups.
The Indian Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas led a delegation for
the 16 th World Petroleum Congress held at Calgary, Canada in June
2000.
India has always had the best of relations with the Latin American
and Caribbean countries. On a variety of issues confronting the world,
India and the countries of this region have find themselves on one side 
besides, of course, the close interaction in the portals of the Non-Aligned
Movement. There is also considerable respect and knowledge about
Indian culture in the area. There is a realisation, however, that the
economic potential of the relationship has never been fully exploited,
leading to a series of attempts to correct this. There was a step up in the
participation of Export Promotion Councils and business houses in trade
exhibitions in Latin America. This has allowed a better appreciation of
each others economic strengths and comparative advantages, and is
expected to lead to a burgeoning of trade flows over the near future.
India is making a concerted effort to fashion a working institutional
relationship with MERCOSUR as part of this pursuit. There were a
number of important bilateral visits in the course of the year including
the visit of the Minister of State for External Affairs to Argentina and
Trinidad & Tobago in August 2000. The Minister of State for Commerce
and Industry also made a valuable trip to the region, helping to set up
the framework for a productive economic interaction. New ground was
broken with some countries in the region as first ever Foreign Office
Level consultations began with Peru and Uruguay.
Earlier in the year, the External Affairs Minister visited Cartagena,
Colombia for the Ministerial Conference of the NAM Foreign Ministers
in April 2000. In the same month, the Minister for Human Resource
Development led the Indian delegation for the G-77 South Summit in
Havana.

In Indias opinion, the United Nations, due to its inclusive nature,
is the appropriate platform for resolving most global issues. However,
India believes that the world body needs necessary reform so that it can
legitimately speak for the entire planet. This led India to actively
participate in all the UN forums and strongly advocate the kind of
restructuring that is required. The most significant event under the UN
aegis was the Millennium Summit in September 2000. The Prime Minister
addressed the Summit and outlined Indias stand on a variety of issues
facing the UN and the world today. Indias call for refocusing and
restructuring of the UN found echo in the representations of most other
countries. Many countries also agreed that given Indias size, its
unblemished democratic record, its economic promise and its
contributions to UN peacekeeping efforts, India deserves to be a
permanent member of the Security Council.
On the issue of global disarmament, the country stuck to a principled
and consistent standpoint, keeping Indias security interests as the
ultimate litmus test of any initiative. As before, it was stressed that India
believes that a nuclear free world would best protect its security concerns
and India shall be at the forefront of any universal and non-discriminatory
regime for nuclear disarmament.
As bilateral security dialogues continued with the major partners,
and began with several others, there was greater understanding and
appreciation of this nuanced stand. At the multilateral level too, India
continued to play an active role in international disarmament debates,
as, for example, in the 55 th UN Millennium General Assembly. A new
Permanent Mission to the Conference on Disarmament was established.
India also participated actively in UN forums on the issue of Human
Rights, calling for a culture of tolerance and pluralism but also warning
against politicisation of the Human Rights debate. High-Level delegations
from India also attended other UN meets on issues like Womens
Development, Climate Change, Social Development and Children.
While the boom in the world economy continued in the first half of
year 2000, ensuring an equitable distribution of the benefits of
globalisation remained a challenge. India was at the forefront in the efforts
to highlight the impact of globalisation on the markets of developing
countries. Indias trade and economic relations registered a steady growth
over the year, with exports rising by 20.51% in the first seven months of
the financial year. There was progressive relaxation of the post-Pokhran

Annual Report 2000-2001

economic restrictions against India by some countries, while Sweden,
Germany, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands resumed
development cooperation.
India maintained over the year that there should be a global
convergence on development, with focus on technology flows from the
North to the South. The Honble Union Minister for Human Resource
Development and Science and Technology led the Indian delegation to
the first ever Summit level meeting of the developing countries at Havana
in April 2000. India played a leading role in the discussions. The Honble
Vice President of India led the Indian delegation to the G-15 summit in
Cairo in June 2000 and helped to highlight Indias stand on issues like a
new WTO Round, Special and Differential needs of Developing
Countries under WTO and revamping of the global financial
architecture. India continued its active participation in the Indian Ocean
Rim Association for Regional Cooperation under which it is involved
in four projects. The Ministry was actively involved in the ongoing
inter-ministerial consultation on the finalisation of the Governments
proposals regarding the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. At various
multilateral meetings, India highlighted the existing iniquities in the
WTO agreements, especially the restrictions imposed on developing
country exports through non-tariff barriers. India participated as a Full
Dialogue Partner of the ASEAN in the 33 rd Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC) in July 2000. As the head of the Indian delegation, the External
Affairs Minister emphasised early action in regulating international
financial flows and the use of Information Technology for development.
At the PMC, India, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Lao
PDR also announced the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation initiative for
cooperation in tourism, culture, education and transport and
communication. The MGC was formally launched in November 2000
at Vientiane in Lao PDR. Indias active participation in the BIMST-EC
continued with the Trade Ministers meeting in New Delhi in April
2000 and the Third BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting in New Delhi in
July 2000, where India took over the Chairmanship of this sub-regional
grouping.
There were concerted efforts to encourage the flow of FDI into
India, particularly in key areas like infrastructure, energy, telecom and
Information Technology. The Investment Technology Promotion
Division of the Ministry spearheaded the promotion and publicity efforts

through the Indian Missions and Posts. Regular feedback was received
from the Missions of investor perceptions about India.
In tandem with Indias active engagement with all the major powers,
traditional partners and other interlocutors and in response to challenges
posed by developments in Fiji and UN peace keeping operations in Sierra
Leone, the External Publicity Division was an active instrument of
foreign policy management, of projecting and explaining Indias
perspective on foreign policy and international security issues.
Simultaneously, the External Publicity Division also undertook the
commissioning of a number of documentary films consonant with our
foreign policy priorities, the maintenance of an updated website, supply
of books for Indian libraries abroad, publication of the monthly India
Perspectives and occasional volumes on important events and issues such
as peace keeping, monitoring the international and domestic media and
managing media related activities for the visits of the President, the VicePresident, the Prime Minister, the External Affairs Minster and other
dignitaries.
With more Indians travelling and working abroad, the importance
of consular services has increased dramatically. There is also a far greater
rush for passports than before. Appropriate improvements, including
computerisation, were continued in these directions to provide efficient
and expeditious service to the citizens. Steps are also being contemplated
to streamline the Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) Cards scheme to make
it more attractive and popular.
In a bid to tap the potential of the vast and successful expatriate
community, and to serve them better, a separate NRI/PIO Division
headed by an Additional Secretary was set up in April 2000. This cell
will act as a focal point for all issues regarding the Overseas Indians. A
High Level Committee on Indian Diaspora was also set up in September
2000 to study the issues and recommend a suitable policy framework
that will facilitate the participation of NRIs and PIOs in the countrys
development efforts. A special website on Indian Diaspora was
inaugurated in December 2000. In January 2001, the Prime Minister
inaugurated the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin in New
Delhi.
Under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme
and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan, assistance was
offered to 144 developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America,
179
xi

Introduction and Synopsis

Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Gulf and the Pacific Island countries.
The programmes earned goodwill for India and boosted the image of its
indigenous skills and expertise. In response to increasing demand for
these programmes, the budget for year 2000-2001 was enhanced to Rs.
42.5 crores. The assistance included Civil and Military Training, Project
related assistance, Deputations of Experts and Study visits of senior
officials.
The Ministry persisted in its efforts to promote the use of Hindi in
its offices as well as Missions/Posts abroad. All important documents 
bilateral treaties, MoUs, Credentials, Speeches or President, Annual
Report of the Ministry and Parliament Questions  were issued
bilingually. Being the Golden Jubilee year of the Declaration of Hindi
as the Official Language, special programmes were organised in the
Missions. Seven Hindi teachers were appointed in Missions abroad to
teach the children of Embassy and other officials. The Leap Office Hindi
Software has been provided to 67 Missions abroad.
The Policy Planning and Research Division, in its role as the nodal
point for interaction with the National Security Council Secretariat,
the University Grants Commission and its affiliates and the Area Study
Centres located in various universities, continued financial assistance to
academic institutions for holding conferences and seminars, preparation
of research papers, exchange of scholars and the promotion of Track II
diplomacy. The PP&R Division also rendered all possible assistance to
territorial divisions whenever required. Modernisation work in the
Ministrys library, which functions under the overall control of the
Division, continued.
The Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) Ordinance, 2000 was
promulgated on the 1 st of September 2000. The Ordinance declared the
Indian Council of World Affairs to be an institution of national
importance and provided for its incorporation and matters connected
therewith. The Ordinance was re-promulgated on the 5 th of January
2001. As a nodal Division dealing with academic/research institutions,
the PP&R Division administered the government funding to the ICWA
and supervised actions for renovation of the premises and for early
commencement of the normal activities of the Council.

The Foreign Service Institute continued its task of training the
personnel of the Ministry, both officers and staff, through regular
modules. The 25 th and 26 th Professional Courses for Foreign Diplomats
were also completed in the financial year. The Computer Centre of the
Institute held a number of courses for MEA personnel, to spread
familiarity and hone skills with computers.
The External Publicity Division of the Ministry is the nodal source
for disseminating the viewpoint of the government on the entire gamut
of international issues. Through regular press briefings, commissioning
of documentary films, maintenance of the Ministry website, supply of
Indian (and its own) publications and audio-visual material abroad, and
the coordination of media related activities, the Division furthered Indian
interests both within and outside the country.
The legal and Treaties Division of the Ministry discharged its usual
duty, defending Indias foreign interests in legal fora abroad and
enshrining them in various international treaties and agreements. In
particular, the legal experts of this Division contributed to the efforts
that led to the International Court of Justice deciding that it had no
jurisdiction to adjudicate on the Pakistani complaint regarding the
downing of its naval aircraft by the Indian Air Force in 1999.
The Indian Council of Cultural Relations carried on its role of acting
as a cultural ambassador for the country by organising exhibitions,
administering scholarships to foreign students and hosting seminars and
performances. With ever-increasing global interest in Indian artistic
and cultural legacies, the councils activities provide one of the finest
ways to reach directly to the people of the world.
Internally in the Ministry, steps were taken to rationalise the
workforce aimed at reduction of non-plan expenditure and achieving
greater efficiency as also encourage Track II diplomacy and to revitalise
institutions like Indian Council of World Affairs for greater interaction
with academicians, scholars and intellectuals. India also warmly
appreciated and gratefully accepted the spontaneous gesture of the world
community in rushing relief supplies for the quake affected areas of
Gujarat.

Afghanistan

ndia remained concerned with the continuing conflict and
resultant upheaval in Afghanistan which impacts on Indias
national interests including security concerns. India, therefore,
closely monitored the evolving situation in Afghanistan. The Taliban
controlled areas in Afghanistan continued to remain major centres
of terrorism and a large source of opium production and illegal flow
of narcotics in the world, posing a serious threat to the peace and
stability of the whole region. India remained firm in its belief that
there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem and that
Afghanistans independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity must be preserved.
The months of July-September 2000 witnessed intense fighting
in Afghanistan. The Taliban launched an attack across Shumali plains
and Bagram airbase in July 2000. In August, the Taliban launched a
multipronged attack to capture Takhar province and succeeded in
capturing Nahreen in Baglan province and Iskamish in Takhar
province. In another attack on 5-6 September 2000, the Taliban also
captured Cal and Taloqan city, the capital of Takhar province.
Subsequently, important towns of Khajagahar, Hazarabagh and
Imamsahib (in Kunduz) were also taken by the Taliban. Commander
Masood launched a counteroffensive in mid-October and retook all
the important towns from the Taliban except the city of Taloqan.

India maintained an active profile in addressing its security
concerns and national interests as impacted upon by the developments
in Afghanistan. The issue was discussed during the visit of US
President Bill Clinton to India in March 2000 and the return visit of
Prime Minister Vajpayee to the US in September 2000. India and
US agreed to institutionalize their bilateral discussions on Afghanistan.
The situation in Afghanistan also came up for discussion during the
visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to India. India and Russia
agreed to coordinate their efforts on Afghanistan and form a Joint
Working Group on Afghanistan. The first meeting of the Joint
Working Group was held on 20-21 November 2000.
Considering the ongoing war and the resultant suffering of the
civilian population, India has been providing humanitarian assistance
to Afghanistan bilaterally and through the UN. During the current
financial year, India has till now sent medicines worth Rs. 33.5 lakhs
to Afghanistan.

Iran
Indias engagement with Iran to expand their multi-faceted
bilateral ties continued during the year under review. The Minister
of External Affairs visited Iran on May 20-23, 2000 to lead the Indian
delegation for the 11th Meeting of Indo-Iran Joint Commission. The
1

India's Neighbours

whole gamut of bilateral cooperation was reviewed and some new
areas were identified. In a significant development, the two countries
acknowledged, given Irans oil and gas reserves and Indias energy
requirements, the existence of a natural complimentarity in the field
of energy. In this context, it was decided to establish a Joint
Committee to consider all aspects including political, economic and
technical in transmission of Iranian gas to India. During his visit to
Iran, EAM also held discussions with Iranian President Syed Mohd.
Khatami, Foreign Minister Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, Minister of
Commerce & Minister of Oil during which all bilateral, regional and
international issues were discussed. President Khatami extended an
invitation to President K.R. Narayanan and Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee to visit Iran. The Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohsen Aminzadeh visited India on July 18-20, 2000 to hold
discussions on bilateral and regional issues with special focus on
Afghanistan.
The first meeting of the Joint Committee on the transfer of
Iranian gas to India was held in Tehran on August 19-20, 2000. In
this meeting both sides discussed and evaluated the issue of
transportation of Iranian gas to India through different options. The
second meeting of this Committee was held in New Delhi on
November 22-23, 2000. The Indian delegation to both the meetings
was led by Secretary[East], while the Iranian delegation was led by
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs Dr. S.M.H.
Adeli. India and Iran agreed to commission a feasibility study on the
deep sea route on equal cost sharing basis.
A new Cultural Exchange Programme for the year 2000-2002
was signed on May 23, 2000. During the 11 th Joint Commission
Meeting in Tehran on May 20-23, 2000 it was decided to set up an
Indian Cultural Centre in Tehran. In November 2000, renowned
Indian and Iranian scholars participated in the Seminar, Civilizations,
Dialogue and National Identity: An India-Iran Conference, which
was held in Delhi. This seminar was an important engagement to
review the civilizational contacts and also look to the future.
2

Third Meeting of Indo-Iranian Working Group on International
Issues was held in New Delhi on 15-16 January 2001. Second Meeting
of India-Iran Joint Working group on Political and Economic Matters
was held in New Delhi on 17-18 January 2001. Third Meeting of
Iran-India Joint Committee on the Transfer of Iranian Gas to India
and annual India-Iran Foreign Office Level Consultations were held
in Tehran on February 13-14, 2001. A delegation from India also
participated in a seminar on Dialogue Among Asian Civilizations
held in Tehran on 17th February 2001.

Pakistan
India remained committed to establishing a relationship of peace,
friendship and cooperation with Pakistan. To this end, India called
on Pakistan to abandon its compulsive hostility, and its consistent
but futile endeavor to damage Indias interests and denigrate its
reputation in the international community. It also called upon
Pakistan to adhere to the Simla Agreement and the Lahore
Declaration, which are the cornerstones of India-Pakistan bilateral
relations. However, Pakistan continued to pursue its negative policy,
especially manifested in its sponsorship of cross-border terrorism and
its vicious anti-India propaganda.
Pakistan stepped up its sponsorship of cross border terrorism in
the State of Jammu & Kashmir and other parts of India. This was
indicated by the qualitative improvement in weapons,
communication- equipment and training given to Pakistan based
terrorist groups such as the Jaish e Muhammed, Lashkar e Tayyaba
and Harkat ul Mujahideen. as well as by the increased support to
infiltration attempts by such groups. Ignoring the deep desire for
peace amongst the people of Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan also
persistently sought to sabotage any prospect of peace in Jammu &
Kashmir whenever initiatives in this regard were taken. The July
2000, unilateral cease-fire announcement by the Hizbul Mujahideen
was sabotaged including through enhanced violence and the massacres

Annual Report 2000-2001

of civilians in Jammu & Kashmir on 1st and 2nd August 2000. Prime
Ministers initiative, announced on 19th November 2000, wherein
directives were given to the Security Forces not to initiate combat
operations against militants in Jammu & Kashmir, was sought to be
eroded through an escalation of violence which included attacks by
Pakistan sponsored terrorists on the Red Fort in New Delhi and the
airport in Srinagar, an aborted assassination attempt on the Chief
Minister of Jammu & Kashmir and threats to attack the office of the
Prime Minister.
India maintained its desire to resume the Composite Dialogue
Process, which was put in place at its initiative in 1998, and which
seeks to build confidence and trust, put in place a stable structure of
cooperation and address all outstanding issues between the two
countries. An appropriate environment free from terrorism and
propaganda is an obvious requirement for the resumption of the
dialogue. Pakistan took no action to facilitate such an environment.
Functional level contacts between the Governments of India and
Pakistan, as well as people-to-people contacts between the two
countries, have continued. The Director Generals of Military
Operations (DGMO) of both Armies maintained weekly contacts.
Officials from BSF and Pak Ranger met regularly to settle border
management issues. The Samjhauta Express and the Delhi Lahore
bus service have continued uninterrupted. And, fishermen who
inadvertently stray into each others territorial waters were released.
Exchanges between academics, retired government officials,
journalists and other opinion makers, as well as visits by religious
pilgrims also continued to take place.
During the year under review the international community also
began focusing on Pakistans state sponsorship of terrorism. Leaders
and official spokesmen of several countries openly acknowledged
the involvement of extremist Pakistani groups in international
terrorism.

In December 2000, Pakistan announced a policy of maximum
restraint along the Indo Pakistan border by bringing down the level
of its unprovoked firing and claiming to withdraw some of its troops,
but continues to support cross-border infiltration and terrorist
operations in India. These self-serving measures did not address Indias
concerns relating to cross border terrorism being sponsored by
Pakistan.
Case in the International Court of Justice

On 10th August 1999, an intruding Pakistan Naval surveillance
cum combat aircraft, Atlantique, was shot down over Indian airspace
after it made hostile maneuvers in response to signals given to it by
intercepting Indian Airforce aircraft. Pakistan made the absurd and
untenable claim for compensation by India for the loss of the intruding
aircraft and for the lives of naval personnel on board. To pursue its
claims for compensation Pakistan filed a case with the International
Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1999. It was clear from the beginning that
there was no real legal basis for the claim; it was intended for purely
propaganda purposes.
India submitted to the International Court of Justice that it did
not have any jurisdiction in the case on account of the reservations
submitted by it in 1974, while accepting the Compulsory Jurisdiction
of the Court. Verbal hearing were held in April 2000 and the Court
delivered its judgment on 21st June 2000, in which it upheld by 14-2
Indias stand that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the
application filed by Pakistan.
Sikh Jathas

In the Year 2000, SGPC again did not send any Sikh jathas to
Pakistan in protest against the formation of Pakistan Gurudwara
Prabandhak Committee (PGPC) headed by a former ISI Chief.
However, some private jathas did visit Pakistan to celebrate various
Sikh religious functions. Over 2000 Sikh pilgrims visited Pakistan
on these occasions. The opportunity was availed of by the Pakistan
government to attempt to indoctrinate the pilgrims against India. A
3

India's Neighbours

jatha of Hindu pilgrims from Shadani Darbar visiting Hayat Patafi
in Sindh (Pakistan) cut short its visit in protest against Pakistanis
back-tracking on its visit to Hinglaj temple and the restrictions
imposed on the jathas movements. Two Pakistani pilgrim groups
visited India on the occasion of the Urs of Hazarat Khawaja
Nizamuddin Aulia and the Urs of Hazarat Khawaja Moinuddin
Chisti.
Regular interaction and exchanges at different levels with
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar succeeded in extending
and deepening the broad-based relationships that exist in diverse areas.
Governments focus has been on enhancing mutually beneficial
linkages in the economic and infrastructural fields, promoting mutual
trust and cooperation in key areas such as security, including the
growing threat of terrorism and religious extremism in the region
and border management; and facilitating people-to-people contact
through programmes for human resource development, cultural
exchanges and travel.
This was done in close coordination with other Ministries/
agencies of the Government of India and with the States bordering
these countries.

Bangladesh
There was high-level interaction in areas including water
resources, trade and defence.
The Minister of Water Resources Shri Arjun Charan Sethi, visited
Bangladesh for the 34th Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) meeting on
12-13 January 2001 in Dhaka. The JRC reviewed India  Bangladesh
cooperation in the field of water resources. The discussions covered,
inter alia, issues relating to sharing of Teesta waters, implementation
of the Treaty on Sharing of the Ganga Waters at Farakka (1996),
strengthening of existing cooperation in flood forecasting and
warning, and matters relating to common / border rivers. India has
agreed to Bangladeshs request for financial and technical assistance
4

for carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering works of the
proposed Ganges barrage project in Bangladesh. Both sides agreed to
cooperate in combating the problem of arsenic contamination of
ground water.
The Minister of State for Water Resources, Smt. Bijoya
Chakravarty had earlier paid a goodwill visit to Bangladesh from
25-29 September 2000. The Bangladesh Parliamentary Standing
Committee on Water Resources paid a goodwill and familiarization
visit to India from November 1-15, 2000. The delegation visited
projects of interest and interacted with officials, inter-alia from the
State governments of West Bengal and Maharashtra.
Bangladesh faced severe floods in September - October 2000 in
the southwestern region. As a gesture of solidarity and support, the
Government of India contributed Rs. 5 crore to the Bangladesh Prime
Ministers Relief Fund.
Mr. C. M. Shafi Sami, Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh visited
New Delhi from August 6-8, 2000 as the Special Envoy of the
Bangladesh Prime Minister and handed over a letter from Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina. He also called on EAM and held discussions
with the Foreign Secretary.
Mr. C. M. Shafi Sami, Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh visited
New Delhi on 13-14 December 2000 for Foreign Office consultations.
The talks covered the entire range of the multi-faceted relations
between India and Bangladesh. The Foreign Secretaries reviewed the
measures for restoration of multi-modal communication links
between the two countries, noted with satisfaction the smooth
operation of the Calcutta-Dhaka bus service and agreed to expedite
the early introduction of a bus service between Agartala and Dhaka.
The two sides reviewed ways and means of enhancing mutually
beneficial trade and economic cooperation, promotion of cooperation
in the areas of water resources, science & technology, the liberalization

other on the issue of ULFA-Bodo militants in Southern Bhutan. The
Royal Government of Bhutan is seriously concerned with this
problem. The National Assembly of Bhutan in its 77th session in July
1999 had unveiled a three pronged strategy to address this issue - (a)
to cut off supply routes to the militants; (b) to initiate firm action
under the National Security Act of 1992 against persons found to be
collaborating with the militants in any form; and (c) to continue the
process of dialogue with the militants to persuade them to leave
Bhutan peacefully. The 78th session of the National Assembly in July
2000 passed a resolution reiterating the decisions taken in the 77th
session and also authorized the Government to launch military
operations against ULFA/Bodo, in case the on going peaceful dialogue
with militants fails to achieve the desired objectives.

South East Asia and the Pacific

T

he Southern Division has under its charge countries
belonging to South-East Asia  ASEAN member countries minus
Myanmar, Australia and New Zealand and Pacific Island countries
including Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Indias relations with these
countries in South East Asia have traditionally been close and warm
as we share a common and historical legacy. With the termination of
cold war and introduction of economic reforms in the last decade of
the last century, there has been a renewed vigour in our relationship
with these countries, both at bilateral level, as well as at the level of
regional grouping i.e. with ASEAN. India following the Look East
policy and our potential as a major market has contributed
significantly towards expanding and diversifying Indias relations with
the ASEAN region. This proximity was further translated into high
level visits taking place from both the sides. India became ASEANs
Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992 and Full Dialogue Partner and
member of the ASEAN Regional Forum in 1996. This partnership
has certainly led India to significantly broaden and diversify its
relationship with ASEAN member countries.
The total bilateral trade between India and ASEAN has reached
a new pinnacle of US$ 7.3 billion in 1999-2000 from US$ 2.5 billion
in 1993-94. This phenomenal increase is despite the fact that most of
the ASEAN members are still in the process of consolidating their
economies in the wake of the financial and economic crisis they
suffered during 1997-1999.

With Australia and New Zealand, there has been a renewal of
friendly relationship, after a brief lull in the wake of Pokharan-II.

between the two countries which included Australian Immigration
Minister, Trade Minister and a Parliamentary Delegation. Minister
of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Murasoli Maran visited New Zealand
in April and his counterpart from New Zealand Mr. Jim Sutton came
to India in November last year.
India had cordial and friendly bilateral relations with South Pacific
Island countries with Fiji, because of its internal situation, being the

member to the United Nations. With Papua New Guinea, the
contacts were made at the Ministerial level in Bangkok on the sidelines
of the ARF-PMC meetings.

armed men and stormed the parliament. They took members of the
government, including Prime Minister Chaudhry as hostages. The
hostage crisis lasted for 56 days and ended on 13 July.
On hearing of the attempted coup on 19 May, the Government
of India issued a statement in which it expressed its deep dismay and
regret and conveyed concern about the welfare and safety of Prime
Minister Mahendra Pal Chaudhry and his cabinet colleagues. The
statement called upon Fiji to uphold the principles of Harare
Declaration and the Milbrook Action Programme. Another statement
was released to the press after Prime Minister Vajpayee received a

racial discrimination.

soon and highlighted the fragility of democratic institutions in Fiji
and in particular the vulnerability of the Indian community. He
further stated that the Commonwealth under whose supervision Fijis
Constitution of 1997 was hammered out is best place to provide the
assurances and guarantees they need and which is in Fijis own longterm interest to secure. The attempts made to revive the Constitution
by setting up a Constitutional Review Committee/Commission are
causing them further anxiety.
Judge Anthony Gates of the Lautoka High Court on 15
November has issued a landmark ruling that the abrogation of the
1997 constitution in the aftermath of George Speights May Coup
was an illegal act. Justice Anthony Gates has consequently directed
that Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara be restored to office as president; that
parliament be reconvened; and that the new Constitution Review
Commission that he has held to be illegal be disbanded immediately.
In a press release issued on 16 November 2000, the Government
of India welcomed Fijis High Courts ruling of 15 November 2000
that the 1997 Constitution remained supreme and extant and that
the Parliament of Fiji, consisting of the President, the Senate and the
house of representatives, was still in being. The High Court has also
held that the Constitution Review Commission had no legal basis.

forces in Fiji and endorses the hope expressed by the High Court
that the military will ensure a smooth and amicable hand-over of
Government under the Constitutional process.

in the sub-regional grouping, BIMST-EC involving Bangladesh,

the six countries viz. Cambodia, India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand
and Vietnam, held in Vientiane on November 9, 2000 would further

fields of tourism, culture and education.
Bilateral trade between India and Thailand which had reached
US $ 651 million in 1996-97 had declined to US $ 577 million in

by the South East Asian region. During the year 1998-99 although
there was a slight improvement in the overall trade (US$ 594) between
the two countries, yet Indian exports declined and Thai exports
increased. With the Thai economy recovering fast, the trend during
1999-2000 ( total trade US $778 million) indicated a handsome growth
in bilateral trade (31%), growth in Indian exports ( 42%) and growth
in imports ( 18%) over the corresponding period of the previous
year.

"
Central Asia

T

he Central Asian region is an extended neighbourhood for
India, with long-standing historical and cultural links
providing the foundation for forging close contemporaneous
relations. Developments in the region have a direct bearing on Indias
national interest and security. The Central Asian States secular
political tradition, significant economic resources including energy,
existing fund of goodwill for India, and present stage of economic
development necessitating a wide variety of goods and technological
skills, make these States and India natural partners.
Nearly ten years have passed since the Central Asian States
became independent. During this period, the objective of Indias
foreign policy has been to establish dynamic and multi-faceted bilateral
relations with them. Political relations with the CAS have been
marked by understanding and convergence of views on a wide range
of regional and global issues. Emergence in recent years of a serious
problem of religious fundamentalism and cross-border terrorism in
many of these States has further underlined the commonality of the
threat faced by Central Asia and India from these negative forces, as
well as the need for joint action against such forces.
The transitional constraints of the Central Asian economies and
the landlocked nature of the region have so far prevented full
realization of the available potential of trade and economic

interactions. These problems are being addressed which should enable
freer flow of trade and more joint ventures in the coming years.
During the year, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan joined the agreement
for transportation of goods from India via Bandar Abbas, thereby
strengthening the usage of the surface route to the region.
Cultural relations continued to be active. The highlight was the
joint celebration of the 500th birth anniversary of Bairam Khan, an
illustrious son of Turkmenistan and a leading figure of Indian history,
in both India and Turkmenistan. Scholarly exchanges were
maintained with all the Central Asian countries. Mission in Tashkent
organised an international conference on pre-Islamic linkages between
India and Central Asia that generated lively interest in the academic
circles.

Azerbaijan
Setting up of a new resident Mission in Baku in March 1999 has

organised cultural programmes and dissemination of tourist and
business information. In the political sphere, consultations with the
Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan were held in May 2000 in Baku during
the visit of Joint Secretary (Central Asia).

process, peace and stability in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
must now return. It is also hoped that the hardship faced by its people
over the past years now will end immediately. India stands for
democratic order and peaceful succession in democracy. Recalling
Indias traditional and historical ties with Yugoslavia, we wish the
new leadership and the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
well, and expect that they will take their rightful place in the
community of nations. The Government on this occasion offers to
President-elect Vojislav Kostunica its warm congratulations and

Western Europe
The year 2000 could well be regarded as the year of achievements
in our relations with Western Europe. Several developments
reinforced the fact that the traditionally close and friendly ties with
our major partners in Europe were on the upswing. While there was
an effort on our part, through a process of dialogue and consultations
to reinvigorate our relationship, both politically and economically,
there was at the same time a discernible desire, both at the level of
the European Union and the individual countries to engage India - a
stable pluralistic democracy and a potential economic power in the
21 st Century.
This convergence in perceptions was highlighted in the first-ever
India-EU Summit held in Lisbon on 28 June under the Portuguese
Presidency of the European Union. The Prime Minister led the Indian
delegation along with four of his Cabinet colleagues. The Summit
marks beginning of a process of building a strategic partnership
between India and the EU. The two sides agreed on an Agenda for

Action to intensify relations in the political, economic and
commercial fields.
With respect to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth Secretary
Generals visit to India and EAMs participation in the
Commonwealth High Level Group Meeting in New York signified
the importance that we continue to attach to the Commonwealth.
At the bilateral level the visits of our President to France, Prime
Minister to Italy and Portugal and EAMs visits to the UK, Switzerland
& Portugal during the year played a very significant role in the
consolidation of our ties with these countries. Similarly incoming
Ministerial visits notably those of UKs Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs Robin Cook and Mr. Peter Hain, Minister of State for Foreign
and Commonwealth Affairs, the French Foreign Minister, two visits
of the German Foreign Minister, the visit of the Italian Foreign
Minister, the Norwegian State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and the
first-ever visit at the Head of State/Head of Government level of the
President of Iceland gave a new thrust to our relations. Official level
dialogue, a greater effort to reach out to a larger audience including
academicians, journalists etc., led to a better appreciation and
understanding of our view points while Parliamentary exchanges with
France, Germany, UK and EU were useful in sensitising them of our
priorities and concerns.
The greater closeness in our relationship achieved through high
level visits was manifested in the support expressed by the EU for
Indias proposal for a Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism. More and more countries came around to accepting Indias
credentials for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
France stated that India is naturally destined to become a member of
the UNSC and it supports Indias candidature. UK said that India is
a natural contender for permanent membership. Portugal said that it
has sympathy for Indias candidature and that it will receive their
support. Iceland also expressed support for Indias candidature and
said that it would work towards obtaining the endorsement of the
Nordic Council.
Europe has continued to move forward on the path of expansion
61

Europe

and further integration. Negotiations have been conducted with 13
officially accepted candidates on the political and economic criteria
for membership. A debate has taken place, at the same time, on
whether these countries should be admitted in a phased manner by
2003 or whether they should all join together between 2008 and 2010.
The expansion process, once completed, will extend the borders of
the EU to Belarus, the Black Sea and Iraq. It will lead to an increase
of 50% in the population but of only 6.7% in the GDP. However,
earlier rounds of EU expansion had seen an increase in our trade
with the countries which had joined.
There is a realisation in the EU that expansion makes it necessary
for it to re-model its structures and decision making processes in
order to continue to function effectively. The Inter-Governmental
Conference, which was launched in early 2000 to address this issue,
has been tasked to finish its task by December 2000. An important
issue to be considered is whether the EC should have at least one
Commissioner from each country or whether there should be a ceiling
on the total number of Commissioners with equal terms for all
member states. The other important issue to be resolved is if the
present procedure of decision making should be replaced by one
which gives greater importance to weighted voting. These ongoing
discussions on reform of EU structures have also provoked a debate
on larger macro-level issues. Various proposals, ranging between a
federal Europe and one with a pioneer or core group of states
have been mooted.
The EU has also progressed towards its goal of evolving a
Common Foreign and Security Policy. The most important decision
in this regard is the creation of a Rapid Reaction Force, by 2003, of
upto 50,000-60,000 persons capable of humanitarian rescue tasks,
peace making and tasks of combat forces in crises management,
including peace making. This would provide the EU with an
autonomous capacity to take decisions and, when NATO as a whole
is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU led military operations in
response to international crises.
The highlight of the relationship with the European Union was
62

the first ever India-EU Summit in Lisbon on 28 June, under the
Portuguese Presidency of the European Union. Prime Minister led
the Indian delegation, which also included the Ministers of External
Affairs, Finance, Commerce and Industry, and Information
Technology. The EU delegation was led by the Prime Minister of
Portugal and included the EC President and the Portuguese Ministers
for Foreign Affairs, Science and Technology, the Deputy Minister
of Economy, European Council Secretary General and the EC
Commissioners for External Relations, Trade and Research.
The Lisbon Joint Declaration, adopted at the conclusion of the
Summit, provides a blueprint for upgrading our relationship with
the EU. The Declaration recognises our commonality of views on
many issues, both political and economic, including the need to build
a strategic partnership in the new century. An Agenda for Action
encompassing joint initiatives in the political, commercial and
economic fields is part of the Declaration. The Declaration reflects
the joint concern on the threat posed by terrorism to regional and
international peace and security.
On the economic side, the Declaration expresses a determination
to work jointly to promote further economic cooperation. It also
expresses a shared commitment to progressively liberalise trade,
oppose protectionist tendencies and work for an open, equitable and
non-discriminatory rule-based multilateral trading system.
Institutional interaction between India and the EU has also been
substantial. The fourth and fifth Senior Officials Meetings were held
in May and November 2000 respectively. The third round of the
India-EC Policy Planners Dialogue was held in New Delhi on
November 27-28, 2000. The India-EU Sub-Commissions on Trade,
Economic Co-operation and Development Co-operation met in
Brussels in November 16-17, 2000. The joint working groups on
agriculture and marine products, textiles, telecommunications,
environment and consular issues set up on the recommendation of
the 10th India-EU Joint Commission held their inaugural meetings in
November 2000. The first meeting of the India-EU Joint Working
Group on Consular Issues was held in New Delhi on November 29,
2000.

Annual Report 2000-2001

Mr. Gerard Collins, Chairman of the Delegation, visited India on
April 17-20, 2000. The delegation interacted with the Speaker and
Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Standing Committees on External
Affairs, Commerce, Human Resource Development, Science &
Technology and Environment & Forests.
Economic co-operation between India and the EU has also
progressed during this period. A major step towards easing the
protectionist tendencies in the EC was its decision to release the full
exceptional flexibility of 8000 tonnes in textiles. Discussions are
continuing on the differences between the two sides in other product
categories such as rice, steel etc. A project for technical cooperation
in the civil aviation sector was signed during the Lisbon Summit.
The 2nd Meeting of the India-EU JWG on Consular Issues will
be held in New Delhi on 24 January 2001. This meeting will discuss
in greater detail the issues taken up at the inaugural meeting.

interaction at expert level on the linked issues of international
terrorism, drug trafficking and trade in arms. The first meeting of
this Group will be held in the first half of 2001, during the Swedish
Presidency of the EU.
The EU made considerable progress towards reform and
enlargement during the EU Nice Summit which was held on
December 8-11, 2000. The significant decisions at the Summit related

to qualified majority voting procedures and representation in the
European Parliament. These have paved the way for the admission
of new members from the end of 2002. It was also agreed that an
inter-government conference would be held in 2004 to discuss me
legal aspects of EU reforms. Furthermore, the Summit endorsed the
decision on the creation of a Rapid Reaction Force, a major step
towards giving the EU autonomous decision-making capacity in
peace-keeping and peace-making. A Franco-German Summit will be
held in Strasbourg on 31 January 2001 to discuss further co-operation
after the EU Nice Summit. Sweden, which took over the EU
Presidency on 1 January 2001, has indicated that Enlargement,
Employment and Environment will be its top priorities during its
Presidency.
Indias commitment to the Commonwealth was reiterated with
our active participation in the deliberations of the Commonwealth
High Level Group, the Senior Officials Meeting and in hosting the
Conference of Commonwealths Ministers Responsible for Womens
Affairs.
External Affairs Minister led the Indian delegation to the Summit
meeting of the Commonwealth High Level Group (HLG) on 5
September 2000 in New York. The HLG reviewed the role of the
Commonwealth in the changing economic and global scenario and
reiterated the Commonwealths commitment to upholding the
principles enshrined in the Harare Declaration and the Millbrook
Action Programme. It agreed that the Commonwealths core areas
of competence include democracy, human dignity, opposition to
racial prejudice and discrimination, good governance and sustainable
development.

economic interaction and for the identification of specific projects
for co-operation.

Foreign Secretary led the Indian delegation to the first meeting
of Senior Officials of Members of Commonwealth High Level Group

Role of Commonwealth. The SOM was characterised by candour
and a constructive approach to both the Commonwealths immediate
problems as also for determining the vision for the organization in
the years ahead. There was a clear consensus that the Commonwealth
should continue to focus on its primary strengths, which lay in the
area of democracy, good governance, human rights and sustainable
economic development.

T

he process of deepening ties and broadening engagement with
the United States gathered new momentum and strength
during the year. The two sides laid the foundation of building a
closer and qualitatively new relationship, based on equality and
mutual respect, and established a comprehensive architecture of wideranging institutional dialogue to pursue the new relationship. The
vision of a new relationship has resulted from growing dialogue
between the two sides in recent years. It is predicated on the
recognition of the many shared values, interests and opportunities
for mutually beneficial co-operation, and of the important and positive
role that closer Indo-US relations can play in the global affairs in the
21st century.

For the first time in the history of their bilateral relations, the
two countries exchanged State visits in the same year. The US
President, H.E. William J. Clinton, visited India from 21-25 March
2000 and Prime Minister paid an official visit to USA from 13-17
September 2000. Prime Minister and President Clinton outlined on
21st March in New Delhi the vision of a new relationship in the 21st
Century between India and United States. They also agreed on an
architecture of wide-ranging institutional dialogue as a means to pursue
the new relationship. Prime Ministers visit contributed to accelerating
the momentum of building the new relationship. Besides, the State
70

visits, the two sides intensified their dialogue and expanded
cooperation across a wide range of bilateral, regional and international
issues.
President Clinton visited India from 21-25 March. A US
presidential visit to India took place after a gap of 22 years. The fiveday tour covering five cities was one of the most extensive visits
undertaken by him to any country. President Clinton visited Delhi,
Agra, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Mumbai.
The two sides agreed to cast aside the doubts of past and chart a
new purposeful direction in bilateral relations in order to build a
closer and qualitatively new relationship between the two largest
democracies in the world. President Clinton described the objective
of his visit as strengthening a friendship that indeed is critical to the
future of the entire planet.
The Vision Statement outlines the contours, and defines the
agenda of the partnership between India and the United States in the
21st century. The Statement emphasises the commonality, the shared
values and common interests between the two countries. It recognises
that commitment to the principles and practice of democracy
constitutes the bedrock of our bilateral relations and for our cooperative efforts internationally on issues of common concerns. It
expresses the shared belief that the relationship between the two
countries could be a vital factor in shaping international peace,

Annual Report 2000-2001

prosperity and democratic freedom and for ensuring strategic stability
in Asia and beyond. It articulates the desire of the two countries to
strengthen and broad base bilateral cooperation.
The Dialogue Architecture envisages regular summits between
the Prime Minister of India and the US President. In addition, it
includes ministerial level Foreign Policy Dialogue between EAM and
US Secretary of State; a ministerial level Security Dialogue; Foreign
Office Consultations and Asian Security Dialogue between Foreign
Secretary and US Under Secretary of State; High Level Coordinating
Group on Bilateral Economic Dialogue and ministerial level IndoUS Financial and Economic Forum, Indo-US Commercial Dialogue
and Indo-US Working Group on Trade; Joint Working Group on
Counter-terrorism; Joint Working Group on Clean Energy and
Environment; and, Indo-US Science & Technology Forum. During
the subsequent visit of Prime Minister to the United States in
September, the two sides agreed to establish an institutional dialogue
on UN Peacekeeping Operations and set up a framework of bilateral
dialogue on Afghanistan.
In addition, during President Clintons visit, India and the US
signed an agreement for setting up of a Science and Technology Forum
and issued a Joint Statement on Co-operation in Energy and
Environment. Several private sector joint initiatives were also
launched.
Prime Minister paid an official visit to Washington from 13-17
September at the invitation of the US President. Prime Minister was
given the honour of being the only foreign leader to address the
Joint Sitting of the 106th Congress of the US, and being welcomed
through a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives and
the Senate, which also called for building stronger Indo-US relations.
Prime Minister had a restricted and a delegation-level meeting with
President Clinton and attended a banquet hosted in his honour by
President Clinton and Mrs. Hillary Clinton. He held talks with Vice
President Albert Gore, who also hosted a lunch at the State
Department in honour of the Prime Minister.

Besides addressing a Joint Sitting of the US Congress, he also had
separate meetings with the Speaker, the House Democratic leadership,
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the House International
Relations Committee, the Congressional Caucus on India and IndianAmericans as also other leading Senators and Congressmen. His other
engagement included meetings with the US business community and
the Indian community as well as interactions with leading foreign
policy think tanks and academics. Prime Minister and President
Clinton together dedicated the Gandhi Memorial Statue at a public
park in front of the India Embassy in Washington.
The visit helped in consolidating the new phase of friendship
and cooperation with the United States and deepening understanding
between the two sides. Both sides recognise that the visit helped in
accelerating the upward path in bilateral relations, thus contributing
to the process of building the new relationship, envisaged in the Vision
Statement of March 2000. While emphasising the bilateral
opportunities, both sides also placed the relationship in the larger
international context, based on shared values, complementary
strengths and growing convergence of interests and opportunities.
President Clinton reiterated that Indo-US relations would become
one of the important factors in international affairs in the near future.
Prime Ministers interactions with the two presidential candidates,
the US Congress, the business community, think tanks and
academicians, and the Indian-American community is expected to
further strengthen the broad-based and bipartisan support that exists
for stronger relations with India, and contribute to maintaining
continuity and momentum in Indo-US relations with the new
Administration. Both presidential candidates - Vice President Gore
and Governor George Bush  in their respective conversations with
PM, assured continuity in US policy towards India.
A Joint Statement was issued after the meeting between Prime
Minister and President Clinton. It reaffirms the vision outlined by
the Prime Minister and President Clinton in March and expresses
satisfaction on the progress made in implementing the Dialogue
Architecture. It also reiterates the desire of the two countries to
71

The Americas

intensify dialogue and co-operation in political and security matters,
trade and commerce, finance and investment, health, energy and
environment, science and technology and counter-terrorism. In
addition, the two sides agreed to add UN Peacekeeping and
Afghanistan to the existing architecture of institutional dialogue.
Following the visit of President Clinton, the two sides quickly
implemented all the elements of the Dialogue Architecture. Minister
of External Affairs, Shri Jaswant Singh, met the US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for the Ministerial-level Foreign Policy Dialogue
on 26 June 2000 in Warsaw, where both were participating in the
first ministerial meeting of the Community of Democracies, at the
ARF Meet in Bangkok in July and again in New York in September.
EAM and US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot met in July
2000 on the margins of the ARF Meeting in the context of the ongoing
Dialogue on Security and Non-proliferation. Foreign Secretary and
US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Pickering met
in New Delhi on 24-25 May 2000 and in Washington on 31 August 
1 September 2000 for the Foreign Office Consultations and the Asian
Security Dialogue.

means. Both sides stressed the unacceptability of continued violence
and bloodshed as a basis for solution of the problems of the region.
In this context, the two sides also agreed that there is incompatibility
between continued violence in Jammu & Kashmir and dialogue.
The High Level Coordinating Group on bilateral economic
dialogue held its first meeting in Delhi on 21-22 August 2000. The
India-US Financial and Economic Forum was constituted during the
visit of Finance Minister to Washington in April 2000 and met in
Washington in September 2000 during the visit of Prime Minister.
The India-US Commercial Dialogue was constituted by Minister of
Commerce and Industry and US Commerce Secretary during the
visit of President Clinton in March and met again in Washington in
September 2000.

The Ministerial-level Foreign Policy Dialogue and Foreign Office
Consultations provide the two sides the opportunity to review
bilateral ties and progress in cooperation in diverse fields, and to
exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual concern.
The Asian Security Dialogue, a new element of institutional dialogue
between the two countries, reflects the growing dialogue, and desire
for cooperation, between the two countries on international security
issues, especially in the Asian context. During Prime Ministers visit,
the two sides agreed to establish a framework of bilateral dialogue on
issues of mutual concern in Afghanistan. The two sides have assessed
positively their ongoing dialogue on Security, Non-proliferation and
Disarmament and have agreed to continue the dialogue to further
narrow the differences in this area.

India and the United States have institutionalised their
cooperation to combat international terrorism through a Joint
Working Group (JWG) on Counter-terrorism. The first meeting of
the JWG was held on 7-8 February 2000. The second meeting of the
Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism was held on 25-26
September 2000 in New Delhi. The two sides agreed on a range of
measures to enhance cooperation between the two countries to
combat international terrorism, including through sharing
experiences, exchanging relevant information, anti-terrorism training
and coordinating approaches and action. The Joint Working Group
also expressed support for Indias proposal for a UN Comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism, and agreed to work towards
this end. The Group also welcomed the addition of narco-terrorism
and drug trafficking to its mandate. As part of the efforts to intensify
law enforcement cooperation in combating terrorism and
international crime, the two sides are negotiating a Mutual Legal
Assistance Treaty. There is now increased recognition by the United
States of the problem of terrorism in South Asia and the nature and
origin of cross-border terrorism in India.

The two sides reaffirmed their belief that tensions in South Asia
can only be resolved by the nations of South Asia, and by peaceful

The Joint Consultative Group on Energy and Environment held
its first meeting on 26-28 July 2000 in Washington. The Group decided

72

Annual Report 2000-2001

to revive the Bilateral Energy Consultation in order to promote IndoUS commercial and government-government cooperation in the
development of the energy sector in India. The Group also decided
to promote specific technology development projects in the Indian
energy industry.
The Science & Technology Forum, which is expected to facilitate
contacts and collaborative projects between the scientific communities
of the two countries, was registered in July. The two sides also issued
two Joint Statements in Washington on 13 June 2000 on cooperation
in the Health Sector, focusing on cooperative research on maternal
and child health and on HIV/AIDS.
After the announcement of the decision to institutionalise
cooperation and dialogue on UN Peacekeeping Operations, made
during the visit of Prime Minister to the US in Washington, the two
sides met in New Delhi on 1-2 November 2000 for the first meeting
of the Indo-US Joint Working Group on UN Peacekeeping
Operations. India is a major contributor to the UN peacekeeping
efforts. The Joint Working Group aims to increase mutual
understanding on UN peacekeeping issues and contribute to making
UN peacekeeping more effective, including on policy, functional and
operational aspects. Admiral Dennis Blair, Commander-in-Chief of
the US Pacific Command, came to India in September on his second
visit to the country in 2000. The Principal Deputy Under Secretary
of Defence for Policy James Bodner visited India in November 2000,
which was the first high level civilian Defence contact between the
two sides since imposition of US restrictions on India in 1998.
The United States has progressively eased some of the restrictions,
especially those relating to economic measures, that it had imposed
under its domestic law following the nuclear tests of May 1998.
Restrictions continue to be maintained on US support for lending
by International Financial Institutions to India, certain credit and
credit guarantees by US Governmental agencies to India, export of
items on the US Munitions List and export of dual use items and
technologies. The United States also maintains an Entity List of Indian

organisations, which are subject to tighter export controls. The US
has removed 53 Indian organisations from the Entity List from the
original list of over 200 organisations.
Government maintains that all unilateral restrictions against India
are unjustified and counter-productive and should be completely
lifted. Several leading members of the US Congress have individually
and collectively written to the US President to waive the remaining
restrictions on India.
Republican Party candidate, Texas Governor George W. Bush
became the 43rd President of the United States following the U.S.
Presidential Elections held in November 2000. President George W.
Bush and his key foreign policy advisors have indicated a desire to
continue broadening engagement and strengthening relations with
India. The Bush Administration is engaged in reviewing the sanctions
currently in place, including the remaining sanctions against India.
Secretary of State Colin Powell stated this publicly during the
confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations. The U.S. Administration welcomed on 24th January the
announcement of further extension of unilateral cessation of combat
operations in Jammu & Kashmir and called for an end to violence by
militant groups.
A US Congressional delegation led by Congressman Jim
McDermott, co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and
Indian-Americans of the US Congress visited India from 8th -14th
January 2001. Mr. Arlen Specter, a senior US Senator from the
Republic Party, visited India from 3rd - 6th January 2001.
President Bush issued a statement on 26th January, extending
condolence to the families of the victims of the earthquake and
offering assistance for rescue and relief measures. Prime Minister and
President Bush also spoke on phone on 30th January. The U.S. also
provided assistance for rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts. The
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Office of
U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the U.S. Department
of Defence together provided assistance valued at U.S. $ 3.5 million
73

in the immediate period after the earthquake. A ten-member U.S.
team of experts operated in New Delhi and affected areas to assist in
the relief and rehabilitation efforts.

Canada
Political relations between India and Canada remained somewhat
cool during the year, following Canadas excessive reaction to our
nuclear tests in May 1998. Nevertheless, there were some useful
interactions between the two countries.
The third meeting of the India-Canada Joint Working Group on
Terrorism was held in New Delhi on February 15-16, 2000. During
the meeting, the two sides exchanged information and views on the
activities of various terrorist groups. Multilateral aspects of counter
terrorism including the Indian Draft Convention against Terrorism
and G-8 deliberations were discussed. Both sides viewed the Working
Group as a useful mechanism that will strengthen other existing
mechanisms to combat terrorism such as the Extradition Treaty and
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.
A Canadian delegation led by Paul Myer, Director General,
International Security Bureau of the Canadian Foreign office visited
India for a security dialogue on March 15-16, 2000. On the core nuclear
issue, the Canadian delegation reiterated its position that Canada
attached a great deal of importance to the NPT and CTBT. The
Indian delegation on its part reiterated that India has always been in
favour of complete nuclear disarmament and it will be guided solely
by its national security considerations on the question of the CTBT.
It was also conveyed that India regards the NPT as arbitrary and
discriminatory, used by the P-5 to enhance their nuclear arsenal while
keeping others out and expressed reservations about its extension in
the present form.
An 11-member delegation led by Minister of Petroleum and
Natural Gas, Shri Ram Naik visited Canada to participate in the 16th
World Petroleum Congress held at Calgary from June 11 -15, 2000.
Apart from conference activities, the Minister had a meeting with
the Secretary General of OPEC Dr. Lukman. He also met with the
74

Premier of Alberta, Mr. Ralph Klein, who he invited to visit the
Petro-Tech Conference and Exhibition to be held in India from
January 9- 11, 2001.
After fifteen long years of dogged investigations into the Kanishka
crash, on October 27, 2000 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP) arrested Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri from
the Vancouver area in connection with the case. A third person,
Hardial Singh Johal, ex-President of Surrey Gurudwara, was arrested
but released on October 31 without being charged. RCMP said that
more suspects were likely to be arrested.
Mr. Ujjal Dosanjh, Premier of British Columbia, Canada paid a
seventeen-day visit to India from December 18, 2000 to January 4,
2001. Mr. Dosanjh is the first First Generation Indian to have
attained such prominence in political life in Canada. The visit was
undertaken at the invitation of External Affairs Minister.
During the visit, Premier Dosanjh called on the Prime Minister
and Ministers of External Affairs, Human Resource Development,
Information Technology and Health, besides Leader of the
Opposition. He also had interaction with various business and cultural
bodies.
Apart from Delhi, the Premier visited Punjab, Hyderabad,
Bangalore and Mumbai where he was warmly received by dignitaries
of the respective States. In Punjab where he spent seven days, he
signed along with Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal, a general
agreement on cooperation between the Governments of Punjab and
British Columbia. The visit attracted considerable media attention
and interest and added an additional dimension to the bilateral
relations between India and Canada.

Latin America and the Caribbean
India has traditionally enjoyed problem-free and friendly relations
with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region. Our
main policy objective towards the region has been to strengthen and
deepen the existing relationship and to impart to it a greater economic

Annual Report 2000-2001

content. Our interactions and cooperation, at the bilateral as well as
at the multilateral levels, have been of mutual benefit. India currently
maintains 13 resident diplomatic missions and one post in the region.
Through concurrent accreditation most of the other twenty countries
are covered. Twelve countries from the region have their resident
missions in New Delhi.
An important component of our bilateral relations has been the
mechanism of Foreign Office level bilateral consultations. Over the
years we have signed MoUs on the subject with thirteen countries
from the region and a few more are under active consideration. The
regular review of bilateral relations has helped us to focus better on
the potentials and concerns of our dialogue partners and has led to
improved coordination on multilateral issues of common interest.
Other official and technical level visits have reinforced the gains of
the Foreign Office level consultations. In the economic and trade
arenas there has been growing interaction at the private sector level
giving depth to our relationships.
As a follow-up of the FOCUS LAC Programme of the
Government of India, participation by Indian Export Promotion
Councils and business houses in international exhibitions in the Latin
American and Caribbean region as well as visits by trade delegations
to the region have helped in the dissemination of valuable information
on Indian commodities and technological advancement. Concerted
efforts have been made to overcome the barriers of distance and
language. In this context another important element has been the
globalization process as a result of which many economies in the
region have been opening up for enhanced cooperation. We have
signed trade and economic agreements with seven countries of the
region and set up business councils with some others. As a result of
the growing understanding between the private sectors a number of
accords have also been signed between the apex trade and industrial
bodies. However, because of the economic difficulties that the region
as a whole continued to experience during the year, the actual increase
in overall trade with India was marginal and currently stands at US$
1.50 billion only.

Culturally India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region.
Indian philosophy, yoga and Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings have
been a source of inspiration for many in the region. Between them
the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have named more
than five hundred institutions, schools, libraries, streets and squares
after India and its leaders. As a mark of respect to our Father of
Nation, his busts and statues have been installed at important places
in a number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. At
the institutional level we have cultural agreements and cultural
exchange programmes with fourteen countries in the LAC area.
Indian artists and academics have been visiting the region with the
help of the ICCR. ICCR administered scholarships have brought
interested students to Indian academic institutions. Indian Cultural
Centres have been flourishing in countries with substantial
populations of persons of Indian origin such as Suriname, Trinidad
& Tobago and Guyana. Technical assistance under the ITEC
Programme for officials, experts and technical personnel for training
and study tours in India is another important mechanism by which
we forge mutually beneficial relations with LAC countries.
The region has witnessed steady progress towards democratisation
and economic liberalisation. Presidential elections were held during
the reporting period in Mexico, Suriname, Venezuela, Dominican
Republic, Haiti and Peru, though in the case of the last mentioned
country electoral malpractice resulted in the ouster of the Fujimori
government and its replacement by an interim government which
will oversee fresh elections next year. Parliamentary elections also
took place during the year in Trinidad & Tobago (December) and in
Guyana (March). There has also been a tendency towards the
deepening of a pan-American approach to national and international
issues. Keeping the above in mind we have established institutional
relations with regional organisations. India has observer status with
the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Association of
Caribbean States (ACS) and the Andean Community. Our High
Commissioner in Georgetown (Guyana) is concurrently accredited
as Indias Ambassador to CARICOM. We have been participating
75

The Americas

regularly in the meetings of these organisations. Mechanism for

T

Millennium Summit/Assembly (6-22 September 2000)

he Millennium Summit was held in New York between
September 6-8, 2000. The event was the largest ever
gathering of Heads of State or Government, with over 150 Heads
of State and/or Government participating in the summit. The Summit
was jointly presided over by the Presidents of Namibia and Finland.
Most developing countries used the opportunity to centre stage issues
of concern to them, including the need for reform and restructuring
of the UN Security Council. Over 155 countries made a specific
reference to the need for reform and restructuring of the Security
Council in their statement at the Millennium Summit or Assembly.
Over 70 countries indicated their support for expansion of both
permanent and non-permanent categories of Security Council
membership, and many expressed support for representation of both
developed and developing countries in an enlarged permanent
category.
From Indias point of view, the Declaration adopted by the
Millennium Summit by and large reflects Indias interests, referring
as it does to the principles of sovereignty, non-interference and the
value of tolerance. It recognises the need for a comprehensive reform
of Security Council. It also calls for an international conference to
identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers and calls on the
80

international community to strive and to seek to eliminate the dangers
of weapons of mass destruction. The Declaration, further articulates
the resolve of the International community to take concerted action
against international terrorism, and to accede, as soon as possible, to
all the relevant international conventions.
The high level Indian delegation to the Millennium Summit was
led by Prime Minister, Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee, who addressed it
on 8th September 2000. In his statement, PM inter alia called for
concerted global action against international terrorism, and for early
conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention against Terrorism.
PM also reiterated Indias natural claim to permanent membership
of an expanded Security Council based on any objective criteria.
During the Millennium Summit, a number of International
Conventions were made available for signatures and ratification. On
behalf of India, Prime Minister, signed the International Convention
for Suppression of Terrorist Financing.
EAM, Shri Jaswant Singh, accompanied PM to New York from
5-13 September, 2000 to participate in the Millennium Summit. EAM
represented India at the Round Table Meetings on 8 & 9 September,
that had been organised as interactive sessions of the Millennium
Summit, where he inter alia stressed the need for the international
community to realise a nuclear free world, and to decisively confront
the challenges arising from terrorism, drugs and illicit arms trafficking.

Annual Report 2000-2001

EAM, Shri Jaswant Singh, also led the high level Indian delegation
to the 55 th regular session of the UN General Assembly (ie., the
Millennium Assembly) from 18-20 September 2000. EAM addressed
the UN General Assembly in the general debate, on 19 September
2000, urging a nuclear free world and calling on the international
community to decisively confront the challenges arising from
terrorism, drugs and illicit arms trafficking, particularly when
combined with religious fanaticism and military adventurism. EAM
also pointed out that although the UN has expanded manifold in the
last century, with its membership standing at 189, yet the Security
Council continued to have the same basic structure as in the colonised
world of 1945. The impact of the actions of the Security Council
however, were felt with near total exclusivity by the developing
countries, yet they had little influence on its decision making. EAM
further pointed to the emerging global consensus that the form taken
by the Security Council in the aftermath of the second world war
was outmoded and that it must reflect the logic of an enlarged
membership. In this context, he reaffirmed Indias willingness to take
on the responsibilities of permanent membership.
India participated actively and constructively in the preparatory
process for the UN Millennium Summit and Assembly and ensured
that its interests were accommodated in the relevant outcomes. A
separate process for follow up to the Declaration has been instituted
and India continues to an active participant there.
India was also closely associated with and consulted extensively
on the annual General Assembly resolution on the Situation in
Afghanistan and its implications for peace and security, which it
also co- sponsored. The resolution inter alia reiterated the central
role that the UN should play in finding a solution to the Afghan
problem, called on the Taliban to cease all armed hostilities, referred
to the large number of non-Afghan personnel, mainly on the side of
the Taliban forces, who are drawn from religious schools etc and
strongly condemned foreign military support to Afghan parties. It
also reiterated the view that the continuing conflict in Afghanistan

posed a growing risk to peace and stability in the region. The
resolution further demanded that the Taliban refrain from providing
safe haven to international terrorists and their organisations, cease
the recruitment of terrorists, close terrorist training camps and take
effective measures to ensure that their territory is not used to sponsor
international terrorist operations. It also called on the Taliban to
halt all illegal drug related activities and to support the international
efforts to ban illegal drug production and trafficking. The resolution
was cosponsored by 80 countries (higher than ever before) showing
the extent of isolation of the Taliban regime.

UNGA Emergency Special Session
(18-19 October 2000)
At the request of the League of Arab States, the Tenth Emergency
Special Session of the UN General Assembly was convened on 18
and 19 October 2000. Apart from Israel, Palestine, several P-5
members and South Africa, which spoke on behalf of NAM, 54
countries spoke at the Meeting. The Indian statement was delivered
by Shri M.L.Khurana, who was in New York as part of the Indian
non-official delegation. The statement called for exercise of restraint,
avoidance of provocation, need to shun the use of force or
encouragement to violence and stressed the need for dialogue and
peaceful negotiations to find a just, comprehensive and lasting
settlement of all issues between the two sides. At the same time, in
keeping with our tradition of solidarity and support for the Palestinian
cause, we associated ourselves with the NAM Statement. The 10th
Emergency Special Session of the GA adopted a resolution on Illegal
Israeli actions in occupied Jerusalem and rest of the occupied
Palestinian territory by a vote of 92 for, 6 against and 46 abstentions.
The Resolution, inter alia, condemned the violence that took place
on 28 September 2000, expressed support for the understandings
reached at the Sharm-El-Sheikh Summit in Egypt, demanded
immediate cessation of violence, and that Israel, the occupying power,
abide scrupulously by its legal obligations under the fourth Geneva
Convention and reiterated that Israeli settlements in the occupied
81

United Nations and International Organisations

understanding reached at Sharm-El-Sheikh on a Committee of Fact
Finding and called for its establishment without delay.

meetings of the Security Council on a number of issues, including

Security and the Situation in the Middle East. Our statement on
Women and Peace and Security, on 24 October 2000, was delivered
by Smt. Krishna Bose, Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on External Affairs.
Afghanistan

In view of our deep and abiding concern over developments in
Afghanistan, India worked closely with countries such as Russia, EU,
US etc, and co sponsored the resolution in Security Council to further
extend sanctions against the Taliban. The resolution which was tabled
by Russia and USA was cosponsored by Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
India. The Resolution called on the Taliban to stop all support to
terrorism and to close all terrorist training camps. It also imposed
further sanctions on the Taliban, including an arms embargo, and
restrictions on travel of all senior Taliban officials of the rank of
Deputy Minister or higher, the equivalent rank of armed personnel
under the control of the Taliban, and other senior advisers and
dignitaries of the Taliban. The resolution also extends the freeze on
funds and other financial assets of Usama bin Laden and individuals
and entities associated with him.
India was also closely associated with and consulted extensively
on the annual General Assembly resolution on the Situation in
Afghanistan and its Implications for Peace and Security , which it
also co- sponsored. The resolution inter alia reiterated the central
role that the UN should play in finding a solution to the Afghan
problem, called on the Taliban to cease all armed hostilities, referred
82

to the large number of non-Afghan personnel, mainly on the side of
the Taliban forces, who are drawn from religious schools etc and
strongly condemned foreign military support to Afghan parties. It
also reiterated the view that the continuing conflict in Afghanistan
posed a growing risk to peace and stability in the region. The
resolution further demanded that the Taliban refrain from providing
safe haven to international terrorists and their organisations, cease
the recruitment of terrorists, close terrorist training camps and take
effective measures to ensure that their territory is not used to sponsor

Visit by Francesc Vendrell, Personal Representa-tive of the
UNSG on Afghanistan to India

Francesc Vendrell, Personal Representative of the UNSG on
Afghanistan and Head of UN Special Mission on Afghanistan visited
India from May 2-5, 2000 and had meetings with External Affairs
Minister and Foreign Secretary. While consulting India, he also
provided a detailed briefing on his visits to Islamabad, Kabul,
Dushanbe, Ashgabat, Tashkent and Moscow. The visit assumed

and called on EAM, FS and the Secretary of National Security

Election of Non-Permanent members

On 10th October, 2000, the UN General Assembly elected five
new non-permanent members of the Security Council. - Colombia,
Ireland, Mauritius, Norway and Singapore for the term 2001-2002.

Annual Report 2000-2001

These countries would replace the outgoing, Argentina, Canada,
Malaysia, Namibia and the Netherlands, whose term expires on 31st
December, 2000.
The vacancy from the Western European and other States
(WEOG), was only filled in the fourth round of voting after Norway
obtained the required majority of 115 votes, versus Italys 57. The
African seat was also filled during the fourth ballot when Mauritius
received 113 votes, one more than the required majority.
The five other non-permanent Security Council members, who
will serve for another year, until 31 December 2001, are Bangladesh,
Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine.
Conflict Diamonds

The nexus between illegally traded diamonds and its funding of
rebel movements in Africa moved to centre stage of the international
agenda. On July 5, 2000, the Security Council, acting under Chapter
VII of the Charter, adopted Resolution 1306(2000) banning trade in
conflict diamonds for a period of 18 months, and calling on all states
to take necessary measures to prohibit the direct or indirect import
of such conflict diamonds. India welcomed this development and
has supported the ban on conflict diamonds.

Subsequently on 1 st December, the UN General Assembly
adopted a comprehensive resolution on The Role of Diamonds in
Fuelling Conflict. The Resolution was adopted without a vote and
was co-sponsored by over 50 countries including Russia, Israel and
India. Our concerns, as a country where the diamond industry makes
an important contribution to the economy were to ensure that such
measures did not affect legitimate trade in diamonds which provides
employment to over 1 million people nor divert attention from
genuine development concerns. Moreover, the Resolution provides
that any international certification should be based primarily on
national certification schemes.
Admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to UN
membership

In a unanimous decision, the Security Council on 31st October

recommended to the General Assembly that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia be admitted to membership in the United Nations. The
Security Council acted in response to an application for membership
submitted by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, who cited
fundamental democratic changes in his country as the impetus
behind the request. Fulfilling the requirement for all States seeking
to join the UN, President Kostunica pledged to accept the obligations
contained in the UN Charter and undertook to fulfil them.
Subsequently, on 1 st November 2000, the UN General Assembly
adopted a unanimous resolution endorsing the Security Councils
decision and admitted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a UN
member. India had co-sponsored this GA resolution.
Security Council Restructuring and Reform

The debate on Security Council restructuring and reform
received some fillip in April 2000, when the USA indicated its
readiness to consider an expanded Security Council of more than 21
members, thereby removing what had earlier been a major road block.
Further dynamism to the debate on the issue was imparted by the
statements at the Millennium Summit and Assembly by a large
number of countries calling for reform and restructuring of the
Security Council, expansion of both the permanent and nonpermanent categories of Security Council membership, and for
representation of both developed and developing countries in an
enlarged permanent category.
The Question of Equitable Representation on and increase in
the Membership of the Security Council and related matters was
further debated in the UNGA plenary on 16 th & 17 th November
2000. 108 countries spoke in the debate this year, the largest number
in recent years.
Support for Indias candidature for a permanent seat in the
Security Council

There was enhanced momentum in support of Indias candidature
for permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Among
the P-5 (permanent 5 members of the Security Council), several made
positive indications and/or supported Indian candidature for a
83

United Nations and International Organisations

permanent seat in the Security Council. During the visit of President
Shri K.R.Narayanan to France in April 2000, the French President
Jacques Chirac stated in his banquet speech on 17 April, 2000 that
India is naturally destined to become a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council. France supports and will support
your candidature. During the debate in the UNGA plenary on 16
November 2000, the Russian representative stated, The Russian
Federation considers India a strong and worthy candidate for a
permanent membership seat in the Security Council should it be
decided to enlarge the Council in both categories. The UK and the
US have given positive indications, acknowledging India as a natural
contender. On 7 th October 2000, a senior official of the US
Administration stated there is no question that India is a very strong
contender for permanent membership of the Security Council. Its
size, role in the world, its economy, its contribution to UN
peacekeeping, all these make it a very serious and strong contender.
Robin Cook, British Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, on his visit to India from 15-18 April 2000,
indicated that UK sees India as a natural contender for permanent
membership of the UN Security Council.
During the Millennium Summit and Millennium Assembly,
Cambodia, Vietnam and Bhutan, reiterated their support for Indias
candidature. There were also, indications of support from several
other countries during bilateral discussions.

to UN peacekeeping operation. The bulk of Indian troops (over 3000)

22, 1999, India had contributed two Infantry battalions, Aviation
Units and support elements to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNAMSIL). In the beginning of May 2000, the main rebel
group, Revolutionary United Front (RUF), reneged on its
commitments under the Rome Peace Agreement of July 1999, and
started hostilities against the UN peacekeeping forces. For nearly
two and a half months, 221 Indian peacekeepers and 11 military
observers were surrounded by the RUF. The role of the Indian troops,
under the command of Major General V.K. Jetley, in lifting the siege,
was highly commended by the UN and the world media. During the
operation, there was, unfortunately, a loss of life of an Indian soldier.
Following the decision to withdraw Indian troops from
UNAMSIL in a phased manner, de-induction of troops within the
Mission area commenced on November 6, 2000. During the month
of November, 506 personnel were de-inducted from Daru and
Kenema for onward movement to Hastings. Under Phase I, 1409
troops are scheduled to return to India between December 6 and 24.
The first passenger flight with 300 troops reached New Delhi on
December 8. The remaining 186 troops will be returning to India,
under phase II, commencing in the first week of January. It is expected
that the entire deinduction of Indian troops from Sierra Leone will
be completed by mid-February 2001.
Following Indias decision to withdraw its contingent from
UNAMSIL, de-induction under Phase I, has been completed on
December 26, 2000. 1442 Indian troops returned to India during this

Annual Report 2000-2001

phase. The remaining 1621 personnel are scheduled to be de-inducted,
under Phase II, during the period January 26 to February 11, 2001.
UNIFIL (Lebanon)

UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established in 1978
after Israels occupation of Southern Lebanon. India has provided an
infantry battalion comprising 619 ranks since November 1998.
During the year, India contributed additional 172 troops to strengthen
the Indian battalion. India also provided the services of Brig. G.
Athmanathan for the post of Deputy Force Commander to UNIFIL.
Lt. General R.K. Sawhney, Deputy Chief of Army Staff, visited
Lebanon from August 28 to 30, 2000 to meet the Indian contingent
and to assess the situation on ground after the withdrawal of Israeli
Defence Forces from former Israeli Controller Area of South
Lebanon. Although there have been sporadic incidents of violence
between the Israeli Defence Forces and the Hizbollah group, the
Indian soldiers are safe and doing well.
Since November 1998, India has contributed an Infantry
Battalion to the UN Mission in Lebanon and the rotation of troops
takes place every six months. During the month of December,
rotation of 615 Indian troops was completed. At present 791 Indian
troops are deployed in UNIFIL.
UNMIK (Kosovo)

India has contributed 300 civilian police officers and has deployed
two companies, comprising 240 personnel, of Rapid Action Force
(CRPF) to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). In
addition, about 30 Indian civil servants have also joined the Interim
Civil Administration on deputation to UNMIK.
A three-member composite delegation from MHA, MEA and
CRPF, led by Dr. T. N. Mishra, DG, CRPF, visited Kosovo from
November 6 to 10, 2000 to meet the RAF personnel and Civilian
Police Officers. The delegation interacted with senior officials of the
UNMIK Administration to assess the local situation following the
municipal elections in Kosovo and Presidential elections in Serbia.

India has contributed 300 Civilian Police Officers and has
deployed two companies of Rapid Action Force (CRPF), comprising
240 personnel, to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).
During the month, 85 CIVPOL Officers returned to India after
completion of one year tenure on December 8, and, in replacement,
60 CIVPOL officers left for Kosovo. From the RAF, 160 personnel
were rotated on December 23/24, as per guidelines of the UN. Earlier
in November, a three-member delegation from MHA, CRPF and
MEA had visited Kosovo, and interacted with the senior officials of
UNMIK Administration, apart from meetings with the RAF and
CIVPOL officers. The Indian contingent has a high reputation of
discipline and professionalism in Kosovo.
UNMEE (Ethiopia & Eritrea)

The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1312 on July 31,
2000 authorizing establishment of the UN Mission in Ethiopia and
Eritrea (UNMEE). The Government has conveyed its decision to
the UN to participate in this peacekeeping Mission and would be
providing an Infantry Battalion, a Force Reserve Company and a
Construction Engineering Company, in addition to some Military
Observers.
The UNMEE deployment is continuing in accordance with a
three-phase concept of operations. The establishment of Military
Liaison Offices in each capital (Asmara and Addis Ababa) under Phase
I has been completed. The establishment of UN Mission in Ethiopia
and Eritrea with military observers and civilian support staff in
anticipation of a peacekeeping operation is continuing. So far India
has contributed five Military Observers and two Staff Officers to
UNMEE. Deployment of a peacekeeping force within UNMEE up
to 4,200 troops (including 220 Military Observers) is likely to
commence in the month of December, with the arrival of Dutch and
Danish contingents.
A 6-member Indian recce team led by Major General G.S. Negi,
Addl. DG, SD Directorate, Army Headquarters visited Eritrea and
Ethiopia from December 2 to 9 to survey the area, before deployment
of Indian troops.

Following Indias commitment to participate in the UN
Peacekeeping Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), a 6-member
Indian recce team led by Major General G.S. Negi, Addl. DG, SD
Directorate, Army Headquarters visited Eritrea and Ethiopia from
December 2 to 9 to survey the area, before deployment of Indian
troops. The team has submitted its recommendations for the
deployment of a Force Reserve Company and an Engineer
Construction Company by February 2001 and an Indian Infantry
Battalion in the month of June 2001, to replace the Netherlands
contingent. India has already deployed 5 Military Observers and 2
Logistic Staff Officers to UNMEE.

strategic analysis capacity of the UN should be strengthened, as also
its capacity to assist in transitional civil administration. It had also
suggested that the headquarters staff in the Department of Peace
Keeping Operations be strengthened.

Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNP)United Nations and
International Organisations

The Indian delegation played an active role both within the NonAligned Movement (NAM) and in the C-34 to ensure that our
concerns as a developing country, and more importantly, as a troop
contributing country (TCC) were fully reflected. A notable success
from our point of view, was that our concerns on consultations with
TCCs and on participation in briefings to the Council when changes
to a missions mandate and other issues which have implications for
the missions use of force were contemplated, were all fully reflected
in the final outcome.

The establishment of Centre for UN Peacekeeping was formally
inaugurated during a Peacekeeping Seminar organised by the United
Service Institution of India (USI) from September 13-15, 2000. It is
initially envisaged to organise one seminar and two training capsules
a year, under the aegis of USI. The aim of the Centre is to meet part
of the UN related training requirements of India and friendly foreign
countries; promote comprehensive research and intellectual exchange.
Brahimi Report

In March 2000, UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, had
commissioned a panel under the chairmanship of Lakhdar Brahimi,
former Foreign Minister of Algeria, to undertake a thorough review
of the UN peace and security activities and to present a clear set of
specific, concrete and practical recommendations to assist the UN in
conducting peace keeping operations. The report of the panel - the
Brahimi Report was submitted to the Millennium Summit and formed
the basis of discussions both in the Security Council and the Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. The Brahimi panel had,
inter alia, recommended that the UN should engage more actively in
conflict prevention, undertake multidimensional peace building as a
part of peace keeping operations, that the information gathering and

Extraordinary Session of the Special Committee on Peace
Keeping Operations(C-34)

After 5 weeks of intensified and protracted discussions, on 5
December the Special Committee on Peace Keeping Operations
adopted a comprehensive report on the whole question of Peace
Keeping Operations, drawing on recommendations of the Brahimi
Report.

Security Council consideration of measures to improve UN
Peace Keeping Operations

On 13 November, the Security Council unanimously adopted
resolution 1327 outlining measures to give UN Peace Keeping
Operations clear, credible and achievable mandates. The resolution
draws on the recommendations of the Brahimi Report, and inter alia
included calls for regular military briefings on key aspects of peace
keeping operations including chain of command, force structure and
risk assessment, humanitarian situation as also strengthening
consultations with TCCs. The resolution also underscored the
Security Councils commitment to ensuring that the tasks endorsed
to peace keeping operations are appropriate to the situation on the
ground, including such factors as prospects for success, potential need

Annual Report 2000-2001

to protect civilians or the possibility that some parties may seek to
undermine peace through violence. The resolution further states
that the rules of engagement must clearly set out the circumstances
in which force can be used. UN Secretary General has been entrusted
with the task of preparing a comprehensive operational doctrine for
the military component of peace keeping operations. On the issue of
improving the UNs capacity to deploy personnel rapidly, the Security
Council has entrusted the Secretary General with the task of
consulting potential and current TCCs on how to achieve this.
Security Council Debate on Exit Strategies for UNPKOs

On 15 th November, the Security Council debated the issue of
when and how to terminate UN Peace Keeping Operations. This
debate was organised at the initiative of Netherlands, which held the
Presidency of the Security Council for the month of November.
The objective of the debate was to ensure that Peace Keeping
Operations are terminated only when there is a clear and effective
strategy to ensure sustained peace and development after the exit of
peacekeepers. Over 34 countries participated in the debate, including
all the 15 members of the Council. The debate covered a wide range
of critical issues related to Security Council decision making on
mission closure and mission transition, as also on importance of
conflict prevention, need to understand underlying causes and the
value of ensuring smooth transition from peace keeping to peace
building. In our intervention in the debate, we called for greater clarity
and definition of the mandate of Peace Keeping Operations, adherence
to universally agreed norms such as neutrality, impartiality etc., in
determining troop contributing countries, the need for peace keeping
force levels to be commensurate with their mandate and
responsibilities, need to distinguish between peace keeping operations
and humanitarian relief operations, need to consult the TCCs, etc.

Decolonisation

As a founding member of the Special Committee on the Situation
with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting
of Independence to the Colonial countries and Peoples (C-24), India

continued to play a useful and constructive role within the
Committee. The 40 th anniversary of the Declaration was
commemorated by the UNGA in December. The relationship
between the Administering Powers and the Committee continued
to improve considerably over the year and as a result a concrete
programme of work was developed in consultation with the
Administering Powers with respect of each non-self-governing
territory. The General Assembly further mandated 2001-2010 as a
second International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. India
participated in the regional Seminar on Decolonisation held in
Marshall Islands in May as a member of the official delegation of the
Special Committee.
Terrorism

At the 55th UNGA, the Working Group of the Sixth Committee
in pursuance of a decision taken at the 54th UNGA, held its first
round of detailed discussions on the draft Comprehensive Convention
on International Terrorism at the UN from September 25 to October
6, 2000.
The progress so far in the first round of discussions on the Draft
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the
Working Group of the Sixth Committee from September 25 
October 6, 2000 reflected the seriousness with which the international
community approached the issue. The considerable support received
from a wide range of countries, including G-8, European Union, as
also Asian, African and Latin American countries, on several of the
issues of concern to India was a matter of satisfaction. These included
the need for the convention to address the question of state
responsibility to refrain from acts of terrorism and to ensure that
their respective territories are not used for terrorist installations and
training camps, along with a responsibility of states to either prosecute
or extradite.
Among the issues on which more work needed to be done in
bridging differences included the questions of asylum, extradition

exclusion of security forces from the purview of the Convention,
political exception clause, and a definition of terrorism.
Discussions on the Draft Convention will resume early next year.
India will continue to work actively for the early adoption of this
comprehensive convention on terrorism.
Discussions in UN Security Council

On December 7, 2000, the UN Security Council discussed the
issue of international terrorism and international cooperation under
agenda item Role of the Security Council in Maintenance of
International Security. This discussion was a follow up to resolution
1269 adopted by the Council on 19 October 1999, when the Security
Council, for the first time, addressed the general issue of international
terrorism as a threat to international peace and security.
Following the debate, the Security Council adopted a Presidential
Statement, which, inter alia, expressed deep concern at the increase
in acts of terrorism in many regions of the world, reiterated its
condemnation of these acts, irrespective of their motive, called for
universal accession to existing anti-terrorism conventions and
reiterated the Security Councils readiness to take necessary steps in
accordance with its responsibility under the UN Charter to counter
terrorist threats to international peace and security.

greater appreciation of Indias security concerns and its responsible
conduct and policies. Harmonisation of Indias national imperatives
and security obligations with international concerns on nonproliferation and disarmament also progressed steadily.
On the regional level, Indias participation in the confidence and
security building process and structures under the ASEAN Regional
Forum acquired greater momentum. India was also actively involved
in similar processes underway in the Conference on Interaction and
Security Building Measures in Asia.
Regular contact was maintained with key international and nongovernmental organisations active in the field of disarmament with a
view to keeping them appropriately informed about the Indian
perspectives on disarmament issues. Parliament was kept regularly
informed of all developments.
A new Permanent Mission of India to the Conference on
Disarmament was established in Geneva on 16 September 2000 with
Shri Rakesh Sood assuming charge as the first Ambassador/PR for
Disarmament. He presented his credentials on 19 September to Mr.
V. Petrovsky, Secretary General of the Conference on Disarmament.
United Nations General Assembly

Indias commitment to non-discriminatory and universal nuclear
disarmament continued to be reflected in its policy pronouncements
and diplomatic initiatives. The countrys stand on issues related to
disarmament and international security in various multilateral and
regional forums was premised on Indias national security interests
and the nations tradition of close engagement with the international
community.

India continued to play an active role on disarmament issues in
the First Committee of the 55th UN Millennium General Assembly.
India is the only nuclear weapon State that believes that its security
would be enhanced in a nuclear-weapons-free-world. With this
commitment to global nuclear disarmament, it continued to press
for negotiations on a Nuclear Weapons Convention that will prohibit
forever the development, production, stockpiling, use or threat of
use nuclear weapons, and provide for the elimination of all existing
weapons under international verification.

The series of bilateral dialogues commenced after may 1998
continued to be pursued this year. New security dialogues were also
initiated with China, Germany and UK. All these have resulted in

India has clearly and categorically stated its policy of no-first-use
of nuclear weapons. However, the doctrines of first use of nuclear
weapons have persisted, and, in fact, are being re-validated and

reaffirmed. There is need for the international community to take
decisive steps to de-legitimize nuclear weapons. Indias resolution on
Convention on the Prohibition of the use of Nuclear Weapons called
for a multilateral agreement prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons,
which will also contribute to a positive climate for negotiations leading
to the elimination of nuclear weapons. It was adopted with the support
of 109 countries.

(NSAs), re-appointment of Special Coordinators dealing with a ban
on transfer of Anti-Personnel Landmines (APLs), Transparency in
Armaments (TIAs) and procedural reform issues relating to the CD.
India, along with a number of other countries including in the Group
of 21, remained actively engaged in the work of the CD and efforts
to reach a consensus on its Programme of Work.

In 1998, India had introduced its resolution Reducing Nuclear
Danger, which calls for the review of nuclear doctrines and immediate
and urgent steps to reduce the risk of unintentional and accidental
use of nuclear weapons. This resolution, for which the co-sponsorship
and the support is growing, was adopted this year with 110 countries
voting in favour.

The 2000 Substantive Session of the UNDC took place in New
York from 26 June - 27 July 2000. It addressed two new issues Ways and Means to Achieve Nuclear Disarmament and Practical
Confidence-building Measures in the Field of Conventional Arms.
These were discussed in their respective Working Groups in the first
year of a three-year cycle of deliberations. These substantive topics
were discussed in-depth, including in the NAM Working Group on
Disarmament. India made a positive and constructive contribution
to the discussions.

Indias resolution on Role of Science and Technology in the
Context of International Security and Disarmament, highlighting
the qualitative aspects of the arms race, and the need for a genuinely
multilateral and non-discriminatory response, was adopted with the
support of 97 countries.
India was actively involved in the deliberations on a number of
other important resolutions in the First Committee. It co-sponsored
a Malaysian resolution reaffirming the validity of the 1996 Advisory
Opinion of the International Court of Justice that called on all nuclear
weapon states to work towards nuclear disarmament. It also voted in
favour of a Russian resolution seeking to preserve the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile Treaty currently threatened by US plans to build a
national missile defence system.
Conference on Disarmament

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) could not undertake any
substantive negotiations during its 2000 annual session in the absence
of adoption of its Programme of Work due to lack of consensus on
two issues. These were Nuclear Disarmament and Prevention of an
Arms Race in Outer Space. The areas on which consensus existed
included re-establishment of the Ad-hoc Committees on Fissile
Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT), Negative Security Assurances

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

The 44th General Conference (GC) of the IAEA was held from
18 - 22nd September 2000, in Vienna. The Indian delegation was led
by Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission.
The Indian delegation worked with like-minded delegations within
and outside the Group of 77 to ensure that the recommendations of
the GC supported the IAEA activities in the field of nuclear energy.
India also endeavoured to maintain a balanced approach in the GC
resolution on safeguards for all the Member States of the Agency
without discrimination.
th

On the issue of financing of technical cooperation, the major
donors sought a freeze on contributions to IAEAs voluntary
Technical Cooperation Fund at the present levels, whereas the
developing countries of G-77 sought a significant increase. Financing
of safeguards was tagged with the concept of shielding, as the
developing countries sought economic relief from increased costs due
to the comprehensive safeguards measures under the NPT. The
89

United Nations and International Organisations

eventual phasing out of shielding over some 28 years, with member
states placed under four slabs, was accepted.
India, alongwith the G-77, succeeded in getting the Nuclear
Technology Review placed as an agenda item for the 44th GC in
September 2000.
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)

On 29 April 2000, the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) completed the third year of its existence.
As an original State Party to the CWC, India has been discharging
the various obligations assumed by it. It has taken effective measures
to meet all the targets and timelines envisaged in the Convention.
Since the entry into force of this Convention, the Technical Secretariat
of the OPCW has conducted more than 700 inspections at chemical
weapons storage facilities, former production facilities and industrial
plant sites in States Parties to the Convention. More than 40 such
inspections have been smoothly conducted in India. As a member of
the Executive Council since its inception, India has been playing an
active role in the deliberations of the Council to oversee the nondiscriminatory implementation by States Parties of all obligations
assumed under the CWC. As required by the CWC, India completed
procedures for national implementation measures with the
notification of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act on 28th August
2000, thereby providing statutory powers for the National Authority
in implementing the Convention.
The absence of progress in implementing key provisions of the
Convention relating to international co-operation continues to be
addressed by India, along with other member states, as a matter of
concern.
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC)

India actively participated in the work of the Ad-hoc Group of
States Parties to the BTWC in Geneva during 2000 to negotiate a
Protocol on the basis of the agreed mandate. The Indian delegation
continued to support strengthening of BTWC through an effective
90

Protocol containing a balance of security and developmental
obligations, including the unimpeded exchange and transfer of biotechnology for peaceful purposes, creating a non-discriminatory and
transparent compliance regime.
Outer Space Affairs

The 37th Session of the Scientific & Technical Sub-Committee,
the 39th Session of the Legal Sub-Committee and the 43rd Session of
the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space
(UNCOPUOS) took place during the year. At the Scientific &
Technical Sub-Committee meeting, India proposed a phased task plan
for implementing space-based integrated natural disaster management
system. The Legal Sub-Committee deliberated upon the status of the
International Treaties governing use of Outer Space, definition and
delimitation of Outer Space, use of nuclear power sources in Outer
Space, and the concept of the Launching State. The main
recommendation adopted at the 43rd Session of the UNCOPUOS
was for a three-year plan on space-based disaster management system.
United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised
Crime

The Ad-hoc Committee on the elaboration of the Convention
against Transnational Organised Crime held its 11th Session in Vienna
from 2 - 28 October 2000. The Firearms Protocol, being negotiated
under this, contained contentious provisions on self-determination,
definition, scope, criminalisation and marking of firearms. The
Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee established working groups for
the conclusion of the Protocol and suggested a compromise package
deal. The Indian delegation made a constructive contribution to the
negotiations on the Firearms Protocol with a view to engender suitable
transparency and accountability in international and national practices
in the field of firearms. However, no conclusion could be reached.
As the Firearms Protocol is linked to the topic of small arms and
light weapons, its failure could affect the International Conference
on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,
scheduled to take place in July 2001. India has been actively involved
in the preparatory process for this Conference.

Annual Report 2000-2001
Exports Control

After the nuclear tests in May 1998, India had declared that, as a
responsible nuclear weapons State, it had a stake in preventing
proliferation and would make its system of export controls more
stringent where necessary, including by expanding control lists of
equipment and technology to make them more effective and
contemporary. This was duly done through an inter-ministerial
review, and the recommendations were given effect through the
EXIM Policy announced on 1st April 2000. A new Special Chemicals,
Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technology (SCOMET) List
replaced the earlier SMET List.
A six-member delegation from the US Department of State visited
India from 7 -10 August 2000 to prepare a joint programme in the
areas of export licensing and enforcement. An enforcement workshop
was organized in Mumbai from 18-22 September 2000 with focus on
investigation, case development and prosecution with involvement
of customs officials, instructors from the National Academy of
Customs, Excise & Narcotics (NACEN), and working level officers.
After the visit, the US side was able to better appreciate the strengths
of Indias export control system. An Indian delegation similarly visited
the US in October 2000. A Train the Trainers programme was also
held at NACEN in December 2000. The objective of the programme
was to create awareness about the dangers of unauthorised trade in
dual purpose chemicals/items, and techniques to stem the same.
Deliberations with MTCR delegation

An MTCR delegation led by Ambassador PekJka Ojanen from
Finland, and comprising representatives from France and Canada
visited New Delhi in December 2000 to present the MTCR proposal
for a Draft International Code of Conduct against ballistic missile
proliferation. The Indian delegation explained the problems posed
by the underlying basis of MTCR, which amalgamated peaceful space
technology with ballistic missile proliferation. An expose was
provided to the visiting delegation on Indias endeavour to
indigenously develop all aspects of its space technology programme

as a categorical imperative for socio-economic development. The
Indian delegation expressed its clear preference for an open,
multilateral and non-discriminatory approach to address the issue of
ballistic missile proliferation.
Convention on Prohibition or Restrictions on the Use of
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)

The CCW - Second Annual Conference of Amended Protocol 11 was held in Geneva in December 2000. The Indian delegation
made a statement emphasising Indias consistent stand on maintaining
a moratorium on exports of landmines and reaffirming that India
views the current humanitarian crisis as a consequence of irresponsible
transfers and indiscriminate use. India no longer produces nondetectable landmines and has extensively participated in UNsponsored mine clearance and rehabilitation programme.
UN Conference on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light
Weapons

The 2nd Prepcom for the UN Conference on Illicit Trade in
Small Arms and Light Weapons began in New York from 8 January,
2001. India has a strong interest in this issue in view of the disastrous
impact of illicit trafficking in small arms on society at large and the
absence of international norms to identify and apportion
responsibility as part of overall transparency for such trafficking on
the State or non-State actors concerned.
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)

The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Inter-sessional Support
Group meeting on Confidence Building Measures (ISG on CBMs)
was held in Singapore from 3 -7 April 2000. Officials from Ministry
of External Affairs and Ministry of Defence participated. The meeting
was preceded by an Experts Group Meeting (EGM) on Transnational
Crime. The meeting discussed three issues which were identified by
the ARF Ministers last year, namely, anti-piracy, illicit trafficking in
small arms, and illegal migration. Another ISG on CBMs was held in
Seoul from 1-7 November 2000, also preceded by an EGM on
Transnational Crime.
91

United Nations and International Organisations

The 7th ARF was held in Bangkok from 26 -27 July 2000. EAM
led Indias delegation. The meeting discussed broad issues affecting
the security of the Asia Pacific region. DPRK was admitted as a
member to the Forum. There was a consensus at this meeting that
the Forum should now enter a phase of consolidation rather than
expansion. EAM met several of his counterparts on the margins of
the ARF. He also participated in a meeting to discuss the Mekong
Ganga Suvanna Phum (Suvarnabhoomi) Cooperation Programme.
The initiative was enthusiastically endorsed by the participants
(Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and India).
An ARF Workshop on Anti-Piracy was organised by the Indian
Coast Guard in collaboration with MEA and MoD on 18-20 October
2000 at Mumbai. Delegations from most ARF countries participated
in this Workshop, which was highly commended by all.

Non-Aligned Movement
The Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement met in
Cartagena, Colombia, from 8-9 April 2000. The meeting assumed
special significance since it preceded the Millennium Summit and
Millennium Assembly of the UN General Assembly.
EAM, Shri Jaswant Singh, led the high level Indian delegation.
In his statement at the meeting, EAM reiterated the relevance and
importance of NAM and, stressing the need for NAM to avoid any
issues that would divide or distract the Movement, also exhorted the
NAM members to commit themselves to democratic norms.
The developments at the meeting of significance from the Indian
point of view included a strong condemnation of the Taliban. On
Terrorism, the Communiqué reiterated support for the Indian
proposal for adoption of a Comprehensive Convention on
International Terrorism. NAM also maintained its position, first
expressed during the NAM Foreign Ministers meeting in New York,
September 1999, categorically rejecting the concept of the right of
Humanitarian Intervention. The Communiqué also included a call
for restoration of constitutional legality in States whose governments
92

had come to power through unconstitutional means and further
recommended that this issue be considered by the Movement at its
next Summit.

Social, Human Rights and Humanitarian Issues
India participated constructively in the meetings of the UN
Commission on Human Rights, its Sub-Commission on Promotion
and Protection of Human Rights and discussions on human rights
and related questions in the Economic and Social Council as also the
UN General Assembly. Indias participation in these forums was
guided by its stature as the largest democracy, its developing country
status and its commitment to the rule of law, promotion and
protection of human rights, and an open and transparent society.
India reaffirmed the principles of universality and indivisibility of
human rights and sought to promote greater understanding among
peoples and a culture of tolerance and pluralism. India also called for
de-politicisation of the human rights debate; and for strengthening
of cooperation, dialogue and national capacity building as the most
effective means of promoting human rights. Developments related
to standard settings in the field of human rights were closely
monitored.
India participated actively in the 56 th annual session of the
Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva from March 20 to
April 28, 2000. The Indian delegation contributed significantly to
the deliberations in the Commission by engaging pro-actively on
substantive issues as also by building consensus, cutting across
entrenched positions. The delegation was guided by Indias
commitment to the universality of human rights and their promotion
and protection without politicisation, as also Indias stature as a
democratic and pluralistic society. India continued with its policy of
calling for an end to politicisation and confrontation.
India co-sponsored 26 resolutions during the 56th Session of the
Commission. India moved its biennial resolution on Tolerance and
Pluralism as Indivisible Elements in the Promotion and Protection

Annual Report 2000-2001

of Human Rights which was adopted without a vote with 60 cosponsors from both developed and developing countries. India jointly
sponsored with Germany a resolution on Advisory Services and
Technical Co-operation of the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights which attracted 50 co-sponsors from both developed
and developing countries and was adopted without a vote. India also
worked closely with the sponsors of the resolutions on Promoting
and Consolidating Democracy, the Role of Good Governance in
the Promotion of Human Rights, Human Rights and Terrorism
and the resolution on the Situation of Human Rights in Afghanistan.
In accordance with the long-standing policy of being against selectivity
and politicisation, India voted against country-specific resolutions
on situation of human rights in Cuba, Iran and Chechnya (Russian

issues such as tackling of widespread abject poverty and deprivation
around the globe, enhancement of the capacities of developing

Annual Report 2000-2001

countries, the link between humanitarian assistance and long term
development; and combating forces of bigotry; and hatred as crucial
inputs to any preventive strategy.

Environment and Sustainable Development Issues
The eighth session of the UN Commission on Sustainable
Development was held in New York from April 24 to May 5, 2000
and addressed issues relating to agriculture, land resources, trade and
financial resources in the context of sustainable development. The
Indian delegation, led by Shri T.R. Baalu, Minister of Environment
& Forests, emphasised the crucial need for food security in developing
countries as well as the role of sustained growth in agriculture,
including through the application of suitable technologies, to reduce
poverty. India referred to the need for an open, non-discriminatory
and equitable multilateral trading system as well as reform of the
international financial architecture so as to ensure broader
participation by developing countries in decision-making processes.
Shri Baalu also drew attention to the lack of fulfilment by developed
countries of commitments made at the United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to
transfer technology and to provide new and additional financial
resources to the developing countries for achieving sustainable
development.
At the 55th General Assembly, India continued to play an active
role in the Second Committee of the 54 th GA which examined a
range of macro-economic, environmental and development issues.
The most important resolution under the environment cluster was
the 10-year review of programmes in the implementation of the
outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment &
Development. It was decided that the 10-year review meeting would
be a Summit level meeting, called the World Summit on Sustainable
Development. It would be hosted by South Africa in 2002 and would
be preceded by a final substantive preparatory session to be held at
Ministerial level in May 2002 in Indonesia.

The Hague Conference on Climate Change

The VI Session of the Conference of Parties of the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in The Hague
from November 13 to 25. As Parties could not reach agreement on
the modalities of implementing Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol
and other related matters, the Conference was suspended by its
President, Mr. Jan Pronk, Minister of Environment and Spatial
Planning of the Netherlands and is to resume in May 2001. The main
disagreement centred around inclusion of activities related to landuse change and forestry in domestic action by developed countries
and in the Clean Development Mechanism. India continued to be
the coordinator and spokesman of the Group of 77 and China on
the Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.
The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) considered
the establishment of a United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF)
within the UN System. It was agreed that UNFF would have a
universal membership and would be a subsidiary body of ECOSOC
operating under the rules and procedures of functional commissions.
It would thus work within the framework of the inter-governmental
process to which India subscribes.
Shri Babu Lal Marandi, MOS for Environment & Forests
participated in the Ministerial Round Table of the Fifth meeting of
the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological
Diversity, in Nairobi on 23rd May, 2000 and in the special signing
ceremony on 24th May, 2000 which was organised to enable Parties

on Agricultural Bio-diversity, by ensuring that the recommendations
95

United Nations and International Organisations

of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological
Advice on Genetic Use Restriction Technologies were incorporated
in the final decisions. Indian concerns for formulating legal measures
in user and recipient countries, in respect of Access and Benefit
Sharing, to ensure equitable sharing of benefits, were widely
recognised. India also succeeded in making recommendations for
mandatory disclosure in the patent application of the country of origin
of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge use in
the development of an invention.
India participated in the 11th Conference of Parties (COP 11) to
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Nairobi, 10-20 April 2000. Apart
from the official delegation, an NGO contingent from India also
attended the conference. India co-sponsored the resolution on
Elephants with Kenya and successfully managed to get the ban
imposed on the ivory trade extended for another 2 years till the next

perspectives were given primacy and incorporated in the Hyderabad
Declaration.

Development Issues
The UN Millennium Declaration adopted at the conclusion of
the Millennium Summit of the Heads of State and Government held
in New York from September 6 to 8 recognised that the central
challenge is to ensure that globalisation becomes a positive force for
all the worlds people. The Declaration states that while globalisation
offers great opportunities, its benefits are very unevenly shared at
present, while its costs are unevenly distributed. It also recognises
that developing countries and countries with economies in transition
face special difficulties in responding to the central challenge of
globalisation. Only through broad and sustained efforts to create a

Annual Report 2000-2001

shared future, based upon common humanity in all its diversity, can
globalisation be made fully inclusive and equitable. These efforts must
include policies and measures at the global level, which correspond
to the needs of developing countries and economies in transition,
and are formulated and implemented with their effective participation.
The first ever Summit of the Group of 77 (the South Summit)
was held from April 10-14, 2000 in Havana. Apart from the intensively
negotiated Declaration and the Programme of Action, the Summit
also adopted Other Decisions as the output of the interactive session
between Heads of State and Government. The Indian delegation was
led by the Minister for Human Resource Development, Dr. Murali
Manohar Joshi. India participated actively in the preparatory process
for the finalisation of the Declaration and Programme of Action of
the South Summit. Both the Declaration and the Programme of
Action refer to democracy, the former stressing a commitment to
promote democracy and to strengthen the rule of law.
Under the macroeconomic agenda items, the Second Committee
of the General Assembly, by endorsing the resolution of the
Preparatory Committee of Financing for Development on
Preparations for the substantive preparatory process and the highlevel international inter-governmental event on Financing for
Development, decided to postpone the proposed event till the first
quarter of 2002. India had been co-chairman of the Working Group
in 1999 and continued to underscore the need for making the process
viable and meaningful.
The first substantive session of the preparatory committee of the
High Level Inter-Governmental Event on Financing for Development
was held in New York from 30 May-2 June 2000. It adopted a
comprehensive resolution, which included a tentative preliminary
agenda. India was able to include in the agenda a clear reference to
the problems of developing countries. The 55th General Assembly
decided that this event would be held in the first quarter of 2002.
The resolution adopted by the 55th session of the UN General
Assembly on the Role of the United Nations in promoting
development in the context of globalisation and interdependence

called on the international community to promote international
development co-operation aimed at enhancing growth, stability,
equity and the participation of developing countries in the globalising
world economy through appropriate measures, including support
for structural and macroeconomic reform, foreign direct investment,
enhanced official development assistance, capacity building and
dissemination of knowledge and technology. Similarly, the General
Assembly resolution on The implementation of the First United
Nations Decade for Eradication of Poverty called on all countries
to formulate and implement time-bound programmes for achieving
the target set out in the Millennium Summit Declaration of halving
by 2015 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty and in
this context emphasised the need for strengthening of international
assistance to developing countries in their efforts to alleviate poverty
by creating an enabling international environment. Both resolutions
were actively supported by India.
The substantive session of the UN Economic and Social Council
was held in New York from July 5 to August 1, 2000. A Ministerial
Declaration was issued at the conclusion of the discussions on the
theme for the High-Level Segment Development and International
Co-operation in the 21 st Century: The Role of Information
Technology in the knowledge based economy. Indias experience
in the utilisation of Information and Communications Technology
was praised by several speakers. India also hosted an Asian Regional
Meeting to prepare for these discussions.
56th Annual Session of ESCAP, 1-7 June 2000

The 56th Annual Session of Economic and Social Council for
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) was held in Bangkok from 1-7 June

Social Council. In all, 27 member countries of ESCAP participated
in the meeting. At the Conference, the problems and issues faced by
countries in the region in terms of readiness for the digital era were
addressed and awareness about these issues was promoted and
enhanced. The declaration adopted at the conclusion of the meeting
served as a valuable input for the discussions in the high-level segment
of the Economic and Social Council.
Centre for International Crime Prevention (CICP)

The 10 th UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the
Treatment of Offenders was held in Vienna from April 10-17, 2000.

Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-First Century. At Indias
initiative, a reference to terrorism was included in the document along
with the commitment of Member States to do their utmost to foster
universal adherence to the international instruments concerned with
the fight against terrorism.
The Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of the
Comprehensive Convention against Transnational organised crime
continued to work in Vienna during the year on the draft Convention
and its three associated Protocols. The Ad Hoc Committee held its
11th Session from October 2-28. The texts of the Convention and the
98

Protocols on trafficking in persons and on trafficking in migrants
were finalised by the Committee and recommended for adoption.
The Committee was unable to agree on the text of the Protocol on
Firearms. The diplomatic Conference held in Palermo from
December 12-15 provided an opportunity for Member States to sign
the Convention and the two agreed Protocols. Negotiations on the
text of the Protocol on Firearms were resumed in February 2001.
International Criminal Court

The Preparatory Commission (prepcom) of the International
Criminal Court met from 27 November to 3rd December 2000. 139
countries have now signed the Statute of the ICC, while 27 have
ratified it. 60 ratifications are needed for the formal establishment of
the Court. The prepcom considered a range of essentially house
keeping and administrative matters including financial regulations,
budget, a relationship agreement between the Court and the UN
Security Council, as also principles governing the headquarters
agreements between the Court and Netherlands, where the Court
will be located. In addition, there was some debate on the item Crime
of aggression, whose definition is still under negotiation. The next
session of the prepcom is scheduled to begin in February. The Court,
which is to be a permanent judicial body, will have the authority to
investigate and bring to justice individuals who commit most serious
crimes of concern to the international community such as genocide,
war crimes and crimes against humanity.
HIV/AIDS

India participated in informal negotiations to convene a Special
Session of the United Nations in 2001 devoted to the issue of HIV/
AIDS, in all its aspects. India was able to ensure that concerns like
access to drugs and treatment, co-infections, poverty, the social and
economic impact of HIV/AIDS, and the stigma attached to the
disease, were adequately reflected in the resolution adopted by the
General Assembly.
India continued under the umbrella of the Group of 77, to pilot
the resolution on International Co-operation in Humanitarian

Annual Report 2000-2001

Assistance on Natural Disasters from relief to development. This
resolution reaffirms the Guiding Principles of humanitarian assistance,
recognises the importance of the principles of neutrality, humanity
and impartiality of humanitarian assistance; stresses that humanitarian
assistance in the field of natural disasters should be provided in
accordance with and with due respect for the Guiding Principles and
calls for innovative mechanisms to ensure timely and adequate natural
disaster response. India continued to voice its opposition to the
concept of humanitarian intervention and reiterated the necessity
for full respect to the Guiding Principles of Humanitarian Assistance.
In the spirit of solidarity, India also co-sponsored several resolutions
under this agenda item.

Administrative, Budgetary and Financial Issues
The focus of discussions in the Fifth Committee of the 55th
session of the UN General Assembly was on the methodology for
the scale of assessments for the regular budget, where the US wanted
a reduction of the ceiling from 25% to 22% as a precondition for the
settlement of its arrears. This proved to be the most complex and the
hardest item of the agenda at the 55th session. Negotiations continued
till the very end of the regular session and an agreement on the
methodology for both the regular scale and the peace-keeping scale
was finally concluded only on December 24. With the agreed revision
of the methodology, India would be assessed at 0.343, 0.344 and 0.341
per cent for the regular budget for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003
respectively. India was active in the discussions on both scales and
Indias constructive role in the negotiations was highly acclaimed by
the President of the 55th General Assembly, the Chairman of the
Fifth Committee and other key delegations from both the developing
and the developed countries. As a major troop contributing country,
vitally interested in timely reimbursements to member States who
participate in peacekeeping operations, India continued to pursue
the matter of reimbursements with the UN. During the year, India
received payments of $ 12.07 million from the UN for participation

in peacekeeping operations. As of end October 2000, the United
Nations owed India US $ 84 million.
Operational Acitivities of the UN System/UN Funds and
Programmes

The Second Committee of the 55th session of the United Nations
General Assembly discussed Operational Activities for Development
of the United Nations, Science & Technology for Development and
Globalisation and Inter-dependence with special reference to
information and communication technologies. India highlighted its
commitment to Operational Activities for Development of the UN
System and stressed the developmental mandate of the United
Nations. On the issue of Science & Technology, India stressed the
need for review of Trade Related Intellectual Property Services and
for promoting transfer of technologies to developing countries. On
the issue of globalisation and inter-dependence, India highlighted the
need to ensure that globalisation benefits all. India also stressed the
need to consider all elements of globalisation, and not simply view it
as a process of greater integration of financial flows.
India continued to play a significant and constructive role in the
work of the UN Funds and Programmes. As a member of the
Executive Boards of the UNDP/UNFPA and UNICEF, India
ensured that the these organisations continued to focus on their
primary mandate to assist developing countries in their efforts,
pursuant to their national development plans and priorities, for
sustainable human development, in particular, through projects
directed at eradication of poverty; upliftment of women and ensuring
better reproductive health services; and, the needs of children. India
saw to it that the Results Oriented Annual Reports did not become
an element of introducing conditionalities in the programmes of UN
Funds and did not detract from the basic principle of nationallydriven programming.
The India-UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)
was presented at a joint meeting of all Executive Boards by Indias
Planning Commission and won high praise for its conceptual
99

United Nations and International Organisations

orientation and identification of two priority areas, namely, gender
empowerment and decentralisation. India participated actively at the
first Ministerial Level Meeting of UNDP to consider its future role
and funding, organised by UNDP in September 2000 in New York.
Prominent visitors from the operational agencies to India included
Dr. Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of UNFPA who visited India in
September 2000. India maintained its voluntary contributions to the
UN Funds and Programmes, emerging as the largest contributor from
within the developing nations to UNDP and amongst the five largest
of UNFPA, UNICEF Annual Food Programme. New resident
representatives to India were nominated by UNICEF (Ms. Maria
Rosaria Calivis) and UNFPA ( Mr. Francois Farah) during the year.
The annual session of the UNICEF Executive Board was held in
New York from 22-26 May 2000. The session had a particular
importance, as its inputs were to feed into the Preparatory Committee
for the World Summit for Children. India stressed the need for
continued and prompt supply of polio vaccines; continued focus on
immunisation against other communicable diseases; the need to focus
on adolescence; and the need to concentrate on international action
to combat malnutrition and provide adequate safe drinking water
and proper sanitation.

of the World Health Assembly (May 2000) which discussed important
issues such as the launching of an Inter-governmental Negotiating
Body to negotiate a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control;
the roll back Malaria Programme; Revised Drug Strategy; HIV/AIDS
and Food Safety. Expressing concern on the increase in communicable
diseases, the Indian delegation asked for a reasonable commitment of
resources and improvement in delivery systems for facilitating a more
focussed implementation of health programmes. During the
Ministerial Round Table on the theme Addressing the Major Health
System Challenges, the Indian delegation stated that a single model
could not be applied to all countries and a judicious mix of private
and government initiatives was required. The first session of the
Intergovernmental Negotiating Body on WHO Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control was held in Geneva in October
2000. India was elected as one of the Vice Chairs of the Negotiating
Body.

Development, Statistical Commission, Commission on Crime
Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Executive Board of World
Food Programme during the same election. India was elected
Chairman of the International Sugar Organisation Council at the
18th Session of the Council held in London on 23-24 November,
2000.
At a meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the
Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Indian
candidate, Shri R.V. Pillai was elected to the Committee on the
Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. At the General
Assembly, Shri C.R. Gharekhan was elected to the Committee on
Contributions.

Commonwealth
India, the largest member of the Commonwealth, is represented
in all its important controlling bodies of the Secretariat and
Organisations. It is the fourth largest contributor, a major source of
expert assistance provided to other Commonwealth countries and a
major destination for Commonwealth trainees. India has always
demonstrated solidarity with fellow developing nations and their
aspirations at the UN. Giving concrete meaning to this solidarity,
India augmented its contribution to the Joint Office of
101

United Nations and International Organisations

Commonwealth Small States to the UN from US $ 15,000 to US $
75,000 per annum. The gesture was appreciated by the beneficiaries.

International Law and Developments
In an important development this year, the Legal and Treaties
Division of the Ministry conducted a case concerning Aerial Incident
of August 10, 1999 against Pakistan in the International Court of
Justice and won on preliminary objection to its jurisdiction. Pakistan
filed a complaint before the ICJ on September 21, 1999 seeking
compensation from India for downing of their naval aircraft on
August 10, 1999. India submitted preliminary objections on
November 2, 1999 to the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance
with the Declaration of India of September 15, 1974 filed under Article
36(2) of the Statute of the Court indicating that disputes between
India and Pakistan, which is or has been a Member of the
Commonwealth of Nations and disputes covered by multilateral
treaties like the UN Charter are excluded.
The International Court of Justice held oral hearings from April
3  6, 2000 at The Hague following submission of Memorial by
Pakistan and a Counter-Memorial by India on the Preliminary
Objections raised by India. The judgment of the Court on jurisdiction
was delivered on June 21, 2000, wherein the Court rejected Pakistani
Application, by fourteen votes to two and found that it has no
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the claim of Pakistan against India.
The Court upheld the validity of the Commonwealth reservation
invoked by India against Pakistan.
In this connection, the Attorney General of India led a team of
experts and advocates from India. JS (L&T) acted as co-agent and
counsel/advocate in this case.
In connection with the General Assembly session for the year
2000, the Sixth Committee considered several agenda items including
the Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their
Property; United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching,
study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law;
102

Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) on the work of its thirty-third session;
Establishment of International Criminal Court; Report of the Special
Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the
Strengthening of the Role of Organisation; Measures to Eliminate
International Terrorism and Review of the Statute of the United
Nations Administrative Tribunal.
A comprehensive convention on Terrorism proposed by India
was the highlight of this session. A Working Group of the Sixth
Committee considered this draft (Document A/C.6/55/1). According
to the draft, an offence is committed if a person lawfully and
intentionally carries out an act intended to cause death or serious
bodily injury to any person, or serious damage to a State or
government facility, a public transportation system, or infrastructure
facility with the purpose of compelling a government or an
international organization to do or abstain from carrying out any
act. An accomplice of that person also commits an offence, as also
any person who organizes, directs or instigates others to do so,
according to the draft convention. The Convention would require
States to make such acts punishable as serious offences under their
laws and to either extradite or prosecute the accused persons. The
draft Convention also makes provision for mutual legal assistance in
investigation and prosecution. States would also be required to ensure
that their territories are not used for terrorist installations and training
camps, and to take necessary measures to prevent and suppress in
their territory, the preparation and financing of any acts of terrorism.
France, on behalf of EU and other like-minded States (Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Norway, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Turkey)
supported the Indian initiative, in general terms. Malaysia on behalf
of the OIC also expressed support for the draft Comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism, although it submitted its
own proposals on the definition of terrorism. Progress made so far is
good but several proposals on specific articles remain for consideration
in the meeting of the Working Group in February and October 2001

Annual Report 2000-2001

along with the pending issues concerning draft Convention on
Suppression of nuclear terrorism.
The UN Preparatory Commission on the establishment of the
International Criminal Court is continuing its work with a view to
facilitate the early establishment of the Court. It is presently
considering the question of the definition of the crime of aggression,
financial rules and regulations of the Court, the relationship agreement
between the Court and the United Nations, and the question of
privileges and immunities. The Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court which was adopted on 17 July 1998 with 120 votes
in favour, 20 abstaining and 7 against, did not come into force so far.
Only 14 States (Belgium, Belize, Canada, Fiji, France, Ghana, Iceland,
Italy, Norway, San Marino, Senegal, Tajikistan, Trinidad and Tobago
and Venezuela) have ratified the Statute. Entry into force of the Rome
Statute requires 60 ratifications.
The work of the International Law Commission (ILC) at its fiftysecond session was centered on finalisation of the second and final
reading of the topic of State Responsibility and the sub-topic of
Prevention under State Liability subject. Dr.P.S.Rao the Legal Adviser
of MEA is the Special Rapporteur for the topic on Prevention. Other
topics also making progress are: Reservations to Multilateral Treaties;
Nationality in Relation to the Succession of States and Unilateral
Acts of States. Indian delegation made statements on all these topics
in connection with the consideration of the ILC Report by the Sixth
Committee.
The Indian delegation made statements on the relevant items in
the Sixth Committee in respect of the subjects of international
terrorism, Charter Committee, International Law Commission,
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, and on
review of the Statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal.
Our delegation also made statements in the General Assembly on
the items relating to the Law of the Sea, cooperation between the
United Nations and the Asian African Legal Consultative Committee
(AALCC) and on the Report of the International Court of Justice.

UNCITRAL also made significant progress on the draft texts
regarding receivables financing and electronic signatures and is
expected to finalize its work on the draft Convention on the
Assignment of Receivables in International Trade in 2001. The
Commission also discussed issues relating to the preparation of
legislative guide on privately financed infrastructure project. After
consideration of consolidated list of legislative recommendation, it
was decided that the question of desirability and feasibility of
preparing a model law or model legislative provisions covered by
legislative guide should be considered by the Commission at its thirtyfourth session in 2001.
Several amendments to the Statute of the United Nations
Administrative Tribunal have been adopted to the following effect:
a requirement that the Tribunals members have the requisite
qualifications and experience, including legal qualifications and
experience as appropriate; to increase the term of office of the
members of the Tribunal from three years to four years with the
possibility to be re-appointed once; to make provision in the Statute
for cases raising a significant question of law to be referred for
consideration by the whole Tribunal comprised of seven members,
instead of a panel of three members. The amendments will come
into effect from 1 January 2001.
The Ministry participated in the law making activities of the UN
in various fora: the 39th Session of the UN Sub-committee (Legal) on
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space held in Vienna, Austria, from 27 - 31,
March 2000; and participated in the 3 rd Meeting of Governmental
Experts to discuss the draft Convention for the Protection of Under
Water Cultural Heritage held in Paris, France, from 2 - 7 July 2000;
and also in the international negotiation on Draft Protocol Against
the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Air and Sea, Supplementing the
UN Convention Against Trans-national Organised Crime, held in
Vienna, Austria, from 9 - 13 October 2000, and the Commission on
International Trade Law and its working groups.
The Annual conference of the Asian African Legal Consultative
103

United Nations and International Organisations

Committee (AALCC) for the year 2000 was held at Cairo from 1923 February 2000. It elected Ambassador Dr. Wafik Z. Kamil of Egypt

Foreign Economic Relations
Economic Division

T

he world economy, which had recorded a robust growth in
the year 1999, continued to register a steady growth in the
first half of the year 2000. The growth rate of world production
in 2000 exceeded 4%, while world trade grew at a rate of 12.5%, the
highest growth recorded since 1965. Among the factors that
contributed to the improvement in the global economic and financial
conditions were the economic recovery of the East Asian region, the
steady growth of knowledge-based industries and an improvement
in the trends of world trade. Towards the end of the year, however it
was seen that there was some decline in the growth registered by the
major economies.
While immediate prospects for the world economy improved,
the consolidation of global growth and ensuring a more equitable
and balanced distribution of the benefits of globalisation remain
challenges. Sustained global growth is imperative for development
and poverty reduction.
The underlying causes leading to the recessionary trends noticed
in some areas of the world in 1998 and 1999 were not mitigated. The
risks for developing countries were heightened by the emergence of
new fault lines. Oil importing countries were particularly affected
by the continued rise of oil prices. The rise in the, price of oil was
also a reminder of the uncertainties surrounding world economic
performance and the volatility of global markets.

The enormous potential and promise of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), across the world also could
not obscure the aspect of uncertainties linked to globalisation and its
impact especially on the markets of developing countries which
remained vulnerable to external shocks. The growing interdependence
of the global financial and trading system underscored the need for
increased international cooperation and dialogue to bridge the
technological and economic divide between developed and developing
nations.
Macroeconomic imbalances among the three major world
economies were evident, this being seen in the intervention by
European monetary authorities in the value of the Euro. The sharp
plunge in technology stocks also reflected persisting apprehensions
about stock market fluctuations. The impact of falling commodity
prices coupled with the growing oil imports bill of developing
countries was further compounded by diminishing ODA flows and
the shrinking of long-term capital flows to the least developed
countries. Crucial investment needs in economic and social
infrastructure were adversely affected by these trends.
Asymmetries in the multilateral trading system especially in terms
of market access for the developing countries in the developed
economy markets were further weakening factors. The post Seattle
scenario especially revealed the need for restoring confidence in the
105

Foreign Economic Relations

W.T.O. process. It was also evident that attempts to employ labour
and environmental standards in trade discussions were really disguised
forms of creeping protectionism. The number of anti-dumping
actions by the developed countries against the developing countries
has been on the increase. Agricultural production in the developed
countries also remains heavily protected and subsidized, thus shutting
out a majority of the poor, who live in the rural areas of developing
countries, from the fruits of international trade. Special and differential
treatment for developing countries guaranteed under WTO provisions
must be translated into operational reality. Developed countries
should not seek to restrict market access to goods and services and
free movement of natural persons, especially at a time when
developing countries are being asked to open up their economies
and compete in the international economic domain. Macrofundamentals in the Indian economy continued to be strong. Inflation
was modest, despite the increase in oil prices. Indias external reserves
reached an all-time high. Exports exceeded targets and the current
account deficit was within manageable limits while the fiscal deficit
was lower than in the preceding two years. Sectoral reforms continued
in many areas. The economy registered a GDP growth rate of 6.4%
in the first seven months of the fiscal year. Containing of the fiscal
deficit levels, sustaining the growth momentum in exports and
acceleration of the economic reform process are all expected to help
improve economic growth. The General Index of Industrial
Production in fact rose by 5.7% in the first seven months of the fiscal
year, while Direct Tax collection also registered an impressive increase
of 57.08 % in November over the preceding years figures, Indian
exports grew by 20.51% in the first seven months of the fiscal year at
$25.01 billion, as against $20.76 billion in the previous year. Indias
trade deficit was estimated at $5.26 billion, which was lower than the
$5.80 billion in the same period of the last year. Oil imports during
April-October were estimated at $9.73 billion, which was 85% higher
than the figure of $5.27 billion during April-October 1999.
Indias trade and economic relations with other countries
continued to register a steady growth during the year. The Ministry
106

of External Affairs, and the Indian Missions abroad interacted with
and assisted the business and industrial houses in promoting foreign
trade and Indian investment abroad. The European Union continued
to be Indias principal trading partner. The other major trading
partners were the USA, Japan, China, UAE and Russia. Major
commodities of Indias exports included agricultural and allied
products, marine products, iron ore, leather goods, gems & jewellery,
drugs & pharmaceuticals, chemicals and related products, engineering
goods, electronic goods and textiles.
A happy development for Indian food grain exporters was the
withdrawal in September 2000 by Rice Tec Inc., a Texas based US
company, of some of its claims in the US patent which it had obtained
to market a new variety of rice grown in the U.S.A as basmati rice.
The Government of India had contested the patent in the US Patent
and Trade marks office, and Rice Tecs withdrawal of four of its
claims to uniqueness in support of naming the new variety of rice as
basmati rice has reduced the possibility of Rice Tecs patent being
used to interfere in the export of Indian basmati rice.
The single largest item in Indias export basket is diamond and
India is the largest exporter of cut and polished diamonds in the world.
Diamond exports from India have multiplied 1200 times in a span of
thirty years, reaching $ 6.2 billion in 1999. India processes nearly
70% of the rough diamonds mined in the world and contributes to
50% of the world diamond market in value terms.
India has made great strides in the pharmaceutical industry and
is now one of the leading exporters of pharmaceuticals. Indian
medicines and formulations have penetrated markets in all the
developed and developing countries of the world. The growth in the
export of Indian pharmaceuticals in the recent years has been quite
impressive. During the last three financial years the annual exports
exceeded Rs. 5000 crores and there is a great potential for further
growth. Nevertheless, Indian pharmaceutical exporters encounter
certain problems in many countries, such as difficulties in registration
of Indian drugs and non-tariff barriers. In August 2000 a meeting

Annual Report 2000-2001

chaired by the Secretary (Economic Relations) was held in the
Ministry to discuss such problems and remedial measures. The
meeting was attended by representatives of the Ministries of Health,
Commerce & Industry and Chemicals & Fertilizers and business
organisations. Suggestions and observations of the participants of the
meeting were circulated to Indian Missions abroad for follow-up
action.
India continued to face trade defence instruments like antidumping duties and countervailing duties, particularly in the EU
countries, in its exports in such sectors as textiles, pharmaceuticals
and iron and steel, where Indian exports are competitive. India remains
one of the most targeted countries for anti-dumping action by the
European Union. Lately there have been problems in Indias steel
exports to the United States of America as well. Under pressure of
the US steel manufacturing companies the U.S Government initiated
in November 2000, anti-dumping and countervailing duty
investigations against certain steel products from India. Efforts to
avert imposition of duties are being made by the Indian side. India
has been encountering difficulties in its textile exports to EU countries
because of the European Unions refusal to release exceptional
flexibilities (using the quota of one category in some other category)
since 1997. Following the Government of Indias sustained efforts in
this regard the European Union decided in September 2000 to release
3500 tonnes of exceptional flexibilities making it possible for Indian
textile exports to EU countries to go up by Rs. 300 crores.
Export promotion activities included the holding of a number of
trade fairs, exhibitions and seminars both at home and abroad. The
India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) organised the annual
India International Trade Fair in New Delhi in November 2000,
(IITF-2000). The exhibition was a showcase of India in diverse fields
such as industry, infrastructure, technology, telecommunications,
services, human resources, agriculture and agrotechnology, consumer
durables, food and food products, health care, textiles, giftware and
kitchenware. Over 5000 companies including 300 from abroad

participated in the event. An Asia Pacific Millenium Fair (ASPAT
2000) was also concurrently held with the IITF - 2000. It was jointly
organised by the United Nations, ESCAP, Ministry of Commerce
and Industry and ITPO. Among the other trade fairs organised by
the ITPO were an international leather fair in Chennai in January/
February 2000 and in Calcutta in March 2000, a Food Expo in New
Delhi in March 2000 and a textiles fair in New Delhi in October
2000. The other trade promotional events in India included the World
Book Fair 2000 in New Delhi organised by the National Book Trust
of India in Feb 2000, Plastindia 2000 in New Delhi by the Plastindia
Foundation in Feb 2000, Jute India by Jute Manufactures
Development Council in Calcutta in Feb 2000, Metals & Metallurgy
2000 by Telcon Projects India Pvt. Ltd. in New Delhi in Sep 2000,
Asia Pacific Expo 2000 by the Federation of Indian Chamber of
Commerce & Industry in New Delhi in September 2000, Delhi
International Jewellery & Watch Exhibition by ITE India Pvt. Ltd
in New Delhi in Oct. 2000 and an Indian Railway Equipment
Exhibition by the Confederation of Indian Industry in New Delhi
in Oct. 2000.
Indian companies and enterprises participated in several trade
promotional events abroad such as the EXPOCOMER-2000 in
Panama in March 2000, the Harrods Indian Food Millennium
Promotion-2000 in London in August 2000, the Bucharest
International Consumer Goods Fair TIBCO-2000 in Bucharest, the
Vietnam International Trade Fair in Hanoi in Oct. 2000 and the
Expo-2000 World Exhibition held in Hanover, Germany from JuneOctober 2000. The Indian Missions abroad made all possible efforts
to ensure wide participation of foreign enterprises in trade
promotional events in India, and Indian enterprises in events abroad.
The Missions themselves organised a number of trade fairs/exhibitions
with a view to promoting Indias exports.
The landmark visits of the President of the United States of
America to India in March 2000 and the Prime Minister to USA in
September 2000 greatly helped in strengthening and expanding the
107

Foreign Economic Relations

economic and commercial relations between India and the U.S.A.
The year under report also witnessed a number of exchanges of
economic and trade delegations, both official and non-official, between
India and other countries. Among the notable official trade delegations
to India was the delegation from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) of the Government of Japan that visited New
Delhi in March 2000 to participate in the fourth round of MEAMITI Dialogue. This round of talks highlighted the importance and
mutual advantages of increased India - Japan cooperation in the field
of information technology, Indias growing strength in which has
been widely recognised.
In a significant development in Indias commercial relations with
other countries, the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement which
had been signed on 28 December 1998 came into force from 1 March
2000. The Agreement is expected to help consolidate and expand the
economic and commercial relations between India and Sri Lanka
through increased bilateral trade and investment.
The Ministry continued its policy of supporting and promoting
Indian investment abroad. The Government of India has been
progressively simplifying the procedures for granting approval to
proposals of overseas investment. Notable among the investment
destinations were the U.S.A, U.K., U.A.E, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Sri Lanka and Mauritius in such areas as engineering and
construction, software, telecommunciations, chemicals &
pharmaceuticals, iron & steel and consultancy. The Ministry worked
with other governmental bodies, business houses and Indian Missions
abroad to explore the possibilities of widening and expanding Indias
overseas investment.
The Ministry actively supported the proposals of ONGC Videsh
Ltd. (OVL) for petroleum exploration activities in other countries.
The OVL has been expanding its activities in recent years. It already
has a presence in Vietnam and is considering collaborations in some
other countries for exploration activities.
An important development in Indias cooperation with other
108

countries in the area of energy was the setting up of a dialogue forum
with the Government of Japan to exchange views on India-Japan
energy cooperation. The first round of India-Japan Energy talks was
held in New Delhi in March 2000. The Indian side was represented
by the Ministries of Power, Petroleum & Natural Gas, Mines &
Minerals, Non-Conventional Energy Sources, Environment &
Forests & External Affairs and The Planning Commission and the
Japanese side by the Ministry of International Trade & Industry,
Govt. of Japan, and the Embassy of Japan, New Delhi. The Talks
focussed on exchanging information and promoting mutual
understanding of each others energy policy and the direction of future
cooperation.
Indias efforts to develop energy from non-conventional sources
have showed positive results and foreign collaborations in this area
have also been developing. Recently, the Ministry of Non
Conventional Energy Sources introduced a scheme to demonstrate
in neighbouring and other developing countries, the wind energy
turbines produced in India, with a view to promoting their exports.
The Ministry of External Affairs circulated the scheme to certain
countries, several of which have responded positively to the offer.
Exchanges of trainees between India and other developing
countries under the Colombo Plan and Technical Cooperation
Programmes continued. Under these programmes, Government of
India nominees participated in training programmes in countries like
Thailand and Indonesia in such areas as health & medicine,
engineering, telecommunication, finance management, irrigation,
fisheries, housing and export promotion.
The Ministry continued to interact closely with various
governmental and other bodies in the matter of promoting exports
and overseas investments. It is represented in the governing bodies
of OCCI, ITPO, IRCON Ltd., WAPCOS and ONGC Videsh Ltd.
It encouraged and supported efforts of non-governmental
organisations to promote Indias economic and commercial relations
with other countries. The Ministry extended its support to the Asia-

Annual Report 2000-2001

Pacific Region Micro-Credit Summit in New Delhi being organised
in February 2001 by the All India Womens Conference (AIWC),
New Delhi, which is a national level NGO for the social and economic
uplift of women and children.
Some of the countries that had imposed certain restrictive
economic measures against India following Indias nuclear tests in
May 1998 have progressively removed them. The Government of
India has always maintained that unilateral restrictive measures against
India are unjustified and counter productive and that they impede
the free flow of trade, technology and capital and have an adverse
impact on mutually beneficial economic interaction.
The United States of America has lifted several of the restrictive
measures. As of now 52 entities stand removed from the list of over
200 Indian entities identified in 1998 for US export control. Sweden,
Germany, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands have resumed
development cooperation with India.

Multilateral Economic Relations
India continued to play an active role in various international
organisations and multilateral and regional groupings. At various
multilateral fora, including the WTO, India continued to flag
attention to important economic issues, especially in the context of
developing countries. The need for sustained interaction between
developed and developing countries on matters concerning trade,
investment, technology flows and aid was stressed. India emphasised
that the developing countries should evolve common strategies to
protect their fundamental and common economic concerns.
The year under review saw an intense multilateral dialogue that
helped to highlight the problems of development, and the resolve of
the developing countries to bring their economic concerns to the
forefront of the global governance agenda. It was recognised that
technology and trade competitiveness would be key determinants of
economic development, and that the economics of the future would
be strong in knowledge-based industries and entrepreneurship. Full

participation of the developing countries in the global information
society is an immediate necessity if the populations of developing
countries are to benefit from globalisation. India therefore stressed
that all aspects of technology flows from North to the South would
be fundamental to the dialogue between the developed and developing
countries. Furthermore, a common understanding would have to be
achieved between the North and the South of the elements of
sustainable social and economic development, as well as participatory
ways to achieve these objectives. A global convergence on
development would have to be reached.
At the South Summit held in Havana, Cuba, in April 2000, for
the first time, developing countries met at the Summit level, to seek
solutions to the array of urgent development problems, and for
initiating a dynamic coordination process among the G77. The
Summit discussed four broad themes: globalisation of the world
economy, North-South relations, South-South cooperation, and
knowledge and technology. Under each of these themes, the validity
of the joint G77 endeavour was reaffirmed and there was clarity in
spelling out objectives. India played an active and leading role in the
discussions in Havana and helped the Summit to highlight the main
concerns of the developing countries, and to identify action needed
to be taken within the South-South and the North-South context to
bring development issues in focus in all multilateral institutions and
policy-making processes.
It was seen that there is little consensus between the North and
the South about how globalisation affects people or how it should be
steered. India recognised that potentially, the energy inherent in
globalisation could lead to prosperity for the developing countries if
international trade, financial and economic arrangements were also
designed to promote human welfare , and preserve cultural diversity,
instead of just helping the affluent to accumulate greater wealth. The
crucial factor in poverty reduction would be the international enabling
environment - the extent to which market access is provided to
developing country exports, the scope of debt reduction and increased
109

Foreign Economic Relations

development assistance, the access to technology, and the structure
of the world trading regime and international financial institutions.
While it was acknowledged that a vibrant market economy can
be the engine of long-term sustainable development, market forces
must be guided to maximise welfare and avoid social distress.
Economic growth must go with the needs of development, respect
for the environment, and investment in education and health for all.
India expressed itself in favour of moves that would channel as much
as possible of the gains of globalisation into time-bound poverty
eradication initiatives. Poverty eradication was defined as the central
challenge for the 21st century. Human development would be
essential for realising human rights, and such human development
would have to be realised universally through stronger international
action. The right of development and the right to poverty eradication
could not be lost sight of, and trade, investment, technology and aid
would have to serve the primacy of these rights.
As a founder member of the Group of Fifteen (G-15) since its
formation at the time of the NAM Summit in Belgrade in 1989, India
continued to play an active role in the deliberations, projects and
activities of G-15.
The Tenth G-15 Summit was held in Cairo from 13-20 June 2000.
Shri Krishan Kant, Honble Vice President, led the high-level Indian
delegation, which included the Honble Minister of Commerce and
Industry, Shri Murasoli Maran. The Summit meetings focussed on a
variety of issues and themes of critical importance to countries of the
South: global developments in the 21st century and prospects of the
South; impact of globalisation; alleviation of poverty and external
debt; strengthening of the multilateral trading system to make it more
equitable; North-South Dialogue; revamping of the international
financial architecture; transfer of technology; South-South
Cooperation; and Peace, Disarmament and Development. The
Summit recommended early action on issues of importance to
countries of the South as proposed under the UNCTAD-X
Declaration and Plan of Action (February 2000, Bangkok) and the
110

G-77 South Summit Declaration and Plan of Action (April 2000,
Havana). At die meetings, the Vice President and Commerce Minister
articulated Indias concerns on major issues - e.g., principled negation
of any endorsement of a new WTO round, ensuring attention to the
special and differential needs of developing countries under the WTO,
renewed focus on tangible and effective G-15 projects, revamping of
the international financial architecture, etc. These were endorsed by
several member countries and incorporated in the Joint Communique
issued at the conclusion of the Summit.
The G-15 Foreign Ministers met in Mexico City from 30-31
October 2000 to review the implementation of the decisions taken at
the Xth G-15 Summit, and to prepare for the XIth Summit to be
held in Jakarta, Indonesia in May 2001. The high-level Indian
delegation was led by Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Honble Minister of
State for External Affairs. The Meeting considered a wide range of
issues including poverty alleviation, trade and investment,
environmental issues, information and communications technologies,
incentives for small and medium enterprises, reform of the
international financial architecture and human resources
development. The Indian delegation played an active role in shaping
discussions on crucial issues on the agenda, particularly poverty
alleviation and cooperation in human resources development, for
which Shri Ajit Kumar Panja, Honble Minister of State for External
Affairs, was the lead Speaker. The Meeting adopted a consensus
Statement on key issues on the agenda. Indias concerns on trade,
external debt, poverty alleviation, environmental issues, human
resource cooperation, etc., were fully reflected in the Statement, issued
at the end of the Meeting.
A meeting of G-l 5 Solar Energy Technology Experts was held
in New Delhi in December 2000.
Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee wrote to the Egyptian
President, Egypt being the Chairman of G-15, that joint action by
G-8 and G-15 emanates from a community of interests between
the developing and developed countries, and would contribute

significantly to the international consultative process on the priority
issues of the global economic agenda.
India continues to be in favour of regular consultations between
the developed and developing countries. Minister of Commerce and
Industry, Shri Murasoli Maran, said in his address at the G-15 Foreign
Ministers Meeting, at the Xth G-15 Summit in Cairo in June 2000,
that an intensive dialogue between G-15 and G-8 is advisable before
we negotiate with international bodies. In order to upgrade the level
and content of such dialogue, it would be useful to have meetings
between the Trade as well as the Foreign Ministers of G-15 and G-8.
This suggestion received wide support from the G-15 member
countries.
India welcomes the decision of the G-8 Okinawa Summit held in
July 2000 to reach out to developing countries to help them face the
challenges posed by globalisation. The benefits of globalisation and
information technology have bypassed large sections of society in
developing countries. The resolve expressed at the Okinawa Summit
to make efforts to bridge the Digital Divide was therefore
encouraging. Joint initiatives in a true spirit of partnership would
require to be undertaken by the developed and developing countries
to face these challenges and address the multitude of problems before
us: poverty alleviation, debt reduction, public health, and to thereby
ensure sustainable development. Given the importance of trade in
promoting growth and reducing poverty in developing countries,
the recognition by the Okinawa Summit of the need to strengthen
the multilateral trading system to address the legitimate concerns of
developing countries was a positive sign.
Indias relations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) have intensified considerably over the
previous years. The OECD has been involving emerging economies,
such as India, in a dialogue on important economic and trade issues.
India participates in the OECD Special Dialogue with non-member
countries and in several OECD events pertaining to small & medium
enterprises, taxation, global biodiversity, agriculture, etc.

India takes active part in all G-77 initiatives and endeavours aimed
at promoting greater South-South Economic Cooperation as
contained in the Caracas Plan of Action (1981) and the San Jose Plan
of Action (1997). India believes that recent developments pertaining
to globalisation of the world economy and the ongoing financial
crisis in many developing countries only strengthen the rationale for
intensifying G-77 economic cooperation activities. India supports G77 measures addressing issues of common concern to developing
countries whether in the context of globalisation of the world
economy, reforms in the international financial architecture, or with
regard to interacting closely for monitoring the interests of developing
countries in international organisations like the WTO and
international financial institutions which impact on the international
climate for trade and investment.
Dr. Murali Manohar Joshi, Honble Union Minister for Human
Resource Development and Science & Technology, led the Indian
delegation to the Group of 77 (G-77) South Summit held in Havana
from 11-14 April 2000. The Summit deliberated on four broad themes:
Globalisation; Knowledge and Technology; South-South
Cooperation; and North-South relations, The Summit stressed the
need for further strengthening the rule-based multilateral trading
system to make it more fair and equitable, taking into account the
needs of developing countries, and called upon industrialised nations
to fully address the implementation issues of the Uruguay Round
Agreements of concern to developing countries. Inter alia, it called
for improved market access for goods and services of developing
countries to the industrialised nations, and opposed all protectionist
measures under the guise of labour standards and environment. While
the Summit stressed the importance of the developing countries
obtaining preferential access to technology and resources of the
industrialised countries, it also stressed that developing countries
should cooperatively harness the potential of their own knowledge
and technology, as well as human resources. The Summit further
underlined the importance of the developing countries forging
common positions in international fora on issues of concern to them.
111

Foreign Economic Relations

It was agreed that the North-South dialogue should be revitalised in
order to ensure that development issues become central to this
dialogue. In this context, the Summit deliberations referred to the
importance of enhancement of Official Development Assistance
(ODA) to developing countries, rescheduling of debt, the need for a
new international financial architecture, and of a multilateral trade
regime that takes development requirements into account.
India played an active and leading role in the discussions in
Havana. It was also instrumental in helping the Summit to highlight
the main concerns of the developing countries, and to identify action
needed to be taken within the South-South and North-South context
to bring development issues in focus in all multilateral institutions
and policy making processes. Participating delegations endorsed this
approach to South-South Cooperation. The documents finalised at
the Summit, i.e. Havana Programme of Action and the Havana
Declaration, reflect these priorities.
The 24th G-77 Annual Ministerial Meeting was held in New
York on 15th September 2000 at the time of the United Nations
General Assembly Meeting. EAM led the Indian delegation. The
meeting reaffirmed the decisions of the South Summit held in Havana
in April 2000 and committed the G-77 to the speedy and effective
implementation of the Havana Programme of Action and other
decisions of the South Summit. At the meeting, India stressed the
need for unity and determination on part of G-77 to implement the
decisions of the South Summit, and the need to ensure that the global
agenda did not ignore the right to development and the right to
poverty eradication. In this context, India raised economic, social
and trade issues in the light of the Okinawa G-8 Summit, the UN
Special Session in Geneva in June 2000, and the ongoing WTO debate.
ECDC (Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries)
& TCDC (Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries)
were actively pursued as a cost-effective modality for South-South
Technical Cooperation and as a means of realising collective selfreliance.
112

India continued to emphasise the need that the South Centre
(Geneva based academic body consisting of 46 members from G-77 /
NAM) should re-examine its work methods with a view to optimise
use of existing resources.
India is an active participant in IOR-ARC (Indian Ocean Rim
Association for Regional Cooperation). It is participating in four
projects under the IOR-ARC including IOR-ARC Business Centre,
IOR-ARC Chair, Trade Promotion Programme and Investment
Facilitation and Promotion. India is also participating actively in
projects being coordinated by other member countries.
The meetings of IOR-AG (Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group)
and IOR-BF (Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum) were held in July
2000 in Maputo. Representatives from India and other IOR countries
participated in the meetings. The meetings reviewed the progress of
IOR projects and had fruitful discussions that provided useful inputs
in the consideration, formulation and implementation of the projects
in the Work Programmes of IOR-ARC.
The Ministry of External Affairs actively pursued the ongoing
inter-ministerial consultation on the finalisation of Governments
proposals on the mandated negotiations relating to the WTO
Agreement on Agriculture (AOA). It worked closely with the
Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure
that Indias proposals reflects national-level concerns to protect the
interests of our farmers, and to vigorously safeguard our food security.
At various multilateral meetings, India stressed that the iniquities,
imbalances and anomalies in existing WTO agreements should be
removed and that these imbalances had come to light more
dramatically during their implementation in the last five years.
Onerous obligations had been imposed on the developing countries
and market access for their products still remained a mirage. New
methods had been found for keeping out the goods of developing
countries from developed markets, replacing tariff barriers with nontariff barriers like health and safety standards. It was therefore
imperative that the issues of implementation of Uruguay Round

Annual Report 2000-2001

Agreements are addressed upfront and key imbalances removed.
Pressures to observe strict core labour standards and widening of the
environment window to restrict and deny market access of the
products of developing countries also do not bode well for the
multilateral trading system. Moves to strengthen coherence between
WTO and Bretton Woods institutions were a similar cause for
concern. India emphasised that groupings like the G-15 have a major
responsibility in pressing the concern of developing countries to the
top of the WTO agenda.
Indias dialogue partnership with ASEAN was further
consolidated by the robust structure of India-ASEAN interaction in
various fields such as trade & investment, science & technology,
tourism, human resource development, and transport &
infrastructure. Such linkages are expected to intensify in the coming
years.
India, in its capacity as a Full Dialogue Partner of ASEAN,
participated in the 33rd ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences (PMC)
in Bangkok on 28 & 29 July 2000. The Indian delegation was led by
the External Affairs Minister. In his interventions at the PMC
meetings, EAM emphasised the need for early action in regulating
money flows, whose volumes are several times that of trade in goods
and services. Commenting on the Digital Divide, EAM said that
the approach of governments should be to use information technology
(IT) as a tool for economic development, and the Internet for public
good. EAM conveyed Indias commitment to participate in
infrastructure and other development projects in the Mekong River
Basin. EAM also stressed the importance of actual delivery on proposal
and agreed projects. In addition, EAM had productive bilateral
meetings with a number of his counterparts.
As part of ASEAN-India cooperation in the field of advanced
materials, a Joint ASEAN-India Workshop on high-energy rare earth
magnets was held in Kuala Lumpur on 23-25 August 2000,
representing the successful culmination of the ASEAN-India
cooperative project on such magnets. In addition to scientists from

India and ASEAN, a number of entrepreneurs and industrialists from
India and ASEAN attended the workshop. Besides promoting closer
contacts between the scientists of India and ASEAN, the project has
resulted in a better understanding of the technology involved in the
fabrication and applications of such composite material magnets and
is expected to lead to commercial spin-offs for the Indian magnet
industry.
A Joint ASEAN-India Workshop on Human Resource
Development was held in New Delhi on 16 & 17 October 2000. The
objective of the Workshop was to find practical ways and means for
implementing those recommendations of the Joint Study on Indian
and ASEAN capabilities and complementarities in the HRD sector
which had been accepted by the ASEAN-India Joint Cooperation
Committee at its meeting in March 2000. A number of thrust areas
were identified at the Workshop, such as accreditation and quality
management, IT and management.
The Honble Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, H.E. Dato
Seri Syed Hamid Albar, delivered a lecture in New Delhi on 9th
October 2000 on India-ASEAN Partnership: Challenges and
Opportunities under the ASEAN-India Eminent Persons Lecture
Series Programme, which has been launched with the objective of
promoting awareness about the reality and potential of the IndiaASEAN partnership.
ASEANs Sub-Committee on Space Technology and Application
(SCOSA) has favourably considered the prospect of ASEAN-India
collaboration on space technology in two areas:

113

Foreign Economic Relations

were nominated for a six week training programme by the following
ASEAN countries: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao
PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam. Wholly financed by the Government of India, the training
programme was conducted on behalf of the MEA by NUT, a reputed
private sector company in the field of IT training.
EAM led the Indian delegation to the First Ministerial Meeting
of the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) initiative held in Vientiane
(Lao PDR) from 9-13 November 2000. The MGC is an initiative by
India and five ASEAN countries - Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam,
Lao PDR and Myanmar for cooperation in tourism, culture,
education, as well as transport and communication. The ministers
also formally launched the MGC, which had been announced earlier
in a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of India, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Thailand, Myanmar and Lao PDR at the time of the ASEAN PMC
in July 2000. The meeting adopted the Vientiane Declaration, which
covers cooperation in the above areas. The MGC will meet annually
at the ministerial level in order to review the implementation of the
agreed projects.
Cooperation in tourism envisaged by the Vientiane Declaration
includes strategic studies for joint marketing, establishment of
networks among tourism training institutions, and expansion of multimodal communication and transportation linkages among MGC
countries to encourage travel and tourism, besides promotion of
package tours to famous cultural, religious and eco-tourism sites in
MGC countries. Under culture, the Declaration covers promotion
of joint research in the dance, music and theatrical forms of the MGC
countries, organisation of round tables for journalists, writers and
literary experts, performing arts, etc., as well as the conservation of
heritage sites, monuments and old manuscripts in MGC countries.
Besides, the Declaration commits the MGC countries to make
common efforts for expanding the export market for their handicrafts
and traditional textiles. In education, the cooperative activities under
the Declaration include promotion of exchange of students and faculty
114

between recognised technology and management institutions, and
MGC scholarships for outstanding students in specific subjects, as
well as establishment of networking and twinning arrangements
among MGC universities, particularly in social sciences, humanities,
engineering and area studies. In the area of transport &
communication, the cooperative activities mentioned in the
Declaration include making efforts to develop transport networks in
the region, in particular the East-West Corridor project and the TransAsian Highway, promotion in cooperation in air services and linkages
in the region, and cooperation in the development of IT
infrastructures and networks.
India considers BIMST-EC, a sub-regional economic grouping
of the countries along the Bay of Bengal, as an important initiative
for regional cooperation. Formed in 1997, BIMST-EC is an important
component of Indias Look East policy. BIMST-EC is also a forum
where member countries can work together to revive the traditional
civilisational linkages which have been neglected during the colonial
phase of history. India participates actively in BIMST-EC to give the
grouping substantive content and make it beneficial for the peoples
of these countries. Thus, India continued to play an important role
in various BIMST-EC meetings in working out the modalities for
working together in the sectors identified for cooperation under
BIMST-EC, e.g., trade and investment, energy, transport and
communication, tourism, technology, etc.
The Trade Ministers of BIMST-EC countries met in New Delhi
on 27th April 2000. Recognising the importance of well-developed
transport and communication facilities for enhanced economic
cooperation in the BIMST-EC region, the Ministers called for a
cohesive and well-coordinated approach to ensure early
implementation of the agreed projects. India was chosen to function
as the lead country for the transport & communication sector. The
Meeting further recognised that Intellectual Property Rights are a
major area of concern for developing countries. Also, with electronic
commerce (e-commerce) playing an increasingly important role in

Annual Report 2000-2001

international business, the Meeting recognised the need for member
countries to keep abreast of developments in this field. It was agreed
that India would be the focal point for possible initiatives in ecommerce, including the launch of e-BIMST-EC. The Ministers
stressed the importance of a clear work programme to implement
their shared vision of a Free Trade Area in the BIMST-EC region.
The Third BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting was held in New Delhi
on 6th July 2000. At the Meeting, India took over the Chairmanship
of BIMST-EC from Bangladesh. The Ministers noted that with the
global economy on a recovery path after the financial crisis, this was
the right time to impart momentum to BIMST-EC by enhancing
economic, commercial and technical cooperation among the member
countries, both at the government and at the private sector levels. It
was felt that in addition to tangible co-operation initiatives, BIMSTEC should focus on the software aspects of such co-operation: as a
first step, member countries should expeditiously initiate efforts to
compile rules and regulations, particularly in the areas of transport
& communication and tourism; Indias offer to undertake this
compilation was welcomed. The Ministers stressed the need for
monitoring of the Action Plans under each sector and sub-sector for
early and effective implementation. In view of the importance of the
tourism sector, the Meeting urged the member countries to redouble
their efforts. India reiterated its offer to set up a BIMST-EC Internet
portal to facilitate trade and investment exchanges and promote ecommerce. In the Energy sector, it was decided to enhance cooperation in areas such as sharing of energy-related information and
data, sharing of technology and expertise, and co-operation in energydevelopment programmes. They also recognised the threat posed by
* terrorism to peace, stability and economic development.
The BIMST-EC Expert Group on Technology had its first
meeting in New Delhi on 18-19 December 2000. Experts from the
BIMST-EC countries, namely Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka
and Thailand attended the meeting. The meeting was inaugurated by
the Honble Shri Bachi Singh Rawat, Minister of State for Science
and Technology.

The meeting adopted an Agreed Statement on Cooperation in
the Technology Sector and agreed upon an Action Plan for
cooperation in this sector for the period 2001-2005. The member
countries recognised the need to enhance the technological capabilities
of the BIMST-EC region in order to develop interaction between
R&D and industry for commercial benefit through quality
production. The meeting recognised the need to facilitate the growth
of technology-intensive ventures and encourage innovation for the
development of new and appropriate technologies, as well as the
importance of making concerted efforts to overcome the Digital
Divide within the BIMST-EC region. The meeting identified a
number of priority areas for mounting regional projects and
cooperative programmes: e.g., agro-food science & technology,
including storage and preservation, soil and water management,
agricultural technology & agro-instrumentation, biotechnology,
food technology, soil & water management, medical science &
instrumentation, herbal drugs, electronics & information technology,
oceanography, disaster mitigation & management, environmentfriendly technologies, etc.

Trade and Investment Promotion

T

he Central Government and the State Governments took
several initiatives and measures during the year aimed at
encouraging foreign investment inflows, particularly the flow of
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India. Major thrust areas
included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power,
telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment
Technology Promotion Division to actively undertake effective
investment promotion and publicity efforts, particularly through the
Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment
into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missions
are the first point of contact for the foreign investor. It is, therefore,
essential that the Missions are given full back-up support in their
efforts in the form of providing up-to-date information about the
economy, the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and
opportunities available in different sectors, the incentives offered by
the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions
are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of
delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of
other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these
and related matters, the Investment Technology Promotion (ITP)
Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and
coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication
between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments
or other agencies, as the case may be.
118

Policy
The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever
required, based on investment trends world-wide and based on the
need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and
our economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the
Missions on foreign investor perceptions about Indias investment
policies or about successful models/policies followed elsewhere for
serving as inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review
of an existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national
interest.
The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and Foreign Investment
Implementation Authority (FIIA) in collaboration with the Ministries
and State Governments. In FIPB, the Ministry was represented by
Secretary (ER) and investments from NRIs were given particular
attention. In FIIA, specific policy measures to speed up the investment
were taken up with concerned Ministries and State Governments.

Promotional Efforts and Initiatives
The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably
projecting the various investment policies and announcements of the
Government by coordinating with the Missions on the one had and
various economic Ministries of the Central Government and State

Annual Report 2000-2001

Governments on the other. Weekly Economic News Bulletin
highlighting major policy decisions and new opportunities were sent
to all Missions to keep them abreast of developments. Despatch of
Weekly Economic News Bulletin by e-mail ensured fast and cost
effective transmission. Missions were also encouraged to hold
investment promotion seminars and workshops besides extending
investment support services, for which suitable publicity material,
speaking points etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were
held by several of our Missions in identified target countries. Ministry
also undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures
and opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.
The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations
including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging
suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials
and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations.
The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by
the Missions, visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having
appropriate meetings with concerned Government Departments.
The ITP Division was in the process of publishing the brochure in
French, German and Spanish languages.

Technology Aspects and Other Issues
JS (ITP) was a member of the IT Task Force of Ministry of
External Affairs which dealt with the issues related to IT
implementation in MEA such as provision of computers to all
sections, development of data bases of information in section, network
within the section, networking at Division level, application software
for networking and data bases, Internet and e-mail facilities, computers
and internet facilities at the residence of joint secretaries and above,
computerization of Missions, delivery of public services/websites,
training etc. IT Task Force also dealt with implementation of
minimum agenda for e-governance approved by High Powered
Committee, an Inter-ministerial body coordinated by the Deptt. of

Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. ITP Division further
dealt with various technology related issues with potential
international ramification such as cyber crime. ITP Division provided
inputs to other Divisions on negotiations with other countries
involving application of high-technology such as establishment of
energy transfer through international pipeline. ITP Division was the
nodal Division in the Ministry of External Affairs for promotion of
tourism and acted as an interface between Indian Missions abroad
and Department of Tourism and other agencies in India engaged in
tourism promotion. Many Indian Missions organised India Food
Festivals and other tourism promotion events. They maintained close
contact with Government of India Tourism offices abroad.

Agreements
The Ministry participated in the negotiations for drawing up of
Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs)
and Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) that were
held in respect of a number of countries. During the year, BIPPA
was signed with Portugal, Sweden and Thailand. Negotiations for
signing BIPPA with Bahrain, UAE and Lao Republic were completed.
In respect of DTAA, an agreement was signed with Ireland and
negotiations for signing were completed with Mexico. Entry into
force of DTAA with Portugal took place during the year.
The Ministry also participated in the negotiations relating to
Bilateral Civil Aviation matters with other countries. The Ministry
provided legal inputs, as required, and also tendered advice based on
the need for increased civil aviation links, particularly with
neighbouring regions, to evolve in consonance with the initiatives
being taken on the foreign policy front. Air Services Agreements
(ASA) were signed with Bahrain and Algeria. Negotiations for signing
ASA were completed with Cyprus and Madagascar. Memorandums
of Understanding were signed with Syria, Kuwait, Malaysia, Gulf
countries (UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain) and Russia.

Policy Planning and Research

T

he Policy Planning & Research Division serves as a nodal
point for interaction with the National Security Council
Secretariat (NSCS) formerly known as the Joint Intelligence
Committee (JIC), the University Grants Commission (UGC) and its
affiliates and the Area Study Centres (ASC) located in various
universities and specializing in research on various regions of the
world.
The Division extended financial, assistance to various academic
institutions/think tanks located in different parts of the country for
holding conferences, seminars, preparation of research papers,
exchange of scholars and support for Track-II programmes on issues
related to Indias external relations and security. A list of seminars/
conferences/meetings organized by institutions/NGOs partly funded
by the Policy Planning Division is given at AnnexureThe subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects
covered Indian Foreign and Security Policies in the new decade, Indias
bilateral relations with countries like Israel, Iran, Japan & Russia,
United Nations in the New Millennium, Abolition of Nuclear
Weapons, Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Human Security and
curb on small arms, Marketing Cooperation with South & East Asian
Countries, the impact of economic reforms in select developing
countries, Indian Ocean, and Global Organization of People of Indian

Origin. Support was also provided to Indian scholars experts attending
seminars, workshops and conferences, Austria, Bhutan, Kazakhstan,
Malaysia, Mongolia, and Indonesia.
To further strengthen Ministrys capabilities in research and
analyses, the Division had last year prepared a detailed proposal for
revival of the Research Cadre as recommended by the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on External Affairs. However, because of the
existing policy of right sizing the bureaucracy, scaling down of nonplan expenditure and continued ban on creation of new posts, the
proposal was not pursued further. Nevertheless, in view of the
continuing relevance of the role of the Historical Division, it was
recommended that the Division would be revived and headed by a
Director under the overall supervision of Joint Secretary (PP&R).
The Honble President of India promulgated the Indian Council
of World Affairs (ICWA) Ordinance, 2000 (No.3 of 2000) on the 1st
of September 2000. As a nodal Division of the Ministry of External
Affairs dealing with academic/research institutions, this Division was
actively associated with the course of action leading to the
promulgation of the ICWA. Ordinance 2000 (No.3 of 2000). The
newly incorporated Council, set up under the Ordinance, took
control of the ICWA premises (Sapru House) on the 2 September
2000, and immediately drew up an emergency plan for the repair/
121

Policy Planning and Research

renovation of the premises, revamping of the Library, restoration of
the Auditorium and resumption of the normal activities of the ICWA.
With the help of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD),
the outer façade of the premises, the Administrative Block and the
Library have since been repaired and repainted. The Committee
Room has been fully renovated and made functional. Work on the
Auditorium is continuing. Garden and pathways in front have been
restored, boundary walls at places have been raised and grills installed.
It is expected that the ICWA will be fully operational by the end of
March 2001.
The Indian Council of World Affairs Bill 2000, which was
introduced on 27.11.2000 in the Lok Sabha, was considered and passed
by the Lok Sabha on the 18th of December 2000. The ICWA Bill,
2000 was listed for consideration by the Rajya Sabha on the 21st of
December, 2000. However, before the Bill could be so considered,
the Rajya Sabha was adjourned. As a result, the ICWA Ordinance
2000 (No.3 of 2000) in terms of Article 123 (2) (a) of the Constitution,
lapsed on January 1, 2001, upon the expiry of six weeks from the
date(20.11.2000) of re-assembly of Parliament. In order to maintain
continuity in Government action, it was necessary to sustain the
status of the Indian Council of World Affairs as an institution of
national importance. Therefore, the ICWA Ordinance 2001 (No.1
of 2001) was promulgated on the 5 January 2001 with retrospective
effect from the 1 September 2000.
The Research Section of the Division continued to edit and
publish the Annual Report of the Ministry. The Report served as a
compendium of Indias interaction with the rest of the world in the
political, economic and cultural fields, including the views of the
government on various facets of international relations.
The Division rendered all possible assistance to territorial divisions
as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific information
or document on international relations was required. The Research
Section examined the depiction of Indias international boundaries
122

in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were taken up
with the concerned government or the publisher through Indian
Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The Division also
scrutinized foreign publications containing maps depicting Indias
external boundaries before these were imported in to the country
and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such matters. It
coordinated the supply of map-sheets to various Government and
semi-Government agencies for use in their official work with the
Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The Research Section
dealt with requests from research scholars for access to the records of
the Ministry.
The Division also deals with matters related to the National
Archives of India. JS(PP&R) attends all meetings of the Archival
Advisory Board of the National Archives of India as a member.
The Ministrys Library which functions under the overall control
of this Division has modern information technology equipment and
rich resources materials, with over one hundred thousand books and
a large collection of maps, microfilms and official documents. The
Library receives and maintains 600 periodical titles. It has in-house
computer systems with fifteen terminals/computers, half of which
support data entry and retrieval in Hindi. Library has CD-ROM
workstation and CD-ROM Data Bases on foreign affairs and current
affairs. The library is also equipped with CD-Writer, a colour scanner
(with OCR capability as well as facility for storage and retrieval of
images), a micro film/fiche reader printer, a plain paper photocopier,
as well as a VTR and colour monitor and a laser printer with Desk
Top publishing (DTP) software. This has enabled better presentation
of publication and documents of the Division. The Library has
INTERNET and E-Mail facilities. These are being gradually made
available to visiting users who include research scholars and former
foreign service officers. Documentation/Bibliographic services as well
as other Library operations and services have been computerized,
using an integrated library software package. Information on all

Annual Report 2000-2001

books, maps, documents and selected periodical articles received in
the library since 1986 (pre-1986 publications in active use) are available
on-line through each terminal/computer in Patiala House, in the
Ministrys headquarters in South Block and in Akbar Bhawan through
network in operation in these buildings. Librarys information
databases can also be accessed on Internet in MEA librarys website
by eligible users including our officials in our Missions abroad. All
new documents received in the library-books, maps, micro films,
selected articles from periodicals are being fed in to the in-house
computer system to create a data base on foreign affairs.
Using these database and CD-ROM Data Bases, the library
provides current awareness service and bibliographical and reference
services. In addition, the library regularly issues Foreign Affairs
Documentation Bulletin- monthly list of selected periodical articles
mostly with abstracts, Recent Additions and annotated monthly
list of publications added to the Library, and fortnightly Chronicle
of Events. Library users include research scholars are welcome to

access the on-line computer based information in the library in
different data bases, including CD-ROM data bases, and the Foreign
Affairs Information Retrieval System (FAIRS). Photocopy and
computer printout facilities are also available to all library users
including research scholars.
After completing generation of Full Text Database of Ministrys
Annual Report from 1948-49 to 1998-99 and Foreign Affairs Record
from 1955-June, 1999 on a CD-ROM, the library has also begun full
text conversion of some more important publications in the library
on CD-ROMs.
There are about six lakh files, both classified and unclassified,
lying in the Records Management Section of the Ministry. The Section
has been sending old files for reviewing regularly to the concerned
officers for taking a decision regarding retention or otherwise of these
files. One thousand seven hundred and fifty five files, which were no
longer required, have been destroyed by burning.

External Publicity

I

n tandem with Indias active engagement with all the major
powers, traditional partners and other interlocutors and in
response to challenges posed by developments in Fiji and UN
peace keeping operations in Sierra Leone, the External Publicity
Division was an active instrument of foreign policy management, of
projecting and explaining Indias perspective on foreign policy and
international security issues. Simultaneously, the External Publicity
Division also undertook the commissioning of a number of
documentary films consonant with our foreign policy priorities, the
maintenance of an updated website, supply of books for Indian
libraries abroad, publication of the monthly India Perspectives and
occasional volumes on important events and issues such as peace
keeping, monitoring the international and domestic media and
managing media related activities for the visits of the President, the
Vice-President, the Prime Minister, the External Affairs Minster and
other dignitaries.
Daily briefings conducted for the Indian and international media
in XP Division were supplemented by the issue of more than 166
press statements apart from organising special backgrounders for the
media. Understandably, there was an abiding and active interest in
timely dissemination of information particularly on high profile
incoming and outgoing visits. President Shri K.R. Narayanans visit
124

to China, Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayees visits to the
USA, Vietnam and Indonesia as well as the first India-EU Summit
caught the imagination of the world press. Visits to India by the
Presidents of USA and Russia, Prime Ministers of Japan, Greece,
Mauritius and of neighbours like Nepal and Sri Lanka and the
Chairman of the National Peoples Congress of China were some of
the large number of visits that testified to a period of hectic diplomatic
engagement. The commitment of India to bring about peace and
normalcy in the State of Jammu and Kashmir in the face of continuous
support of and abetment to cross-border terrorism was widely
recognised and applauded.
The Ministrys website served as a vital tool for dissemination of
information by the office of the Spokesman. The website was kept
updated on a daily basis to cover all developments relating to foreign
policy, disarmament & international security issues, international
terrorism, speeches and interviews of dignitaries, official spokesmans
statements, press releases, record of briefings, bilateral treaties and
agreements signed by India, other political and economic
developments, Parliament questions and answers etc. Separate
subsections were created on major visits by Heads of State and
Government, on the Foreign Service Institute and on PMs initiative
of November 2000 in Jammu and Kashmir. The website was widely

Annual Report 2000-2001

appraised and appreciated by the users, both Indian and foreign
(clocking nearly 2 million bits a month) and won recognition from
prestigious international agencies. The website was also hyper-linked
by some of the important organisations like CNN, BBC, The
Economist, etc. for information relating to India. The BBC Web Guide,
the BBCs guide to the best sites across the Web, highlighted the site
as a Top Site. MEA web site was also awarded a rank among the Top
50 Indian Sites by Indias Site Appraisal Solutions Provider
www.BestIndianSites.com. An e-mail-based media reporting system
for feedback and for retrievable storage was followed with most
missions abroad. Extensive archival material on Indias foreign policy
was loaded on the website for reference and easy retrieval.
 The Ministry of External Affairs is one of the largest producers
of documentary films in India. These films are commissioned with
the two-fold objective of long-term image building as well as focussing
the attention of the international community on current and topical
subjects relating to India. The end objective of the exercise is the
projection of India as a strong, progressive democratic nation with a
rich civilizational heritage.
During the year, a variety of documentary films were made on
subjects that dovetail into Indias foreign policy objectives. Themes
of these films were carefully selected to ensure the positive projection
of the country among target audiences abroad. These included Indian
democracy; Indias growing relations with Mauritius, Nepal, South
Africa, Central Asia and South East Asia; the spread of the Indian
Diaspora and Indias emerging might as a naval power.
 A festival of short films produced by the Ministry of External
Affairs titled Reflections was organized in New Delhi in August
2000. While special screenings and telecast of MEA documentaries
on foreign television network were organised within India as well as
by missions abroad. Indian feature film festivals were organized in
15 different countries in association with the concerned Indian

missions abroad, including in Abu Dhabi, Algiers, Berlin, Brussels,
Budapest, Hong Kong, Madrid, Moscow, Port Louis, Rabat, Addis
Ababa, Rajshahi, Tel Aviv, Vientiane and Zanzibar. Raj Kapoor
retrospectives were organized in Chicago and Minsk. Retrospectives
of Adoor Gopalakrishnan were also held in Madrid and Brussels.
Special screening of Hrishikesh Mukherjees films was held in Dhaka.
The Ministrys existing collection of feature films was
supplemented through purchase of additional titles including old
classics as well as recent films that have won acclaim. An exhibition
on Indian cinema through film posters and film stills was held at the
Berlin Film Festival. A special screening of M.F. Hussains film Gaja
Gamini was organised for a select audience of foreign diplomats and
foreign media persons based in Delhi.
Audio-visual material, including CD ROMs on a variety of
subjects on India and audio/video CDs of Indian music and films
were disseminated among Indian missions and posts abroad both for
their audio-visual libraries and for presentation purposes. Photo
exhibitions on India were organized in China in association with the
Indian mission.
The Ministry endeavoured to strengthen the information
infrastructure in missions abroad through acquisition of publicityrelated equipment such as DVD players, film and slide projectors,
dish antenna, CD players, TV and video cassette players, public
address systems, computers etc.
The Ministry is a nodal point for clearance of documentary
proposals by foreign TV networks. 322 such proposals were received
during the year and 90% of these were promptly approved.
As part of the ongoing programme of familiarisation visits, 95
senior journalists were invited to India from different countries
including Indonesia, Brunei, Hong Kong, Egypt, Iran Russia, United
Kingdom, Mauritius, Morocco, Turkey, Argentina, China, Nepal,
Spain, Portugal, Kenya, Vietnam, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Mongolia,
125

External Publicity

Hungary, Nigeria, Singapore, France, USA, Maldives, Germany,
Uzbekistan, Thailand, Japan, Namibia, Iceland and Saudi Arabia.
The visits led to a balanced coverage of India in foreign media as well
as an enhanced image of the country abroad. Facilitation was also
provided to other foreign media who traveled to India during the
year. Media delegations travelling with visiting Heads of States and
Governments were provided with complete logistical support and
other assistance. These included teams from Norway, Russia,
Singapore, Nigeria, Indonesia, Cambodia, Morocco, USA, Maldives,
Australia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Georgia, Japan and Iceland.
VIP visits from France, Germany, UK, China, Thailand, Oman,
South Korea and Namibia. All media arrangements relating to visits
of President, Vice-President and Prime Minister abroad were handled
successfully.
 Over 300 foreign resident correspondents were provided
accreditation facilities and other services.

126

 Several publications were brought out by the Ministry during
the year including the Foreign Affairs Record and compilation of
all press releases, agreements, speeches and significant diplomatic
developments. India Perspectives, the monthly magazine of the
Ministry was published in ten different languages for distribution
through Indian missions and posts abroad. A compendium of foreign
policy statements made by Prime Minister and the External Affairs
Minister (May 1998-2000), a book on US Presidents visit to India in
March 2000 and a compilation of presentations made at the New
Delhi Seminar on UN Peace Keeping were some of the other
publications brought out during the year. Several other publications
were in various stages of production including a book on India-EU
Summit, PMs visit to USA and Russian Presidents visit to India.

Passport, Visas and Consular Services

T

he interface of the Ministry of External Affairs with the public
is through passports for Indian nationals, visas for foreign
nationals and consular services to Indian nationals abroad. In
the present age of increased foreign travel and frequent movement
across borders for employment, pleasure, studies, etc., the issue of a
passport is a pre-requisite for the individual to become a global citizen.
Through its activities the Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division
directly assists the export of Indian manpower, expertise and
technology abroad.

Passport Services
During the year, the Central Passport Organisation worked with
the twin objective of meeting the expectations of the passport
applicants and modernizing the working of the Passport Offices.
Efforts continued to fulfill the Governments commitments under
the Citizens Charter through various innovative measures for
providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 passport
offices. Five new Passport Collection Centres were opened at Tirupati,
Vijaywada, Siliguri, Pondicherry and at MEA Branch Office at
Calcutta during the year. More outlets were opened for printing,
distribution and sale at a nominal price of passport application forms
for convenience of the passport applicants.

Passport offices at Bangalore, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Lucknow and
Chennai launched their websites, which carry all the rules, regulations
etc. for passport, visa and PIO cards and carry information about the
status of application submitted at that particular Passport Office.
Annual Passport Officers Conference was held on 1-3 July 2000
in Bangalore at which emphasis was placed on reforming and
revamping the procedures to make the system more productive and
efficient. There was special emphasis on the redressal of public
grievances and the practice of periodical Passport Adalats was
continued at most Passport Offices.
Several measures were initiated to simplify and streamline various
procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous
services promptly and efficiently in keeping with the commitment
under the Citizens Charter. The Tatkaal Scheme for out-of-turn
issue of passports launched has been very successful. It has enabled
the system to speedily respond to public demand and has also
generated substantial additional revenue for the Government.
The genuine need of an illiterate passport applicant for assistance
in filling up a passport application form has been recognised.
Associations of ex-servicemen have been approached to open
facilitation counters at some Passport Offices where they would assist
the applicants on the payment of a small fee. Such counters have

131

Passport, Visas and Consular Services

already started functioning at the Passport offices in Jalandhar,
Trichirapallai, Bangalore and New Delhi.
The Passport Manual (1983) has been thoroughly revised and
updated and has been given for printing.
The rules for issue of passports to minors, single or unwed
mothers, officials with criminal cases for actions taken in the line of
duty, asylum seekers in foreign countries etc. were revised to facilitate
and streamline issue of passports in such cases.
At most Passport Offices, concrete measures were taken to
increase amenities for the applicants/visitors by increasing the number
of public counters, augmenting air-conditioning, installation of water
coolers, provision of chairs etc.
At present 20 of the 28 passport offices have been computerised.
These are Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bareilly, Bhopal, Calcutta,
Chandigarh, Chennai, Cochin, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jalandhar,
Kozhikode, Lucknow, Mumbai, Panaji, Pune, Trichirapalli,
Thiruvananthapuram and Vishakhapatnam. The remaining 8 Passport
Offices would be computerised by the end of 2001.
E-mail facility is available at all computerised passport offices.
Tele enquiry system is in operation at all the computerised passport
offices except Pune and Bhopal for which a software upgradation is
underway. Websites have also been established at Bangalore, Chennai,
Chandigarh, Bhopal and Lucknow. A proposal for a comprehensive
computerised network and connectivity as well as creation of a
Central Processing Cell is now under implementation.
It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house
the Passport Office in Government owned properties. At present
Passport Offices buildings at five places (Mumbai, Cochin,
Kozhikode, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad )are owned by MEA, at five
places are owned by Central Government/State Government and
are rented in 18 places. The Passport Office at Ahmedabad was shifted
to a new building owned by MEA during the year. MEA has acquired
plots of land/built-up properties in various cities in India and
132

construction work is in progress at six places viz. Bangalore, Calcutta,
Cochin (residential complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji and
Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for purchase of land
or construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been continuing
at six other places i.e. Lucknow, Jaipur, Thiruvananthapuram,
Chandigarh, Trichirapallai, and Jammu. In Chennai space in an office
complex has been purchased and possession would be taken over in
a few months. At Mumbai additional office space has been hired to
relieve overcrowding and increase amenities for the public.
The number of applications received during the year for grant of
passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of
name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. were high
given the overall climate of economic liberalization and increased
travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 22,43,033 passports
were issued and 2,57,654 miscellaneous services were rendered (up to
31 December 2000). During the year 2000, detailed figures of receipts
of passports issued/services rendered including the revenue and
expenditure of Passport Offices are at Annexure-IV.
In an innovative breakthrough, the completed passport
applications will now be received through the network of Speed
Post Centres under the Department of Posts. It is proposed to further
expand this network through nationalized banks.
Action is being taken to introduce modern management practices
in the passport issue system. Services of a management expert have
been obtained as a Consultant for a management and process study
of a few Passport Offices to come out with a model training-cummotivational programme for the CPO personnel.

PIO Cards
The six million Indian Citizens and an estimated 14 million People
of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have been playing an
increasingly important role for the furtherance of Indias foreign
policy. Recognising their significant role in projecting Indian nationals
interests abroad, the Government had, in March 1999, launched the

Annual Report 2000-2001

PIO Card Scheme for Persons of Indian Origin settled in countries
specified by the Government. This has, besides introducing a visa
free regime, also conferred some special economic, educational,
financial and cultural benefits. Because of various reasons including
a perception of high fee, the number of PIO cards issued so far has
not been large. This is being looked into by the Government.

Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad are sensitive to the consular needs
of Overseas Indians. All Missions and Posts are geared to provide
efficient and timely assistance on all days and at all hours. Problems
encountered by Non-Resident Indians/workers, especially in the Gulf
countries, including disputes with their employers/sponsors are being
redressed through the labour wings in their offices. Government
maintained contacts with the Governments of the Gulf countries,
including through the institutional mechanism of the Joint
Commissions, with the objective of resolving consular problems and
ameliorating the conditions of Indian workers in those countries. In
cases of deaths of Indians abroad, assistance continued to be arranged
by our Missions and Posts for completing the formalities for early
despatch of the mortal remains, liaison with the local and Indian
authorities and keeping the relatives of the deceased informed.
During the year, 9,243 Indians were arrested abroad and 3,143
deaths of Indians abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary
of the consular data for the year 2000 is at Annexure-V.

Visas
Over the years, the procedure for grant of visa by our Missions
and Posts has been streamlined. Many Missions and Posts give visas
either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas
within 48 hours.
A project for computerisation of the Consular Wings of the
Missions and Posts in the Gulf, West Europe and North America
has been initiated and a contract has been awarded to a private

company. First those Missions and Posts would be computerised
where the volume of services rendered is high. Separately, NIC has
been working on the computerisation of the consular wings of HCI,
Dhaka and Colombo.
Indias 152 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to
7,34,256 foreigners during the period from 1 January 2000 to 30 June
2000.
Visa fees for all categories of visa have been increased by 30 per
cent with effect from 1 October, 2000 as (i ) there has been a 30% rise
in cost of living in dollar terms since 1991; (ii) expenditure on consular
wings abroad has gone up; and (iii) MEA is embarking on a major
computerisation drive at Consular Wings of all important Missions/
Posts abroad.

Bilateral Agreements
To build an institutional framework to combat organized crime,
international terrorism and drug trafficking, and acknowledging the
growing international dimensions of financial and other crimes,
bilateral agreements are being negotiated with several countries to
provide legal under-pinning to international endeavour. These
consular agreements include Extradition Treaties, Agreement on
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Agreements on Mutual
Legal Assistance in Civil Matters and Consular Conventions.
During the visit of the President of Uzbekistan to India in May
2000, two agreements - Extradition Treaty and an Agreement on
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal matters were signed. Extradition
Treaty with Tunisia was signed in the month of April 2000 in Tunisia.
During the visit of the President of Mongolia in January 2001,
Extradition Treaty, Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in
Criminal matters and Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil
& Commercial matters were signed. Extradition Treaties with U.A.E.
and Russia were notified in the Gazette of India and are in force
w.e.f. 29.5.2000 and 30.5.2000 respectively. Extradition Treaties were
initialled at official level with Phillipines and Turkey in November
133

Passport, Visas and Consular Services

2000 and December 2000 respectively. The Extradition Treaties
initialled with Oman and Poland are being finalized for signatures
with respective countries. Work on Extradition Treaties with
Australia, Bahrain, Japan, South Africa and Sudan was initiated.
During the year, official delegations visited USA, Kazakhstan
and Phillipines to negotiate Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance
in Criminal matters. Progress has been made in ongoing negotiations
on similar agreements with Hong Kong, Tajikistan and Poland.
An Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil matters was
initialled with Russia; and negotiations were initiated with Kazakhstan
and Singapore in this area.
An agreement with Uruguay on visa exemption for the holders
of diplomatic and official passport holders signed in December,1999
has been ratified and brought into effect with effect from 31
August,2000. Moreover, bilateral agreements on visa exemption for
diplomatic and official passport holders were negotiated with several
countries, which include Schengen countries, Turkey and Morocco.
The Ministry actively follows requests for extradition and other
legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal and civil
and commercial charges. The requests for extradition emanate from
our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or Extradition
Arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year
20 requests for extradition and 61 requests for legal assistance were
received in addition to the ongoing cases.

134

During the year, 2,96,735 documents were accorded consular
attestation in CPV Division of which 1,70,400 were commercial
documents. This service is rendered on the same day, is without any
charge and is prompt and efficient.

Central Passport Organisation (CPO)
The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) are
running the 28 Passport Offices and 20 existing Passport Collection
Centres. The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1543 with 176 Officers
and 1,367 non-gazetted staff. One of the major demands of the
employees has been for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is
stagnation at various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review-cumcreation of posts is under the consideration of the Government. The
Staff Inspection Unit of the Ministry of Finance has conducted a
study to assess the workload of the Passport Offices.

Vision
The Consular, Passport and Visa work is the public face of the
Ministry of External Affairs. The public expects prompt and
courteous service with minimal delays. The mission of the Ministry
is to expand the network of contact points from where services can
be delivered, go in for massive computerisation  both for processing
and storage of data and to achieving a level of satisfaction of which it
can be proud.

Non Resident Indians and People of Indian Origin Overseas

T

he NRI/PIOs Division was established in April 2000.
This was in response to a long-standing demand of the
Overseas Indian community for a separate Ministry or
Department to serve as a focal point and single contact point on
NRI/PIOs matters.

people of Indian origin/Indian citizens residing abroad in over 100
countries. Indian Diaspora is the only Diaspora with the history of
peaceful migrations. In ancient times they conquered on the strength
of the cultural and civilizational heritage and values and the healing
powers of Ayurveda.

An Indian Overseas Cell had earlier been established in 1977 as a
part of the Policy Planning Division, to study the problems of people
of Indian origin settled abroad. This experiment was repeated in 1984.
The OI Cell, were however discontinued and merged with the
Consular Division. The Commissioner for NRI functioned with the
Ministry of Finance and India Investment Centre.

The descendents of those who set out for distinct lands as cultural
and spiritual messengers in the distant past, have merged with the
indigenous people in South-East and East Asia and cannot any more
be identified as Indians.

The Government felt that the approach to NRI/PIOs could not
be merely investment centred. A wider multi-faceted approach was
needed, including political, cultural, economic, consular and other
matters.
The Government took a major initiative to create a new Division
in MEA in April 2000 and decided to transfer the office of
Commissioner (NRI), Ministry of Finance under MEAs jurisdiction.
(In practice, this arrangement has not become operational and the
Commissioners office functions independently of the MEA.)

Historical Background
The Indian Diaspora comprises of approximately 18 million

There are different categories of Indian migrants. The first
category in modern times, were the indentured labour sent by the
British to countries like Surinam, Guyana, Trinidad & Tabago, Fiji
and Mauritius etc. A second category were the migrations of
professionals to North America, Canada and some countries of
Europe where they have adapted themselves to the social and
economic structures while maintaining their culture, heritage and
links with the mother countries.
A third category of overseas Indians are legally branded stateless
persons of Indian origin. These include children entered in migrant
parents passports which were later destroyed or lost; and many other
cases where no documentary proofs exist to substantiate their Indian
origin. This category is fast disappearing.
135

Non Resident Indians and People of Indian Origin Overseas

Another categorization could be of the Indian citizens staying
abroad for indefinite period (employment, business, governmental
assignment or working in international organizations). They have
been identified as the Non Resident Indian (NRI) in the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act 1973. This is a recent category relatively,
and a 20 century phenomenon, reflecting a voluntary response to
the demand for labour to fuel faster development, initially in post
world war-II Europe and than in the newly oil rich countries in West
Asia. IN later years it become an exodus of technically and
professionally qualified personnel to the advanced developed
countries. Many of them ceased to be NRIs on acquiring citizenship
in the host countries. The second category are chiefly descendents of
the migrants of indentured labour taken by the British in the early
19 century to various parts of the empire to develop the lands or
enrich the metropolis . They are found in over 100 countries spread
over in all continents. The largest concentration of PIO (persons of
India origin) are to be found in Fiji, Malaysia, Burma, Sri Lanka,
Mauritius, East and Central Africa and West Indies. They are also
several million PIOs in Nepal owing to the open border that Nepal
has with India.

NRI/PIOs have gained political and economic clout in several
countries such as USA, UK and Canada where they have projected
our political and other concerns to opinion-builders and decisionmakers. They have a combined income equal to Indias GDP
(approximately US$ 300 billion); technical skills at advanced levels
and expertise in frontier technologies such as information technology
and bio-technology where they have secured global recognition; They
have expertise in key services such as education, health, banking,
management and consultancy and vast wealth and business
entrepreneurial skills where they can contribute in key areas to Indias
development and Indias socio-economic transformation to an advance
and modern economy and society.

These communities gradually gained comparative affluence
through hard work but earned the animosity of native population.
As the victims of racism/animosity they were compelled to stay
together and preserve their Indian culture, religion and ways. In South
Africa they were victimized by the British and were suspect in the
eyes of black Africans. They held fast and are now an important
element in South Africa and its government.

There are PIO Prime Ministers/Presidents (Mauritius, Guyana
and Trinidad and Tobago and Singapore) and several hundred
Ministers and Parliamentarians.

Objectives of the Division
NRI/PIOs have had a deep impact on Indias political and
economic development through history. Mahatma Gandhi was an
NRI for several years. They are an important factor in our foreign
policy and have a bearing on bilateral relations with India where
there is a sizeable Indian community.
136

They contribute generously in times of national crisis, e.g. the
Resurgent India Bond which exceeded its target by 100%, following
the economic sanctions on India, the recent equally successful India
Millennium Bonds, national disasters such as the Orissa cyclone and
the recent Gujarat earthquake.
The vast Indian labour force in the Gulf has been a major source
of remittance which are crucial to our foreign exchange reserves and
our economy.

NRI/PIOs face many problems in their countries of adoption as
well as in India. Mainly these pertain to harassment in immigration/
emigration procedures, excessive checks and control in their travel/
stay, inadequate legal and Constitutional protection in host countries,
problems regarding education of their children in India; problems
regarding cultural facilities for maintaining their Indian cultural
identity and problems of assimilation with the host societies; racial
and other discrimination in several host countries; They have
expressed difficulties in freely investing their resources in India owing
to infrastructural and bureaucratic bottlenecks. Absence of dual
nationality is a widely expressed grievance. (Govt. has not granted
this so far on security considerations, although a review is being done);

Annual Report 2000-2001

NRI/PIOs complain of inadequate recognition through honours and
awards for contributions by them to the motherland.

(c) Study the role that the PIOs and NRIs may play in the economic
and social and technological development of India;

NRI/PIOs look to India for protection and help for their
problems and in time of crises.

(d) Examine the current regime that governs the travel and stay of
PIOs in India and investments by PIOs in India, and recommend
measures to resolve the problems faced by NRIs in these areas;

MEA in June 2000 announced that Government had all along
attached considerable importance to the Indian Diaspora and their
relations with the motherland. The concerns, needs and problems of
the overseas Indian communities and their potential for contributing
to Indias socio-economic and technological transformation to an
advanced and modern economy and society are matters of priority
concern. Encouragement of cultural and emotional bonds and
strengthening of the same is a shared objective of the overseas Indian
community and the Indian Government. Government would also
encourage them to contribute to strengthening of bilateral relations
with counties in which they reside.

High Level Committee on Indian Diaspora
Another major initiative taken by Government was the
establishment of a High Level Committee, approved by PM, on the
Indian Diaspora, under the Chairmanship of Dr.L.M.Singhvi (Cabinet
rank), M.P and former High Commissioner to the UK. The
Committee will look into the entire range of issues concerning
overseas Indian community with a view to suggesting policy and
organizational frameworks. It will also recommend country-specific
plans of action. The Committee commenced its work on September
1, 2000 and will submit its report in six months. Terms of Reference
of the Committee are as follows:
(a) Review the status of Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and NonResident Indians (NRIs) in the context of constitutional
provisions, Laws and rules applicable to them both in India and
the countries of their residence;
(b) Study the characteristics, aspirations, attitudes, requirements,
strengths and weaknesses of Indian Diaspora and their
expectations from India;

(e) Recommend a broad but flexible policy framework and country
specific plans for forging a mutually beneficial relationship with
the region or PIOs and NRIs, and for facilitating their interaction
with India and their participation in Indians economic
development.
The Committee is establishing Expert Groups on all important
issues which include: education, culture, tourism, consular problems,
especially of Indian workers abroad, dual nationality; citizenship and
nationality issues, constitutional and legal provisions relating to NRI
and PIO, science and technology; trade; investment flows; banking, etc.
On behalf of the Committee NRI/PIO Division prepared an
elaborate and extensive questionnaire which was circulated to over a
100 missions and a vast amount of data and information on the
Overseas Indian communities was obtained. This has enabled the
development of a broad profile of the Indian communities all over
the world.
For the first time a numerical assessment was officially made of
strength of these communities in various countries. This may be seen
at Annex-XX.
Other information includes: the historical background of these
communities in each individual countries of residence; their strength
and weaknesses; social, economic, educational and cultural profile;
the nature and extent of existing cultural activities for maintenance
of the Indian identity; contribution of these communities to host
countries and to India as well as to promotion of bilateral relations;
extent of integration with the mainstream host societies; the principal
associations of Overseas communities; rosters of prominent members
of the Overseas communities/ experts in important areas; list of

139

Administration and Organisation

Offices of the Ministry of External Affairs in India and abroad where
the circumstances (such as high rental outgo or opportune market
conditions etc.) justify the proposed Project / purchase.

Once completed, these two Government of India properties will not
only be functionally more efficient, but will also join the list of the
most prestigious properties of Government of India abroad.

In the year 2000-2001, the Establishment Division of the Ministry
of External Affairs, within the allocated budget, monitored the routine
repair, maintenance, renovations - and beautification and
modernisation of Embassy buildings abroad and Ministry of External
Offices in India.

In the case of construction projects in India, progress was achieved.
In order to cater to the growing stature and functions of the Foreign
Service Institute, substantial progress was made in the time-consuming
preliminary stages of project implementation - especially the detailed
plans- and now the project is close to the construction stage. The
CPWD to whom the work is entrusted expects to award the work to
the Contractor by end January and complete the project by December
2002.

Under the Major Heads 4059 and 4216 i.e. Capital Outlay for
Public Works and Housing respectively, the Establishment Divisions
allocation was Rs. 90 Crores. Within the above allocation, projects
already in the initial stages of execution were prioritised for allocation
of funds - chiefly, the projects in Mauritius, Abu Dhabi and Berlin:
while the civil works for the Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture
(IGCIC) complex in Mauritius and the Chancery-cum-residential
complex in Abu Dhabi were completed, interior works in these two
buildings was taken up which are expected to be completed later this
financial year. The construction of the Chancery-cum Residential
Complex in Berlin was completed in January 2001.

Foreign Service Institute

T

he Foreign Service Institutes activities during the year 2000,
were:

(1) Professional Course in Diplomacy and International Relations
for Indian Foreign Service Probationers (1999 batch);
(2) Familiarisation Programme for Resident Foreign Diplomats;
(3) Orientation Course for Non-MEA Officers;
(4) Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats.
The Professional Course on Diplomacy and International
Relations for the Probationers of the Indian Foreign Service  the
most important part of FSIs work  was conducted for the 1999
batch of Indian Foreign Service Probationers, from January, 2000 to
December, 2000. The 2000 batch of Probationers commenced their
training in January 2001 after completing the Foundation Course at
the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration.
The basic objective of the Course was to provide comprehensive
training to the young Indian Foreign Service Officer  trainees in the
traditional areas of diplomacy, international relations, political
reporting and protocol and in several related fields that are growing
in importance such as national security, management challenges in
the changing global scenario and investment promotion.

142

The training programme for the 1999 batch of Indian Foreign
Service Probationers comprised of 26 modules, which dealt with
important areas of work related to foreign policy and diplomacy.
The most comprehensive module related to Indias foreign policy,
covering almost every aspect of our external relations.
In keeping with the special emphasis in recent years on economic
diplomacy, the module on International Economic Relations and
Commercial Diplomacy was strengthened. The focus was on Indias
economic reforms, the international economic missions abroad, role
of Commercial Counsellors in investment promotion, commercial
negotiations, management challenges in the changing global scenario
and international finance and capital markets. A comprehensive
programme was arranged in collaboration with Confederation of
Indian Industry and eminent speakers from Confederation of Indian
Industry briefed the probationers on above matters. This was the 2nd
year of CIIs active participation.
The module entitled New Areas of International Relations
highlighted some non-traditional areas of diplomacy, such as
Environment, Energy, Refugees, Narcotics, Terrorism and Human
Rights.
The module on Defence & Security apart from focusing on
vital security issues like nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and

Annual Report 2000-2001

arms control, also covered Indias defence policy, the state of our
armed forces, developments in defence technology and the security
of our border areas.
An additional module on Special Diplomatic Skills emphasised
negotiating skills, communications skills, use of Information
Technology, development of leadership skills and espirit de corps.
Mock sessions on negotiation skills were held.
Apart from these modules, there was a good deal of emphasis on
field visits to acquaint the probationers with the ground situation in
sensitive areas of the country such as the North-east, Jammu &
Kashmir. The Probationers were also attached with the various wings
of armed forces for training.
Continuing with the programme of visiting neighbouring
countries Indian Foreign Service Probationers visited Myanmar &
Bhutan, for a period of around one-week each.
The Institute also organised brief Orientation Programmes for
officers from other Ministries of Government of India proceeding
on posting to our Missions abroad.
The 11 th Familiarisation Programme entitled Introduction to
India for resident foreign diplomats was arranged from November
27th to 1st December. The Programme was designed to impart basic
information about India to the newly arrived diplomats & covered
topics such as the Constitution of India; organisation of MEA &
Government of India; Indias economic policy; historical legacy of
India; Indian art, music & culture, etc. 23 resident diplomats
participated in the programme.
In the period 2000-2001 FSI entered into an agreement for cooperation with the Diplomatic Academy of Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Republic of Croatia on 5th January, 2000. H.E. Dr.
Zoran Andric Amb. Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the
Republic of Croatia signed on behalf of Croatia while Dean(FSI)
Shri Dalip Mehta signed on behalf of India. FSI also signed two
Memoranda of Understanding for co-operartion : one with the

Academia Diplomatica Andre Bello of Chile on 10 August 2000 where
Mr. Mario Hernan Artaza Rouxel acting sub-secretary of the Ministry

India's Aid Programme
Aid to Bhutan accounts for 77% of Indias total aid budget. Other important destinations for Indian aid programs include
Nepal - 9% Myanmar - 3% and other countries - 11%
In addition, the Government of India has extended loans to the Governments of Bangladesh and Bhutan to assist in the
implementation of developmental projects. During 2000-2001, the loans extended to Government of Bangladesh amount
to Rs. 75 crores and to Government of Bhutan Rs. 200.80 crores.
The Budget of the Ministry of External Affairs is essentially a Non-Plan Budget. From 1996-97, however, a Plan head has
been established with the approval of the Cabinet. This is primarily to cater to certain large developmental projects, which
have been undertaken in Bhutan, as part of project assistance requested by Government of Bhutan in the Government of
Indias Aid to Bhutan Program. The Tala Hydroelectric Project currently under implementation in Bhutan is an extremely
prestigious and important project. Two other projects funds from the Plan head are the Kurichu Hydroelectric Project and
the Dungsum Cement Plan project, both in Bhutan.
The estimated expenditure on the Headquarters of the Ministry of External Affairs during the current financial year is
estimated to be of the order of Rs. 112 crores which forms about 5% of the total estimated revenue expenditure of the
Ministry. Estimated expenditure on Indian Missions and Posts abroad is expected to be of the order of Rs. 727 crores
which is about 31% of the total revenue expenditure of the Ministry.
The Ministry of External Affairs revenue from Passport and Visa fees and other receipts is likely to be of the order of Rs.
479 crores. It is estimated that Passport fees would account for about Rs. 167 crores and Visa fees for Rs. 285 crores.
