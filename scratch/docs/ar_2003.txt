Introduction

T

he main thrust of Indias foreign policy
has been to establish its rightful place
in the emerging world order. Pragmatism
and the pursuit of national interest without
compromising on basic principles have been
the guiding tenets of Indias foreign policy.
In a rapidly changing world order, foreign
policy must be flexible enough to optimally
respond to new challenges and opportunities.
Indias foreign policy cannot be seen in
isolation and must be viewed as an integral
part of the larger effort of building the
nations capabilities through economic
development, strengthening social well-being
and protecting Indias sovereignty, territorial
integrity and security not only in its defence
and economic aspects but in the widest sense
of the term. It also visualizes international
peace, stability and security as being
essentially in conjunction with its own
national interest.
The year witnessed several bilateral and
multilateral exchanges that took place at the
highest levels between India and the rest of
the world. Given the backdrop of the
changing international scenario, Indias
foreign policy is directed towards the
realization of the following objectives:
n To protect Indias core national interests

and concerns in a rapidly changing
international environment by fostering
support and understanding in the
international community.
n To preserve the autonomy of the

decision making process and to play a
pioneering role in the establishment of
a stable, prosperous and secure global
order.

economic diplomacy with the objective
of promoting foreign trade and
investment, ensuring equitable transfer
of technology and strengthening Indias
energy security.
n To work closely with P-5 countries and

to build strategic ties with the other
major powers and leading developing
countries.
n To intensify and strengthen ties with

neighbors through mutually beneficial
cooperation and by building a climate
of confidence and trust along with the
acknowledgement of each others
legitimate concerns. The realization of
SAARC as a more vibrant regional
forum leading to an economic
integration of the region is a desired goal.
n To ensure that cross-border terrorism is

brought to an end and the entire
infrastructure of terrorism operating
from Pakistan is dismantled.
n To strengthen cooperation, friendship

and trust with countries of Indias
extended neighborhood based on
civilisational and historical ties as well
as strong contemporary relevance. India
and the countries of this region stand
together to promote economic
development and durable peace.
n To further the gains from Indias Look

East Policy and aspire for substantive
progress in several areas of common
interest to India and ASEAN.
n To constructively engage other members

campaign against terrorism which is a
global threat.

of multilateral institutions and
organisations to generate common
approaches to contemporary challenges
relating to economic well-being and
development.

n To give greater focus and priority to

n To leverage trends towards regionalism

n To strengthen the international

and sub-regionalism for promoting
economic growth and all-round
development with active coordination
and assistance to organisations like
BIMST-EC and the Mekong Ganga
Cooperation.
n To continue to work closely with

international bodies like the UN, NAM,
the Commonwealth and regional
groupings like the EU and G-20 for
furthering Indias interests in the
international arena.
n To refor m and restructure the UN

Security Council and espouse
multipolarity in a world order that
respects the principles of sovereignty and
non-intervention.
n To promote a more equitable equation

between the developed and the
developing world in the political,
economic and technological domains.
n To work towards the goal of global

nuclear disarmament within a time
bound framework.
n To closely interact with the Indian

Diaspora on a continuing basis in order
to strengthen their bonds with India and
to recognize their pivotal role in Indias
international relations.
The conduct of Indias foreign policy is
based on a holistic assessment that
encompasses all the above objectives, and
also imparts a greater dynamism to its foreign
policy. The increasing pace of bilateral and
regional engagements at the highest levels
are an ample testimony to the pragmatism
and pro-active approach it seeks to
epitomize. Indias foreign policy is aimed at
a vision for the future, a vision that seeks to
establish Indias deserved place in the
international arena.

Synopsis

B

hutan and India share extensive and
mutually beneficial bilateral relations.
There is free movement of people and goods
between the two countries, and the Indian
Rupee is legal tender in Bhutan. 90% of
Bhutans global trade is with India. India has
played a pivotal role in the socio-economic
development of Bhutan. Their first two Five
Year Plans during 1961-66 and 1966-71
were financed entirely by India. Indias
contribution to Bhutans development
budget during 1961 to 2002 is close to 30%.
Indian assistance to Bhutans ongoing Ninth
Five Year Plan is continuing. India has
already created over 400MW of generation
capacity in Bhutan that is also catering to
the needs of India. The Tala mega project
of 1020MW capacity will come on stream
in early 2006,and will export power to India.
India has signed an agreement with Bhutan
in September 2003 to prepare the Detailed
Project Report (DPR) of Punatsangchhuk
Hydroelectric Project with a capacity of
900MW. M/s Water & Power Consultants
of India have commenced work on the DPR.
Bhutan is making significant strides in the
devolution and decentralisation of authority
to the grass roots level. On 15 December
2003, Royal Gover nment of Bhutan
launched its operations against Indian
insurgent groups, which had taken refuge in
Bhutan. Thirty camps of the militants were
destroyed in this operation.
India and Nepal share extensive bilateral
relations. An open border of 1860kms
between the two countries facilitates free
movement of goods and people. Indian
Rupee is a legal tender in Nepal. Over 62%
of Nepals global trade is with India, and
nearly half of the Foreign Direct Investment
in Nepal originates from India. India is
building an optical fibre cable along the
Nepalese Terai, which will bring significant
improvement
in
our
bilateral
communications. The National Hydro
Power Corporation of India on a Build,
Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis,
has taken up the 300MW upper Karnali
hydroelectric project. India has also agreed
to prepare the Detailed Project Report on
the 600 MW Burhi Gandaki for possible
"

implementation in the future. Nepal has
assured India that it will not allow its territory
to be used for activities inimical to Indias
interests. Nepal has been a victim of Maoist
insurgency for the last seven years. India has
condemned the Maoist violence and
continues to extend assistance for the
strengthening of the Nepalese security
forces. India has noted developments,
including announcement of a ceasefire in
January 2003, and believes that the conflict
should be resolved through a dialogue based
on national consensus and should involve all
political parties.
India has close ties with its eastern and
southern neighbours, Bangladesh, Maldives,
Myanmar and Sri Lanka. All these countries
are of strategic importance to India and
share cultural and ethnic legacies with us.
India has focused on strengthening its
relations with these countries through
economic cooperation. This includes grant
of unilateral tariff concessions to
Bangladesh, collaborative projects including
implementation of
infrastructure
development projects in Myanmar,
cooperation in health, education and tourism
sectors in Maldives, and close economic
integration with Sri Lanka.
Interaction with China, which is based on
the principles of Panchsheel, mutual
sensitivity to each others concerns and
equality, has developed due to a mutual
agreement to qualitatively enhance bilateral
interaction while simultaneously addressing
differences through dialogue and peaceful
means. The commitment to build a broadbased and cooperative relationship with
China was further emphasised in 2003-04
following the Prime Ministers visit to China
from 22-27 June 2003.
Apart from Prime Minister, other high level
visits to China included that of the Speaker
of Lok Sabha, the Raksha Mantri and
External Affairs Minister. Minister for
Commerce and Industry also visited China
for the inauguration of the Made in India
Show organized jointly by the Embassy of
India and CII. High-level visits from China
included those of the Chairman of the

Chinese Peoples Political Consultative
Committee (CPPCC), Jia Qinglin, and
Politburo Member, He Guoqiang. A
Dialogue on Policy Planning and annual
meetings at the Foreign Minister level were
added this year to the framework of
structured interaction with China.
Interaction with China in diverse sectors,
including defence, bilateral trade and
economic cooperation progressed during the
year.
India continued with its effort to develop a
relationship of mutual trust, friendship and
cooperation with Pakistan. In keeping with
this spirit, in April 2003, once again a hand
of friendship was extended to Pakistan.
Following this, there were several significant
developments, including restoration of
relations at the level of High Commissioners,
restoration of communication and transport
links, and a virtual explosion in people to
people contacts between the two countries.
At the same time it was made clear to
Pakistan that sustainability of the process
required an end to cross border terrorism.
In the Joint Press Statement issued on 6
January 2004, President Musharraf
reassured Prime Minister Vajpayee that he
will not permit any territory under Pakistans
control to be used to support terrorism in
any manner. The two sides agreed to
commence the process of the Composite
Dialogue. Subsequently, during Joint
Secretary and Foreign Secretary level talks
in February 2004, the two sides agreed to a
schedule of meetings including eight subjects
under the Composite Dialogue.
A ceasefire along the International Border,
Line of Control, and the Actual Ground
Position Line in Jammu and Kashmir, which
is being observed since November 25, 2003
has continued to hold. Though there has
been some decline in cross border
infiltration, Pakistan is yet to take credible
steps to dismantle the infrastructure of
support to terrorism.
India remains committed to build upon the
confidence that has been generated by recent
developments in our bilateral relations.
However, in order to take forward and

Synopsis

sustain the dialogue process, violence,
terrorism and hostility must be prevented.
India-Afghanistan ties continued to expand
and strengthen during 2003-04. There were
regular bilateral exchanges, including the
state visit of President Hamid Karzai in
March 2003. The government has made
substantial contribution to Afghanistans
reconstruction effort, which includes a wide
range of humanitarian, financial and project
assistance. Indias present commitment adds
up to US$ 400 million, including 1 million
tonnes of wheat as Food Assistance. Of the
US$100 million financial assistance, US$ 85
million has already been operationalised.
India also continued to participate in various
international efforts aimed at addressing
political and reconstruction issues in
Afghanistan. Although the Afghan
government faces many challenges, the
foremost being a threat to its internal
security, developments in Afghanistan since
the Bonn Agreement of December 2001 can
be assessed as being positive.
Following the visit of President Seyyed
Mohammad Khatami to India in January
2003, India and Iran agreed to impart a
strategic character to their relationship on
the basis of the vision contained in the New
Delhi Declaration. Regular high-level
exchanges, strategic dialogue and
institutional linkages between the two
countries have led to enhanced mutual
understanding between the two countries.
Fields of energy, transit, trade and economy
and science and technology are among the
focused areas of bilateral cooperation.
The 12th SAARC Summit held at
Islamabad from 4-6 January 2004 was a
milestone in regional cooperation. Three
important Agreements were signed at the
Summit: the SAARC Social Charter, the
Additional Protocol on Terrorism and the
Framework Agreement on South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA).
India continued to pursue closer relations
with South East Asia in line with the Look
East policy. Regular exchange of high-level
visits and interactions at regional and
international fora helped in imparting added

dynamism to Indias relations with these
countries. Prime Minister visited Thailand
from 8-12 October 2003 following his visit
to Bali, Indonesia, where he attended the
Second India-ASEAN Summit. Prime
Minister of Singapore, General Secretary of
the Communist Party of Vietnam, and
Prime Minister of Laos visited India during
the year. The initiatives taken by India at the
Second India-ASEAN Summit confirmed its
commitment to forge closer links at the
regional level. As far as the Pacific region is
concerned, following Indias admission as a
dialogue partner of the Pacific Islands Forum
(PIF), India participated for the first time in
the Post Forum Dialogue Meetings with the
PIF in Wellington in August 2003.
This year saw progress in bilateral relations
between India and Japan, in pursuance of
Indias continuing efforts to operationalise
the India-Japan Global Partnership in the
21st Century agreed to between the two
Prime Ministers in August 2000. Apart from
various high-level visits, including those of
the Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister
of State for Defence, and Indias National
Security Advisor and Minister for
Disinvestment, Communications & IT, two
rounds of Foreign Office Consultations were
held as well as the second round of the IndiaJapan Comprehensive Security Dialogue.
The first Indian IT exhibition was held in
Japan in June, and various events were
organised to mark the 100th anniversary of
the establishment of the Indo-Japanese
Association, which has a long history of
promoting exchanges between India and
Japan.
On 10 December 2003, India and Republic
of Korea (ROK) celebrated the 30th
anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations. Bilateral relations also
progressed during 2003-04, including the 4th
India-ROK Joint Trade Committee Meeting
co-chaired by the Indian Minister for
Commerce and Industry, the second meeting
of the India-ROK Joint Commission at the
Foreign Ministers level, and other high-level
visits and functional exchanges.
Bilateral relations with Democratic Peoples

Republic of Korea (DPRK) continued on an
even key, including commemorative activities
to mark the 30th anniversary of
establishment of diplomatic relations
between India and DPRK. Foreign Office
Consultations were held and the Cultural
Exchange Programme (CEP) between the
two countries for the period 2003-2006 was
renewed.
Various high-level visits, including that of
Minister of State for External Affairs to
Mongolia, and that of the Mongolian Prime
Minister and Defence Minister to India,
served to give new impetus to Indias
relationship with Mongolia in 2003-04.
Prime Ministers visit to Tajikistan in
November 2003 was the first such high level
visit to independent Tajikistan. In September
2003, Prime Minister visited Turkey, the
earlier such visit being in 1988. The
President of Kyrgyzstan visited India in
November 2003. These visits are witness to
Indias commitment and engagement in the
region. A number of other visits at political,
business and cultural levels were exchanged
to accelerate the momentum of Indias
relationship. India is now connected by air
links with Turkey, and with each of the
Central Asian states. All the Central Asian
states also have diplomatic missions in New
Delhi now. Trade relations as also peopleto-people contacts have shown a steady
progress during the period.
The Gulf region constitutes an important
area in the geo-strategic matrix of India since
it meets sixty percent of Indias oil
requirements and has a 3.5 million strong
Indian Diaspora contributing to our foreign
exchange reserve through their remittances.
The political dialogue with Gulf
Cooperation Council, initiated in September
2003 at Foreign Ministers level, and the
GCC-India Industrial Conference held in
Mumbai in February 2004 with the
participation of members from all the six
GCC countries go a long way in further
strengthening Indias long standing relations
with the region.
Indias engagement with the West Asia and
North Africa (WANA) region got further
#

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

consolidated by several visits exchanged at
Summit and other levels. India received
President of Djibouti and Prime Minister of
Israel. Similarly, the Indian President and
Prime Minister paid State Visits to Sudan
and Syria respectively. In addition,
ministerial delegations were received from
Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Israel, Sudan and
Palestine. Trade and economic interchanges
also continued to grow.
As part of the renewed Focus Africa policy,
Ministry took fresh initiatives to strengthen
the existing links between India and subSaharan African countries. There was
special focus on strengthening high-level
exchanges between the sub-Saharan African
countries and India. Heads of State/
Government from a large number of African
countries including Zambia, Mauritius,
Namibia, Mozambique, Lesotho, South
Africa, Senegal and Rwanda paid successful
visits to India. Joint Commission Meetings
at Ministerial Level were held with countries
such as Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, South
Africa, Tanzania and Seychelles. Meetings
at Permanent Secretary level were also held.
The Vice President of India paid a State visit
to Seychelles. These visits helped get a better
understanding of the position of these
countries on issues such as Indias
candidature to the permanent membership
of the expanded UN Security Council, cross
border terrorism, and Jammu and Kashmir.
They also helped to strengthen economic
and commercial links with African countries.
In order to foster links with the fast emerging
regional organizations in Africa,
Memoranda of Understanding for
Cooperation were signed between India and
regional organizations such as Southern
African Development Community (SADC),
Common Market for East and Southern
African and East African Community. As
part of its traditional technical and
humanitarian assistance to Africa, the Africa
Division made arrangements for donation of
nearly 100,000 tonnes of food aid to African
countries which had been adversely affected
by drought. This is the first time ever that
such a large quantity of food aid was shipped
to African countries in a single calendar year.
$

In addition, action was initiated to donate
anti-HIV/AIDS drugs to African countries
severely affected by the scourge of AIDS.
This is expected to promote Indian exports
of pharmaceuticals to African countries.
Indias engagement with the countries in
Western Europe continued to be broadbased and intensive. Bilateral political and
economic interaction was marked by an
unprecedented number of exchanges of
visits, demonstrating a mutual desire to
consolidate a dynamic, multi-faceted
relationship with the European Union and
the individual countries in Western Europe.
Regular exchange of views on the challenges
facing India and the European Union, and
dialogue with key strategic partners in
Western Europe, against the backdrop of
current regional and international
developments, led to a better appreciation
of Indias legitimate concerns and, at the
same time, provided an opportunity to refocus, strengthen and re-vitalize bilateral ties.
Indias strategic partnership and our multidimensional cooperation with Russia
continued to be consolidated during the year
2003-04. Prime Ministers visit to Russia in
May and November 2003 gave a fresh
impetus to friendly bilateral relations. The
system of summit- level meetings has
provided us with an annual platform to
discuss international and regional issues and
to review the state of bilateral relations.
These summit meetings are supported by
political and official level meetings which
cover the entire gamut of our bilateral
relationship. India has one of the largest
cooperation programmes on S&T with
Russia. There is a wide-ranging energy
cooperation programme. The contract for
the acquisition of the aircraft carrier,
Admiral Gorshkov was signed during the
visit of the Russian Defence Minister to India
in January 2004.
Bilateral ties with Central and Eastern
European countries were strengthened in the
past year, especially in the spheres of
economy, science, technology, culture and
defence. The Presidents visit to Bulgaria in
October 2003 reinforced our bilateral ties.

Visits by Heads of State/Heads of
Gover nment from Poland, Hungary,
Armenia and Romania during the year
helped to consolidate our bilateral relations
and embark on new areas of functional
cooperation.
As committed by their respective leaders
since their Summit Meeting of 9 November
2001, India and the United States remained
deeply engaged in 2003 to qualitatively
transfor m their bilateral relations in
recognition of Indias status as an emerging
world power and of the many common
strategic interests that the two countries share
in Asia and beyond. The two countries
constructively engaged across a full spectrum
of issues: combating international terrorism,
peacekeeping, defence, strategic issues,
science and technology, health, trade, space,
energy and environment. The most visible
symbol of this bilateral engagement is the
high frequency of bilateral visits at political
and official levels, and the existence of
Bilateral Dialogue Architecture, now
comprising more than 15 institutional
dialogues. The Prime Minister met President
Bush in New York on 24 September 2003
and briefly at St. Petersburg on 31 May 2003.
The Deputy Prime Minister visited the
United States in June 2003 when he also met
President Bush. Other high-level exchanges
included visits by the National Security
Adviser to the United States in May 2003
(which included a brief meeting with
President Bush) and by US Deputy Secretary
of State Richard Armitage in May 2003.
During the year, significant progress in
bilateral relations between India and the US
occurred in the realm of our bilateral
strategic dialogue on the Quartet Issues
comprising cooperation in civilian space
programme, civilian nuclear programme,
trade in dual use high-technology and
missile defence. During their meeting in New
York in September 2002, the Prime Minister
and President Bush agreed to explore
cooperation opportunities in these areas. In
this context, the two sides have established a
High Technology Cooperation Group
(HTCG), the first that the United States has

Synopsis

with any country. This Group met in
Washington DC in July 2003 and in New
Delhi in November 2003. During the HTCG
meetings when the two sides agreed to take
appropriate regulatory and promotional
measures to stimulate India-US hightechnology commerce, including trade in
dual-use goods and technologies. An
important milestone was crossed on 12-13
January 2004, when the leaders of the two
countries issued, in their respective capitals,
a joint statement that describes the next steps
in the India - United States strategic
partnership. These steps include an
expansion of bilateral cooperation the
Quartet Issues.
An important element emerging in this
bilateral engagement with US has been
cooperation on combating international
terrorism. On 16 October 2003, the United
States declared Dawood Ibrahim as a
Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The
designation recognizes Dawood Ibrahims
underworld and terrorist connections, his
efforts to destabilise India, his involvement
in the 1993 Mumbai bombings and his
support to LeT. This subsequently led to the
inclusion of his name in the United Nations
listing as well.
The United States conveyed its appreciation
of Indias peace initiative towards Pakistan.
While expressing hope for normalization of
relations and eventual resumption of the
India-Pakistan dialogue, the United States
maintains that it is for the two countries to
resolve all outstanding issues bilaterally. The
United States recognises that cross-border
terrorism continues, and has repeatedly
stated that it continues to press President
Musharraf to end infiltration and take action
to dismantle terrorist camps.
India and the United States also continued
their discussions on issues of regional and
international interest, including the situation
in Iraq and Afghanistan. United States
expressed its understanding of Indias
position while reiterating that India
remained an important strategic partner for
the United States. The two countries also
maintained their dialogue on developments

in Asia and beyond, and on multilateral
issues of mutual concern.
A process of re-engagement supported by
both countries marked relations between
India and Canada. Canada identified India,
together with China, Mexico and Brazil, as
one of four countries offering new
opportunities for productive partnerships, as
well as one of three countries in Asia, along
with China and Japan, for developing close
ties. The highlight of the year was the visit
of then Canadian Prime Minister, Jean
Chrètien, from 24-25 October 2003. A Joint
Statement was released on Partners for the
21st Century outlining the vision of the
Prime Ministers of both countries to
strengthen government, commercial and
civil society linkages between India and
Canada. This was preceded by the visit of
the Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham
on 13 October 2003. Visits from Canada
sought to establish an expanded interface in
the field of industry, information and
emerging technologies and agriculture and
to broaden the scope of cooperation to the
level of State Governments in India. The
traditional Throne Speech by the Governor
General of Canada, Mrs. Adrienne Clarkson
on 2 February 2004 reiterated greater focus
on Newly Emerging Economic Giants as
China, India and Brazil. The Canadian
Minister of State for New and Emerging
Markets, Mr. Gar Knutson also visited India
from 25-30 January 2004 in keeping with
this priority area of focus.
India urged the international community to
focus its attention on the threat posed by the
linkages between weapons of mass
destruction and terrorism and re-introduced
its resolution, which was first tabled in 2002,
on the subject in the UN. The resolution was
adopted by consensus, reflecting the
widespread concer n of the global
community. India continued to call for
verifiable, non-discriminatory and universal
nuclear disarmament. Indias stand on issues
related to disarmament and international
security in various multilateral and regional
forums was premised on Indias national
security interests and the nations tradition

of close engagement with the international
community. Har monisation of Indias
national imperatives and security obligations
with inter national concerns on nonproliferation and disar mament also
progressed steadily through bilateral,
regional and multilateral dialogues on
strategic issues.
The First Committee of the UNGA adopted
by consensus the Resolution moved by India
on the threat posed by the linkage between
weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
India assumed the Presidency of the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) from 1
January to 14 February 2003 on the basis of
rotation among the 66 members of the CD.
Last year was a particularly difficult one for
the UN because of the Iraq issue and the
unilateral military action taken by the US.
The very role and relevance of the UN came
under increased scrutiny. The unprecedented
attack on the UN office in Iraq highlighted
the need to focus on the threats and
challenges facing the international
community and the role of the UN in this
regard. To address these issues, the UN
Secretary General set up a High Level Panel
on Global Security, Threats and Reform of
the International System, to recommend,
inter alia, the changes necessary to ensure
effective collective action and to review the
functioning of the principal organs of the
United Nations.
India continued to play an active role in UN
debates on major issues. As a major troop
contributor, India continued to participate
in UN Peace Keeping Operations. Prime
Minister Vajpayee led the India delegation
to the 58th session of the UN General
Assembly, and inter alia, stressed the
necessity for reform and restructuring of the
UN. While emphasizing the need for
evolving suitable decision-making
mechanisms by the UN Security Council to
ensure better representation of the collective
will of the international community, the
Prime Minister strongly supported the UN
Secretary Generals call for the reform of
the institutions and processes of the United
Nations and the urgency for such a reform.

by December 2004, funded through the
grant by India of US$5 million from India.
Another project for setting up a toxicology
laboratory at the University of Kingston,
Jamaica, is currently under implementation.
Efforts to improve physical connectivity
between India and Southeast Asia are also
underway. Under the MGC, the
establishment of a rail link between New
Delhi and Hanoi has been mooted. As a first
step, the Rail India Technical & Economic
Services (RITES) Ltd. has been assigned to
undertake the pre-feasibility study of laying
the missing link of about 315 km between
Jiribam (India) and Kalay (Myanmar) and
upgrading the existing railway section in
Myanmar from Kalay to Mandalay. India
has also offered to undertake a feasibility
study on Dawei Deep Sea Port in Myanmar
and the road linkage between the Port and
Kanchanaburi in Thailand.
Ministry of External Affairs attaches great
importance to economic diplomacy in this
age of globalization to protect and promote
its economic and commercial interests. It
hence works actively with the Indian business
and chambers in this context. The Ministry
has started organizing a number of events
and activities to actively seek foreign
investment into India. The Ministry is
projecting among global investors,
businessmen, leaders, and opinion makers
the image of the new India, which is
becoming an emerging economic power.
During the year, the Policy Planning and

Research Division continued its interaction
with several academic and nongovernmental organizations, and provided
financial assistance to academic bodies and
organizations for holding seminars and

Synopsis

The Ministry continued its efforts to provide
user-friendly and efficient services in the 30
passport offices in India, as well as in the
consular wings of the Missions and Posts
abroad. Total number of services including
fresh passports and miscellaneous services
rendered by the passport offices in the
country during 2003 stood at 3.28 million
from 3.01 million in 2002, an increase of
9%. A new passport office was opened at
Surat in August 2003, increasing the number
of passport offices in the country to thirty.
With a view to decentralize issuance of
passports, District passport Cells (DPCs) have
been opened in a large number of districts
in several states. This scheme, which was
introduced in 2002, accounted for almost
10% of the applications, submitted in 2003.
The figures are expected to increase in the
coming years, as there are plans to open
more DPCs. All the thirty-passport offices
are fully computerised. The project of
scanning of passport application files and
their retention in electronic form to facilitate
easy storage and retrieval of information is
already over in most of the RPOs. Machine
writing of Passports is taking place in all
Passport offices. Training courses were
organised for the officers and staff of Central
Passport Organisation. All Missions/Posts
continuously endeavoured to meet the
consular needs of overseas Indians, resolve
their consular problems and ameliorate the
conditions of Indian workers in the Gulf
countries.
A major initiative undertaken to engage with
the Indian Diaspora was the organization of
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in New Delhi from
9-11 January 2003. Over 1900 overseas
Indians from 61 countries participated in the
celebrations.The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. In
his inaugural address, the Prime Minister
announced Governments decision to permit
dual citizenship to the Persons of Indian
Origin living in certain countries. The
Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards were
conferred for the first time by the Prime
Minister on 9 January 2003 on ten
prominent persons of the overseas Indian
community in recognition of their valuable

contribution in promoting the honour and
prestige of India and in fostering the interests
of overseas Indians.
The Bill on Dual Citizenship was passed in
the Parliament in December 2003. The
Second Pravasi Bharatiya Divas was held in
New Delhi on 9-11 January 2004. Over 1300
delegates from 61 countries participated in
the event, and twelve eminent People of
Indian Origin (PIOs) were awarded the
Pravasi Bharatiya Samman. Prime Minister
announced setting up of a Pravasi Bharatiya
Kendra in New Delhi and reservation of
seats for children of NRIs and PIOs in
Educational Institutions.
Smooth and efficient working conditions at
the Headquarters and Indian Missions/Posts
abroad remained the prime objective of the
Ministry. As part of e-governance, several
measures including development of a
personnel information system, have been
taken up. The revised Financial Powers of
Government of Indias Representatives
Abroad was brought out on a CD-ROM for
easy referencing. The number of Indian
Missions/Posts have increased to 162,
consequent upon the decision of the
Government to establish a Consulate
General of India at Birgunj (Nepal).The first
ever Cadre Review of Indian Foreign Service
Branch-B(IFS(B)) has been completed since
its inception in 1956. This would provide
much-needed relief to various IFS(B) cadre
from stagnation in their respective grades.
The Fourth Cadre Review of the Indian
Foreign Service (IFS) is also in an advanced
stage of completion.
The Coordination Division administers the
self-financing scheme for admission of
foreign students in selected professional
courses in India. This Division is also the
nodal point of the Ministry for all work
relating to Parliament, and for the clearance
of foreign tours of ministers and legislators
of the Union and State Government, and
Government officials. This Division also
handles clearance for holding international
conferences and international sports events
in India; participation by Indian sports
persons in overseas events; as well as
diplomatic clearance for all non-scheduled

flights. Observance of Anti-Terrorism Day,
Sadbhavana Diwas and Quami Ekta Week/
Diwas
and
the
processing
of
recommendations for the grant of Padma
Awards were undertaken.
The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) continued
in its endeavour to train foreign diplomats,
apart from training of IFS Probationers and
other Ministry of External Affairs officials.
Three Professional Courses for Foreign
Diplomats, an Advanced Course on Asia for
Foreign Diplomats and three separate
Special Courses for Diplomats from
Afghanistan, Lao PDR and Iraq were
conducted. FSI has also initiated an inter/
intranet-based virtual campus for a midcareer training programme. FSI has also
signed MoUs for cooperation with Foreign
Service Institutes of Palestine, Canada and
Uzbekistan.
The signing of an Agreement between India
and Mauritius on 21 November 2003, during
the visit of the Mauritian Prime Minister to
India, on the establishment of World Hindi
Secretariat at Port Louis, was another
milestone in Indias endeavour to promote
and propagate Hindi. Hindi teachers were
appointed in 28 Missions/Posts abroad to
teach Hindi to the children of Embassy and
other officials. Computers in the Ministry
and in Missions abroad have been made
bilingual to equip them to issue bilingual
documents, such as bilateral treaties, MoUs,
Credentials, Speeches of President and
Prime Minister. The Annual Report of the
Ministry and replies to Parliament Questions
were also issued bilingually. The Seventh
World Hindi Conference was organised in
Paramaribo (Suriname) from 5-9 June 2003
with Ministrys active support.
The Ministry actively fosters gender equality.

areas of public transport (274 buses
have been provided), information
technology, civil aviation (three Airbus
aircraft have been gifted to Ariana
Afghan Airlines), education, health,
agriculture, media, etc.

India had announced food assistance of 1
million tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan. A
part of this assistance is being converted into
high protein biscuits for the school-feeding
programme in Afghanistan, which is being
distributed through World Food Programme.
The delivery of the second tranche of high
protein biscuits commenced in December
2003.
As a result of this assistance 972,000
Afghan children are receiving a
package of 100 grams of biscuits from
India every day. India has gifted 300
vehicles to the Afghan National Army.
The first lot of 115 vehicles has been
delivered.

India has remained actively associated with
major international efforts on Afghanistan.
India was represented at the following
important international meetings:
n A meeting of Afghanistan Development

Forum held in Kabul from 13-14 March
2003.

n A meeting of High Level Strategic

Forum on Afghanistan held in Brussels
on 17 March 2003.

n Minister of State for External Affairs,

Shri Digvijay Singh, participated in the
International Conference on Drug
Routes held in Paris from 21-22 May
2003.

n The External Affairs Minister attended

the High Level Ad hoc Meeting on
Afghanistan, which was held on the
margins of UN General Assembly on 24
September 2003.

India has also been in regular touch with the
international community, including the
United States, Russia, Iran and European
Union member countries, on the evolving
situation in Afghanistan. There is an
appreciation and recognition in the
international community of Indias
contribution to reconstruction efforts in
Afghanistan.
Foreign Secretary led the Indian delegation
to the International Conference on
Afghanistan in Berlin from 31 March -1
April 2004. The objective of the conference,
which was attended by representatives of the
Afghan government, the UN and major
donors and institutions, was to secure
substantial long-term aid commitments.
India made a commitment of US$ 400
million over 2002-2008, which has shown
India as a long-term partner in Afghanistans
reconstruction effort.
The developments in Afghanistan since the
Bonn Agreement of 5 December 2001 can
be assessed positively. As part of this process
the Constitutional Loya Jirga was held in

December 2003. Despite this progress,
however, the Afghan Government faces
many challenges ahead and the foremost
being the threat to internal security including
from regrouped Taliban. The increasing
terrorist attacks by remnants of Taliban and
Al Qaeda elements are aimed at
undermining the authority of the central
government as well as slowing the pace of
reconstruction, especially in the provinces of
south, southeast and east of Afghanistan.
There is growing concern at the external
support that the Taliban remnants continue
to receive and the threat this poses to stability.

Bangladesh
Ties with Bangladesh were strengthened
through efforts by both sides to reactivate
institutional mechanisms existing for
cooperation in diverse areas of bilateral
relations. The Joint Economic Commission
(JEC), headed by the respective Foreign
Ministers, met after six years in Dhaka from
14-15 July 2003. The meeting provided the
opportunity for giving a high level thrust to
economic ties while reviewing in a
comprehensive manner the entire gamut of
economic issues. Discussions were earlier
held during the visit of the Bangladesh
Minister of Finance, Mr. Saifur Rahman to
India from 19-22 May 2003. Foreign Office
Consultations were held from 29- 30 March
2003 after a gap of more than three years.
The Ministerial Level Joint Rivers
Commission (JRC) was also held on 28 -29
September 2003, after a gap of nearly three
years.
During the 6 th meeting of the JEC,
discussions were held on a possible new line
of credit that could be denominated in US
dollars. This would succeed the existing line
of credit of Rs. 200 crores that is nearly fully
utilised. Railways is an emerging sector of
bilateral cooperation and proposals in the
pipeline include the introduction of
containerised services by rail and the
Sealdah-Joydevpur passenger rail link.
Cooperation in new areas such as Science
and Technology, IT and Agriculture are also
being discussed between the two sides. India
has offered assistance to Bangladesh for a
project on training of school- teachers in IT

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

and a project on disaster warning in the Bay
of Bengal.
Pursuant to a decision taken at the 6th JEC
meeting and in a significant step towards
promoting greater people to people contact
between the two countries, a bus service was
inaugurated between Agartala and Dhaka
on 19 September 2003. The Minister of
Road Transport and Highways Maj. Gen.
B.C. Khanduri, the Bangladesh Minister of
Communications Mr. Nazmul Huda and the
Chief Minister of Tripura Shri Manik
Sarkar jointly inaugurated the bus service in
both Agartala and Dhaka.
The Agartala-Dhaka link follows the
hugely successful existing bus service
between Kolkata and Dhaka. The new
bus service is expected to become
increasingly popular, particularly after
certain problems relating to issue of
visas and imposition of travel tax are
resolved between the two sides.

Another significant development in bilateral
ties was the commencement of negotiations
on the signing a bilateral Free Trade
Agreement (FTA). These negotiations were
conducted between the Commerce
Ministries of the two countries from 20-22
October 2003. Both sides reviewed the
successful progress of the Indo-Sri Lanka
Free Trade Agreement, which stands as a
symbol of successful cooperation in trade
liberalisation despite asymmetries in
economic size and strength. The terms and
conditions of an FTA are expected to be even
more liberal given the LDC status of
Bangladesh.
A mechanism for structured dialogue on the
issue of non-tariff barriers was also created
and a first meeting was held between the two
Bangladeshi exporters and facilitate
Bangladeshs exports to India. In turn
complaints raised by Indian exporters would
be also officially raised in this forum.
The Joint Rivers Commission meeting
provided an opportunity for both the sides
to review bilateral cooperation in the water
sector. A significant development in recent
years has been the expansion of cooperation
"

in this sector to areas beyond water sharing
to include areas such as flood forecasting,
arsenic mitigation and disaster warning. The
implementation of the working of the
Ganges Water Treaty, 1996 was also
reviewed. The Bangladesh side also
expressed concern over the proposed river
inter-linking project in India. However, it
was conveyed that the project was only at a
conceptual stage.
Institutional dialogue on key issues relating
to border management continued through
the biannual DG level talks between the
Border Security Force (BSF) and the
Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) that were
concluded in April 2003. Simultaneous
coordinated patrolling was discussed
between the two sides in an effort to jointly
tackle border crimes. The two forces are also
discussing confidence-building measures to
improve understanding between the forces
such as offer of training in Indian institutions
and sports exchanges.
Cultural and educational exchanges
continued to grow between the two countries
and an increasing number of students from
Bangladesh are choosing India to pursue
their higher studies.

Bhutan
Bhutan is one of Indias closest neighbours
with which it shares mutually beneficial
relations in a wide range of fields. Indian
Rupee is legal tender in Bhutan and India
accounts for over 90% of Bhutans global
trade. People and goods move freely across
the open border of 700 kms. The special
relationship is sustained by the exchange of
regular visits including at the highest level
between the two countries.
Crown Prince of Bhutan, Dasho Jigme
Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, visited India
at the invitation of the Vice President, from
28 August-1 September 2003. During the
visit, a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) was signed between the Government
of India and the Royal Government of
Bhutan for establishing an India-Bhutan
Foundation with a joint corpus of funds. The
objective of India-Bhutan Foundation is to
enhance people to people interactions to
further mutual interests.

King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of the
Kingdom of Bhutan paid a State visit to
India from 14-18 September 2003. During
the visit, the President and Vice-President
held talks with the King. The Prime Minister,
Deputy Prime Minister, External Affairs
Minister and Minister of Finance held
discussions separately. On the eve of the visit,
Gover nment of India conveyed its
commitment on a number of projects and
programmes under Indian assistance to
Bhutans 9th Five Year Plan  2002-2007. An
MoU for the preparation of a Detailed
Project Report on the 900 MW
Punatsangchu Hydroelectric Power Project
was also signed during the visit. There was
an exchange of views on a wide range of
issues of mutual interest and concern,
including the presence of Indian Insurgent
Groups (IIGs) in Bhutan, and the various
measures on the part of the Royal
Government of Bhutan to persuade them
to leave Bhutan. Both sides agreed to
continue working closely with a view to
resolving the issue. The two governments
reiterated that as close friends and allies they
would not allow their territories to be used
by anyone for carrying out activities that are
harmful to each others national interests.
Some long pending issues relating to the
Indo-Bhutan boundary were resolved at a
bilateral meeting concluded on 24 February
2004 in Thimphu.
Military Operation in Bhutan by
Royal Bhutan Army
The Governments of India and Bhutan had
been concerned about the presence of
Indian Insurgent Groups (IIGs) located in
the thickly forested border area of South
Eastern Bhutan and had been in close
consultation with each other on the issue.
Cadres of three Indian IIGs: United
Liberation Front in Assam (ULFA), National
Democratic Front for Bodoland (NDFB) and
the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation
(KLO) had established about 30 camps in
this area from where they would enter India,
carry out attacks on the Indian side and
retreat beyond the reach of the Indian
security forces into these camps in the
Bhutanese jungles.

India’s Neighbours

At India’s request, the Royal
Government of Bhutan decided to
tackle the problem and expel the IIGs
from Bhutanese territory. When their
attempts to peacefully achieve this
objective failed, the Royal Bhutan
Army launched a military operation of
precision attacks on all the 30 camps
on 15 December 2003. In about three
weeks, the Royal Bhutanese Army
was able to destroy all the 30 camps
and observation posts of the IIGs and
render
their
communication
equipment inoperative.

The Government of India stood firmly
behind the Royal Government of Bhutan,
providing all logistical support requested by
the latter till the completion of the operation.
The military action of the Royal Bhutan
Army against the insurgents has not only
helped the Indian security forces to tackle
the IIGs effectively on the Indian side, (as
of now, the KLO has been all but decimated
and the ULFA and NDFB severely
weakened), but has also immeasurably
strengthened the friendly relations between
the India and Bhutan.
Government of India and Royal
Government of Bhutan have held detailed
discussions in March 2004 to address, in a
comprehensive manner, mutual security
concer ns in the wake of the military
operations carried out by Royal Government
of Bhutan against Indian Insurgents Groups
operating from Bhutan.
As part of the close bilateral cooperation,
India continues to be the major contributor
to Bhutans five-years plans, the first of
which commenced in 1961. In consultation
with the Royal Government of Bhutan,
Government of India arrived at a mutually
agreed slate of projects and programmes to
be financed by India in the 9th Five Year Plan
of India (2002-2007) in various mutually
beneficial sectors including power,
infrastructure, roads and bridges etc. There
is increased emphasis in our assistance on
the social sector in areas such as Education,
Health, Communications, IT etc. in keeping
with the larger vision of bilateral relations.

The 1020 MW Tala Hydroelectric Project
under GOI assistance to Bhutan is
progressing apace and is expected to come
on stream in 2005/06. Almost the entire
production of power from this plant will be
exported to India. Two bilateral meetings
have been held in January and March 2004
to arrive at a common principle for fixing
the tariff for power to be imported by India
from Tala Hydro-Electric Project in Bhutan.
The Cellular Mobile Phone Network in
Bhutan was inaugurated on November 11
2003. The project was executed by M/S
Telecommunication Consultants India Ltd.,
Government of India Undertaking, on a
turnkey basis through a contract awarded by
Bhutan Telecom Unit. Government of India
financed part of the cost of the project
relating to equipment, installation and
training amounting to Rs.11.7 crores.
There is close bilateral cooperation between
the two countries in the fields of education
and culture. India provides technical
expertise and services of specialists to Bhutan
in various fields. Government of Indias
(GOI) scholarships are granted to 50
Bhutanese students every year in Indian
Institutions of higher learning. These GOI
scholarships are in addition to facilities
extended under the ITEC/TCS of Colombo
Plan schemes. A large number of Bhutanese
students study in Indian schools and colleges
on self-financing. Bhutans Sherubtse College
is affiliated to Delhi University. 13 Indiabased lecturers are working in this college
under the TCS of Colombo Plan. The King
of Bhutan has endowed a chair for Buddhist
studies in the Nagarjuna University in
Andhra Pradesh. Cooperation between
cultural institutions of both countries,
especially museums, is growing. To continue
and sustain the momentum Exhibitions
titled, The Living Religious and Cultural
Traditions of Bhutan were organized by
Bhutan in New Delhi and Kolkata in 2001.
A Festival of India was organised in Bhutan
from June to November 2003 with the theme
Eternal Friendship and Cooperation. The
Festival was inaugurated in June 2003 by the
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri
Vinod Khanna and concluded in November
2003 by Minister of State for Culture.

China
Indias interaction with China, which is
based on the principles of Panchsheel,
mutual sensitivity to each others concerns
and equality, has developed due to the
mutual agreement to qualitatively enhance
the bilateral relationship at different levels
while simultaneously addressing each others
differences through direct dialogue and
peaceful means in a fair, reasonable and
mutually acceptable manner.
Indias commitment to build a broad-based
and cooperative relationship with China was
further emphasised in 2003-04. Prime
Ministers visit to China from 22-27 June
2003, which took place after a gap of ten
years, was a major step forward in the
ongoing process of building mutual trust and
understanding between India and China.
Apart from Prime Minister, both the Speaker
and Raksha Mantri visited China this year.
President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao
accepted invitation to visit India with
appreciation. In addition to visits at the
highest political levels, a Dialogue on Policy
Planning and annual interaction at the
Foreign Minister level were added this year.
2003-04 has also shown a steady
improvement in bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.
Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari
Vajpayee’s Visit
Prime Minister’s visit gave a new
impetus to India’s developing and
diversifying relations with China.
Prime Minister was able to establish
a useful rappor t with the new
leadership in China. The first-ever
signed Joint Declaration issued by the
two Prime Ministers of India and China
not only lays down a roadmap to build
a “qualitatively new relationship” and
develop a “long-term constructive and
cooperative partnership” but also
reflects the political will of the two
Governments to move towards those
objectives. Both India and China
agreed that multi-polarity in today’s
world should be strengthened. Both
sides recognised the threat posed by
terrorism to them and to global peace

#

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

and security and resolutely
condemned terrorism in all forms. India
is looking forward to greater
engagement with China in diverse
areas and a further improvement of
India-China relations on the basis of
the principles of Panchsheel, mutual
sensitivity to each other’s concerns
and equality.

The Prime Minister visited China at the
invitation of Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the
State Council of the Peoples Republic of
China. His visit took place almost ten years
after the last Prime Ministerial visit to China
in September 1993. This visit has proved to
be a crucial link in the chain of high-level
visits forged over the past few years in the
ongoing process of building mutual trust and
understanding between India and China.
Prime Ministers visit to China imparted a
fresh momentum to the ongoing
development and diversification of
cooperation between India and China. He
had the opportunity of personally interacting
with the new Chinese leadership, meeting
with Premier Wen Jiabao, President Hu
Jintao, NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo, Vice
President Zeng Qinghong and CMC
Chairman Jiang Zemin. He was received
with great warmth and courtesy and was
clearly given to understand that Indias desire
to expand the bilateral relationship and build
mutual trust and confidence was
reciprocated. Another theme emphasised by
the Chinese side during Prime Ministers visit
was that the current global situation requires
India and China to work together.
Both these themes were reflected in the Joint
Declaration on Principles for Relations and
Comprehensive Cooperation between India
and China that was signed by both Prime
Ministers in Beijing. This is a significant
document, which outlines the concepts
underpinning the bilateral relationship
between India and China and the lines along
which this relationship will progress in the
future. It further states that progress in
bilateral relations between India and China
is conducive also to regional stability and
prosperity and that cooperation between our
two countries will strengthen multipolarity
$

at the international level. It also signals to
Asia and the world that the two countries
are committed to working more closely
together both in the region and globally.
The Joint Declaration also contains a
reiteration of India’s position on Tibet.
Regarding Tibet, it must be stressed
that contrary to some media reports,
there is no change in India’s position
either on Tibet or on the presence of
His Holiness the Dalai Lama or other
Tibetan refugees in India, and that
nothing new has been agreed to or
said. Another important outcome of
the visit is the decision to appoint
Special Representatives to explore
from the political perspective of the
overall bilateral relationship the
framework of a boundary settlement.
This step was taken at Prime
Minister’s initiative. The National
Security Advisor, Shri Brajesh Mishra
was appointed as Prime Minister’s
Special Representative. China has
appointed their senior-most Vice
Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo as his
counter par t. Mr. Dai was earlier
Minister in charge of the International
Liaison Department of the Communist
Party of China and is currently a
member of the Central Committee of
the Party. The work of the two Special
Representatives will be in addition to
the ongoing implementation of the
1993 and 1996 agreements between
India and China on the process of
clarification of the Line of Actual
Control and on the continued
maintenance of peace and tranquility
in the border areas. Two rounds of
cordial, constructive and cooperative
discussions between the Special
Representatives have taken place so
far on 23-24 October 2003 and 12-13
January 2004.

The framework of a structured interaction
between India and China was also expanded
during Prime Ministers visit with the
decision to hold annual meetings at the
Foreign Minister level. The nine agreements
signed during the visit include an MoU

laying down liberalised procedures for issue
of visas to ordinary passport holders; an
MoU on cooperation in the field of justice;
the first bilateral Executive Programme on
Educational Cooperation and Exchange for
the period 2003 to 2006, replacing the
framework for education-related exchanges,
including mutual scholarships, which earlier
used to form part of the CEP; the Executive
Programme of Cultural Exchanges India
and China for the years 2003-2005; the
Protocol of Phytosanitary Requirements for
Exporting Mangoes from India to China;
and an MoU for Enhanced Cooperation in
the field of Renewable Energy. In addition,
three MoUs were signed relating to the field
of science & technology, envisaging greater
cooperation and collaborative activities in
identified areas in basic and applied sciences,
and including one MoU relating to the
promotion of development and cooperation
in ocean science and technology.
In addition to the above, Pr ime
Minister’s visit also saw the signing of
an MoU on expanding border trade
through Nathu La pass on the India
China boundary. This adds a third
border crossing point to those
currently operational, under the 1991
border trade agreement which allowed
trade through Lipulekh pass in what
is today Uttaranchal, and the 1993
agreement on trade through Shipki La
pass in Himachal Pradesh. This MoU
has also started the process by which
Sikkim will cease to be an issue in
India-China relations.

The strengthening of economic and trade
relations between India and China was also
an important theme of the Prime Ministers
visit. Apart from External Affairs Minister,
the Prime Minister was accompanied by
Commerce and Industry Minister while the
Minister for Communication, Information
Technology and Disinvestment joined him
in Shanghai. Prime Minister delivered
keynote addresses at two very large
gatherings of Indian and Chinese
businessmen at both Beijing and Shanghai,
while the Economic Ministers had separate
interactive sessions with relevant agencies

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

and with Chinese businessmen. In addition,
a 70-member delegation of senior
businessmen from CII, FICCI and
ASSOCHAM was in attendance, signaling
that Indian business and industry is very
much aware of the potential of our
economic relationship, an awareness, which
was clearly reciprocated by the Chinese side.
One decision taken during the visit, which
will directly impact on the expansion of
Indias economic cooperation with China,
is the decision to set up a Joint Study Group
(JSG) to report, within the next twelve
months, on the potential complementarities
in expanded trade and economic
cooperation between India and China. The
JSG will also identify areas of meaningful
economic potential and recommend
concrete measures to be taken over the next
five years by both the governments to
facilitate increase in bilateral trade, promote
investments and encourage greater
cooperation between the business
communities of both countries. It was also
decided that a joint financial dialogue and
cooperation mechanism would be set up to
strengthen coordination in this sector. The
7th meeting of the Joint Economic Group
between India and China is to be convened
at the earliest possible.
In the Joint Declaration, dairy, food
processing and health were specifically
identified as possible sectors for future
cooperation, while both sides agreed that
they would continue to work towards the
enhancement of direct air/ shipping links
and tourism, exchange of hydrological data
in flood season on common rivers, and
cooperation in agriculture and other sectors.
Due attention was also given to the cultural
facet of our bilateral relationship during
Prime Ministers visit. Apart from the
agreement to establish cultural centres in
Delhi and Beijing, Prime Minister
inaugurated the Centre for Indian Studies
in Beijing University, which aims to promote
further India-related studies and research
among Chinese scholars. The Prime
Minister also announced some important
contributions to facilitate the functioning of
this Centre, including financial grants,
&

scholarships, and awards for meritorious
students and gifting of books and equipment
to receive Indian satellite channels. It was
also agreed to jointly celebrate the 50th
Anniversary of the Panchsheel next year.
Prime Minister had the opportunity of
visiting the White Horse Temple in Luoyang
where the first Buddhist monks came from
India to China. Luoyang and the Longmen
Grottoes represent the cultural and historical
dimension of our bilateral interaction. He
also laid the foundation stone of the
Embassys new Chancery project in Beijing.
Apart from his visit to China, the Prime
Minister met President Hu Jintao during the
300 th anniversary celebrations of St.
Petersburg in May. He also met Premier Wen
Jiabao on the margins of the ASEAN
Summit in Bali in October. Messages have
also been exchanged between the Prime
Minister and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao,
including a message sent by the Prime
Minister after the success of Chinas first
manned space mission in October, and a
message from Premier Wen on the occasion
of the first meeting of the Special
Representatives.
Raksha Mantri, George Fernandes paid an
important visit to China from 20  27 April
2003. He met Defence Minister, Cao
Gangchuan, Premier Wen Jiabao and CMC
Chairman, Jiang Zemin. Besides Beijing,
Raksha Mantri visited Xian and Shanghai.
Following Raksha Mantris and Prime
Ministers visit, both countries have agreed
to intensify, and raise to a new level, bilateral
defence exchanges and cooperation. This
year, three Chinese delegations, one from the
PLA Air Force Command College (July
2003), one from the Nanjing Army
Command College (August 2003) and a
delegation led by General Wu Quanxu,
Deputy Chief of General Staff of the PLA
(December 2003) visited India. Three Indian
Navy ships paid a goodwill visit to Shanghai
from 10-14 November 2003. On 14
November they conducted, for the first time,
joint search and rescue exercises with the
PLA Navy. GOC 4 Corps, Lt. Gen.
Mohinder Singh visited China, including
Chengdu and Tibet, from 17 -22 November,
2003, while an Inter Services delegation led

by Air Marshal GCS Rajwar, Deputy Chief
of Integrated Defence Staff and Chairman,
Joint Training Committee, visited China
from 14 - 21 December 2003.
Speaker of the Lok Sabha Shri Manohar
Joshi led a 12-member Indian Parliamentary
delegation on an official visit to China from
5-10 January 2003. The Speaker met
President Jiang Zemin, National Peoples
Congress Chairman Li Peng, and Premier
of the State Council Zhu Rongji. He visited
Beijing and Shanghai. During the
discussions, both sides recognised the
contribution of regular high-level exchanges,
including Parliamentary exchanges, in
developing the relationship and expressed
satisfaction with the steady improvement in
bilateral relations.
The External Affairs Minister accompanied
the Prime Minister on his visit to China in
June 2003. He interacted with his Chinese
counterpart on the margins of ARF in
Phnom Penh on June 19. He also hosted an
informal luncheon for the Foreign Ministers
of China and Russia on the margins of
UNGA in New York on 23 September 2003,

Chinese nationals and others have been
rising in tandem with the greater

opening up of the Indian tourism sector for
Chinese tourists, the number of tourist visas
issued is also increasing gradually. The MoU
on visa services signed during Prime

September 2003. This has eased and
facilitated issue of visas, including multiple
entry visas to businesspersons, tourists,
students and those attending conferences.
The SARS epidemic in China adversely
affected travel from April to June 2003.
Despite this, a total of 12,330 visas were
issued by Beijing and Shanghai during the
10-month period from April 2003 to January
2004 as against 10,330 visas issued in the
calendar year 2002.
The SARS epidemic in China also delayed
the start of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,
as a result of which the total number of
Yatris who made the pilgrimage was reduced
to 316. The Chinese side has agreed to
consider Prime Ministers request, made
during his visit in June, for opening of
additional routes for the Kailash Mansarovar
Yatra.

Myanmar
Our policy of engagement with Myanmar
was strengthened during the year as high
level exchanges intensified. The Vice
President of India, Shri Bhairon Singh
Shekhawat paid a State visit to Myanmar
from 2-5 November 2003 marking the first
VVIP visit from India to Myanmar since the

Nepal
India and Nepal enjoy close relations
reflecting the historical, geographical,
cultural and linguistic links between our two
countries and an open border stretching over
1860 kms across which people and goods
move freely. Indian Rupee is a legal tender
in Nepal. Over 60% of Nepals global trade
is India-centric and nearly half of the
Foreign Direct Investment in the country
originates from India. Inevitably, events in
one country influence the other in many
ways and India naturally attaches high
priority to strengthening the ongoing
bilateral co-operation with Nepal for the
mutual benefit of our peoples.
In keeping with Indias close relationship,
several high-level interactions took place
between the two countries during the year,
which provided opportunities to review the
bilateral relations and contributed to the
consolidation of bilateral relations. Nepalese
Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa paid
a working visit to India in his capacity as the
Head of Government of the outgoing
SAARC Chairman country, Nepal. Minister
for Communication and Infor mation
Technology, Shri Arun Shourie visited Nepal
from 10-11 September 2003 to inaugurate
WLL telephone service, a Joint Venture
between Mahanagar Telecommunications
Nigam Ltd, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd,
Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd
and Nepal Ventures Private Ltd (NVPL).
Nepalese Minister for Information and
Communication, and Health Mr. Kamal

Thapa had occasion to meet with Indian
leaders in New Delhi during the South East
Asian Regional Conference of WHO from
7-9 September 2003 and again in November
2003 at the SAARC Health Ministers
Conference. Foreign Secretary visited Nepal
during 9-11 July to participate in SAARC
Standing Committee Meeting. At the
working level, there were regular interactions
between the officials of Ministries of
External Affairs, Home Affairs, Commerce,
Water Resources, Finance etc. with a view

Management. A comprehensive review of
issues relating to security cooperation
between India and Nepal was undertaken
in the meetings.
Foreign Secretary Shri Shashank visited
Nepal from 22-25 February 2004. During
the visit, he called on King Gyanendra Bir
Bikram Shah Dev, Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa and Dr. Bhekh Bahadur
Thapa, Ambassador at Large, and held
extensive bilateral discussions with the
Nepalese Foreign Secretary. He also had
interaction with a cross-section of the
Nepalese polity.
Substantial progress was achieved on a
number of bilateral issues. Discussions were
initiated on the 300 MW Upper Karnali
Hydro-electric project to be taken up by
India on Build Own Operate Transfer
(BOOT) basis and for preparation of a
Detailed Project Report (DPR) for 600 MW
Budhi Gandaki Hydro-electric project in
Nepal. The two Governments have agreed
to set up a Joint Project Office for the Sapt

Kosi Multipurpose Project to carry out field
investigations to update data for the
preparation of a DPR for the project. A
Master Plan on Flood Forecasting and
Warning System has been completed and
would be taken up for implementation. Rail
Services Agreement to operationalize the
Inland Container Depot at Birgunj in Nepal
was initialed. Progress has been made
towards conclusion of Motor Vehicles
Agreement, Extradition Treaty, Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaty and Investment
Promotion and Protection Agreement
between the two countries. A Bilateral
Consultative Group on Security Issues has
been set up with a view to strengthen the
ongoing security related cooperation.
Maoist Insurgency in Nepal
The security situation in Nepal continues to
be a cause of concern. The year 2003 began
on a positive note when a ceasefire was
announced between Maoists and
Government of Nepal on 29 January.
Subsequently, three rounds of talks were held
between the Government and the Maoists
on 27 April, 9 May, and 17August 2003
respectively. The talks ultimately broke down
because of disagreement on the issue of
elections to the Constituent Assembly and
Maoists withdrew from the ceasefire on 27
August 2003. Since then, Maoist violence
has continued unabated and is now
threatening areas in the Terai. Meanwhile,
political parties continue to agitate against
the regressive measures since 4 October
2002 and have refused to join the
Government.
India’s consistent position remains
that a national consensus needs to be
evolved based on the principles of
multipar ty
democracy
and
constitutional monarchy to effectively
address the challenges posed by the
Maoist
insurgency.
Only
a
representative government, with the
participation of all parliamentary
parties, working in close cooperation
with the monarchy, could help in
evolving a sustainable solution to the
conflict. India has strongly condemned

%

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

the recourse to violence by Maoists
and continues to support all efforts of
Gover nment of Nepal to restore
normalcy and order in the country.

Indian Para military forces have been
deployed at sensitive areas of the India Nepal border to keep a close vigil along the
border to prevent miscreants from misusing
the open border between the two countries.
Government of India provides a generous
aid package to Nepal with an average annual
budget of Rs.60 crores to Rs.75 crores. A
number of projects in areas relating to
infrastructure, health, water resources, rural
and community development, education,
etc. are currently underway. During the year,
work on a major aid-project involving laying
of optical fibre cable network along the EastWest Highway was commenced which would
greatly improve telecommunication facility
within Nepal and between India and Nepal.
Another project has been formulated on the
development of border infrastructure, which
will facilitate Nepals trade and transit and
improve the security along the border.
Cultural linkages between India and Nepal
are supplemented by over 100 scholarships
to Nepalese students offered annually.
Another 50-60 distance education
scholarships are provided to Nepalese
students at the Indira Gandhi National Open
University. Training programmes are offered
to employees of Government of Nepal in
various institutions under Indian Technical
and Economic Training Programme (ITEC)
and under the Colombo Plan. 50
scholarships are awarded to meritorious
Nepalese students for undergraduate courses
in Nepal. During the year, a new scheme,
the Mahatma Gandhi Scholarship Scheme,
was introduced under which 500
scholarships would be awarded to
meritorious Nepalese students every year for
class XI-XII in Nepal.

Pakistan
India has always desired peaceful, friendly
and cooperative relations with Pakistan as
envisaged in the Simla Agreement. All the
policy initiatives taken by India, including,
&

over the past few years, the Composite
Dialogue in 1998, Prime Ministers visit to
Lahore in 1999, and the invitation extended
to President General Pervez Musharraf for
summit level talks at Agra in July 2001, were
underpinned by this objective.
Government have been making continued
efforts to build upon the possibilities that
exist and to catalyze the desire of people on
both sides to have peaceful and friendly
relations. At the same time, mindful of the
fact that careful preparation is necessary so
that there is a meaningful engagement at the
higher levels, government have, since April
last year, adopted a step-by-step approach
to normalize relations with Pakistan.
Prime Minister’s Initiative: 18 April
2003
In keeping with this spirit, Prime Minister
Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, at a public rally
in Srinagar on 18 April 2003, had once again
extended the hand of friendship to Pakistan.
Following this gesture, he received a
telephone call from Prime Minister Mir
Zafarullah Khan Jamali of Pakistan on 28
April 2003. The two Prime Ministers
discussed ways of moving bilateral relations
forward. In this context, Prime Minister
Vajpayee suggested the importance of
economic cooperation, cultural exchanges
and people-to-people contacts, as progress
on these issues could help create a climate
conducive to addressing more difficult issues.
During the call, the importance of early
resumption of civil aviation and
implementation of decisions on trade and
economic cooperation taken at the SAARC
Kathmandu Summit was also emphasised
Prime Minister Vajpayee had, in his
suo-moto statement in Parliament on
2 May 2003, stated, “ we are
committed to the improvement of
relations with Pakistan, and are willing
to grasp every opportunity for doing
so. However, we have repeatedly
expressed the need to create a
conducive atmosphere for a sustained
dialogue, which necessarily requires
an end to cross border terrorism and
the dismantling of its infrastructure”.

Several significant subsequent steps
includedn restoration of relations at the level of

High Commissioners;

n resumption of the Delhi-Lahore bus

service;

n high level exchanges at the level of

Parliamentarians, businessmen, media,
artists, writers, judges, peace activists,
sporting contacts, and others;

n free medical treatment to 20 Pakistani

children;

n release of prisoners and fishermen on

both sides;

n increase in the strength of the respective

High Commissions.

These generated a positive resonance
amongst the people in the two countries.
Indian proposals to Pakistan: 22
October 2003
On 22 October 2003, India announced
further steps to promote people to people
contact between the two countries. The
proposals includedn resumption of civil aviation links to be

followed by resumption of the rail link;

n resumption of

bilateral sporting
encounters including cricket;

n permission to senior citizens (65 years

and above) to cross at Wagah on foot;

n holding of visa camps in different cities

to benefit the people;

n increasing the capacity of the Delhi-

Lahore-Delhi bus service by running
more buses;

n the establishment of links between the

Coast Guards authorities of the two
countries;

n the non-arrest by either side of fishermen

of the other country within a certain
band on the sea;

n provision of free medical treatment to a

second lot of 20 Pakistani children;

n resumption of passenger shipping

services between Mumbai and Karachi;

n commencement of a bus service between

Srinagar and Muzaffarabad;

n starting a bus or rail link between

Munabao in Rajasthan (India) and
Khokrapar in Sind (Pakistan) ; and

n further increase in size of the respective

High Commissions.

Pakistans initial response on 29 October
2003 was inadequate. While welcoming
some of the proposals, like allowing senior
citizens to cross Wagah on foot, establishing
links between Indian Coast Gaurds and
Pakistan Maritime Security Agency, and
resumption of bilateral sporting contacts,
they opted to politicise the humanitarian
gestures and attached impractical,
extraneous and delaying conditions to
others.
However, on 23 November 2003, the Prime
Minister of Pakistan Mir Zafarullah Khan
Jamali responded positively to the
communication links proposed by India on
22nd October. He, inter alia, stated that
Pakistan was ready to open discussions on
Indian proposals regarding opening
Khokrapar - Munabao route, ferry service
between Karachi and Mumbai, establishing
bus link between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar
and communication links between the two
coast guards. India welcomed the Pakistani
response and proposed immediate technical
level talks for early implementation of these
proposals.
Ceasefire along the International
Border, LOC and AGPL in J&K
Prime Minister of Pakistan, on 23 November
2003, also announced that Pakistan armed
forces along the LOC had been issued
instructions to ceasefire along the LOC with
effect from Eid-al-Fitr. India welcomed the
Pakistani decision, but also made it clear that
in order to establish a full ceasefire on a
durable basis, there must be an end to
infiltration from across the Line of Control
(LOC). To take this process (of ceasefire)
further, India also proposed a ceasefire along
the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) in
Siachen. The matter was discussed during
the conversation between the Director
General Military Operations of the two
!

countries on 25 November 2003, and it was
agreed to observe a ceasefire on the
International Border, LOC and AGPL with
effect from the midnight of November 25,
2003.
Restoration of Communication links
After the resumption of the Delhi-Lahore
Bus service, steps were initiated to restore
civil aviation and rails links between the two
countries. Consequently, during the second
round of Civil Aviation talks, held in New
Delhi on 1 December 2003, India and
Pakistan agreed to resume simultaneous
point-to-point services and over-flights with
effect from 1 January 2004 on a reciprocal
basis. Further, during technical level
discussions between the railway authorities
of the two countries held on 18-19
December 2003 in New Delhi, it was decided
to resume Samjahuta Express and freight
train services with effect from 15 January
2004.
Prime Minister’s visit to Islamabad:
4-6 January 2004
The above process was taken significantly
forward through Prime Ministers visit to
Islamabad (January 4-6, 2004) for the
SAARC Summit. On the sidelines of the
Summit, Prime Minister Vajpayee had
meetings with Pakistan Prime Minister
Jamali and President Musharraf. Besides,
External Affairs Minister and Foreign
Secretary also made courtesy calls on their
counterparts. These meetings had a positive
impact.
A Joint Press Statement was also issued after
Prime Minister Vajpayees meeting with
President Musharraf. Both leaders welcomed
the recent steps towards normalisation of
relations between the two countries and
expressed the hope that the positive trends
set by the CBMs would be consolidated.
Prime Minister Vajpayee said that in order
to take forward and sustain the dialogue
process, violence, hostility and terrorism
must be prevented. President Musharraf
reassured Prime Minister Vajpayee that he
would not permit any territory under
Pakistans control to be used to support
terrorism in any manner. To carry the

process of normalisation forward, the two
leaders agreed to commence the process of
the Composite Dialogue in February 2004.
Joint Secretary and Foreign
Secretary level meetings: 16-18
February 2004
Subsequently, the Foreign Secretaries of
Pakistan and India met in Islamabad on
February 18, 2004. They reviewed and
endorsed the agreement worked out at the
Joint Secretary/ Director General level
meetings on 16-17 February 2004 on the
modalities and timeframe for discussions on
all subjects on the agenda of the Composite
Dialogue.
The following schedule of meetings was
agreed to in the Joint Press Statement issued
after the Foreign Secretaries level meeting

countries.
Status of cross border terrorism
A ceasefire along the International Border,
Line of Control, and the Actual Ground
Position Line in Jammu and Kashmir, which
is being observed since November 25, 2003
has continued to hold. Though there has
been some decline in cross border
infiltration, Pakistan is yet to take credible
steps to dismantle the infrastructure of
support to terrorism.
Government favour the resolution of all
differences with Pakistan through bilateral
dialogue in accordance with the Simla
Agreement. Government would continue to
carry forward the present process in IndiaPakistan relations. However, the
sustainability of the process necessarily
requires Pakistan to fulfill its assurances to
not permit any territory under its control to
be used to support terrorism in any manner.

Sri Lanka
India-Sri Lanka relations consolidated
further in 2003-2004. Apart from the large
number of high-level political exchanges,
there was much progress on the economic
front with bilateral trade crossing the US$ 1
billion mark. Following the signing of a
Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE in
February 2002, Sri Lanka, facilitator Norway
and Japan have been keeping India regularly
briefed on developments in the peace
process.

Sri Lankan Peace Process
The end of years of ethnic violence in Sri
Lanka with the signing of the Ceasefire
Agreement between the Sri Lankan
Government (SLG) and Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) enabled a
reinvigorating of India-Sri Lanka bilateral
relations, especially on the economic front.
Progress in the Sri Lankan peace process was
far from smooth. Despite six rounds of talks
the LTTE showed no inclination to
decommission its arms. Thereafter, it
suspended participation in the peace talks
and announced that it would not participate
in the Tokyo Donors Conference in June
2003 citing its exclusion from the Aid-to-Sri
Lanka Seminar in Washington in April and
its dissatisfaction with the slow progress, on
the ground, in the administration of aid in
the North and East. The LTTE also rejected
the first two proposals offered by the SLG
for Interim Administrative structure in the
North-East. In July 2003, the Sri Lankan
Prime Minister offered a third set of revised
proposals for an Interim Administration for
the North and the East consisting of a threetier mechanism, the Provisional
Administrative Council that would be made
up of members nominated by the SLG,
including nominees of Peoples Alliance
which includes Sri Lankan Presidents party
(Sri Lanka Freedom Party - SLFP), the Sri
Lankan Muslim Congress and the LTTE,
with a large degree of devolution of powers
to regional administration except in areas of
police, security, land and revenue.
At the Tokyo Donors Conference where
US$ 4.5 billion was pledged over three years
for the reconstruction of the Sri Lankan
economy, India was represented at the level
of Deputy Chief of Mission, Embassy of
India in Tokyo and made no pledge since
India has a large bilateral assistance
programme. LTTEs absence was strongly
criticised by all. The Tokyo Declaration
called for a simultaneous decommissioning
of its arms with the shrinking of High
Security Zones manned by the Sri Lankan
Army and linked disbursement of aid to
progress in peace talks.
The LTTE made counterproposals to the
SLGs proposals on 31 October 2003. The

India’s Neighbours

counterproposals were of a secessionist
nature with LTTE arrogating to the Interim
self-Governing Authority (ISGA) for the
North and the East, many of the attributes
of sovereignty by keeping key subjects such
as the signing of international treaties,
external trade, resolution of disputes, control
of maritime boundaries, under its control.
There was no role for institutions of the
SLG. Within the ISGA, the LTTE arranged
for absolute majority and absolute power for
governance. It proposed a separate Financial
Commission, and full control of finances by
the ISGA.
The counterproposals put pressure on the
already delicate relationship between the
President and Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
The President had all along expressed
concern at the continuing consolidation of
the LTTE on the ground, arms-smuggling
and child recruitment and the manner in
which the negotiations were being conducted
by the SLG. She was especially concerned
that the security threats to Sri Lanka were
not being addressed sufficiently. Based on a
judgement of the Sri Lankan Supreme
Court, that the plenary powers relating the
defence of Sri Lanka including the powers
to make regulations under Army, Navy and
Air Force Act were reposed in the President,
she took over the portfolios of Defence,
Interior and Mass Communications from the
SLG citing reasons of danger to national
security due to ineffective steps taken by the
Sri Lankan Administration. She assured
the nation that the Ceasefire Agreement with
the LTTE would not be disrupted and
expressed her willingness to hold discussions
with the LTTE for a balanced solution
within the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister was in USA on an
official visit at that time. The Sri Lankan
President prorogued Parliament until 19
November 2003 when it reconvened to
enable the Government to present its budget
proposals.
Norway temporarily suspended its
facilitation activities citing the domestic
political developments in Sri Lanka. The
President and the Prime Minister have met
several times since, and appointed a
Committee of Officials to work out

consensual approach for smooth governance
and negotiations with the LTTE.
India expressed surprise at the sudden
political developments of 4 November 2003
in Sri Lanka and stated that the situation
should not provoke a crisis impacting on the
political stability and ongoing peace process.
President Chandrika Bandaranaike
Kumaratunga dissolved the Sri Lankan
Parliament with effect from mid-night
Saturday, 7 February 2004. The 13 th
Parliamentary election in Sri Lanka will be
held on 2 April 2004. The President
indicated that she would seek a four-point
popular mandate for (a) continuation of
peace negotiations with the LTTE (b)
abolition of Executive Presidency (c) revision
of the electoral system and (d) introduction
of market-oriented economic development
and guarantee of social justice.
Her decision to hold elections came after
unsuccessful negotiations for power-sharing
between the President and the Prime
Minister on key issues such as (i) dealing with
the Ceasefire Agreement between the Sri
Lankan Government and the LTTE (ii)
dealing with peace process negotiations and
(iii) good governance, electoral reforms etc.
Government of India’s Position
Gover nment of India has been
consulted by the senior political
leadership of Sri Lanka throughout.
Government of India supports the
actions of the Government of Sri
Lanka for a peaceful resolution of the
ethnic conflict within the territorial
integrity and unity of the country in a
manner satisfactory to the aspirations
of members of Sri Lankan society. It
believes that for a solution to be
enduring it must emerge purely
through an internal political process.
It has reiterated its commitment to the
unity, sovereignty and territor ial
integrity of Sri Lanka and to the
restoration of a lasting peace through
a peaceful negotiated settlement that
meets the just aspirations of all
elements of Sri Lankan society. India
would welcome resolution of the

current impasse in the peace process
and an early resumption of
negotiations.

In the Joint Statement issued during the Sri
Lankan Prime Ministers visit to India in
October 2003, it was stated that not only
will it maintain an abiding interest in the
security of Sri Lanka it would welcome a
resolution of the current impasse in the
peace process and an early resumption of
negotiations. Any interim arrangement
should be an integral part of the final
settlement and should be in the framework
of the unity and territorial integrity of Sri
Lanka. An important development during
the visit was Indias agreeing to Sri Lankan
Prime Ministers proposal for a defence
cooperation agreement.
High Level Visits
President Chandrika Bandaranaike
Kumaratunga made a working visit from 710 April 2003 to deliver the first Madhao

of Sri Lanka delivered the Millennium
Lecture 2003 of M.S. Swaminathan

South Asian economies.
The Prime Minister made a working visit
from 19-22 October 2003 to continue his
efforts to seek Indias and the international
communitys support for his Governments
action in the peace process. During this visit,
far-reaching decisions were taken on further
cooperation in defence and economic fields.
Defence Cooperation
Indias defence cooperation with Sri Lanka
consists of training its military personnel and
supply of equipment. A composite defence
team visited Sri Lanka from 1-5 September
2003 to assess Sri Lankan requirements.
This is expected to intensify once
negotiations on the Defence Cooperation
Agreement are concluded.
In May 2003, in response to Sri Lankas
request for assistance to its flood affected
areas, the assistance and despatch of relief
material by Indian Defence Forces was much
appreciated in Sri Lanka for the promptness
with which it arrived and the efficiency with
which it was delivered.
Economic Cooperation
Further liberalisation of the India-Sri Lanka
FTA and identifying new areas of economic
cooperation took bilateral trade in 2002 to
an unprecedented US$ 1 billion mark. This
figure is expected to exceed in 2003 as well.
The success of the India-Sri Lanka FTA
prompted the two countries to consider
negotiations for a CEPA that would facilitate
the integration of the two economies. A
Joint Study Group (JSG) was constituted to
examine a CEPA. It completed its
deliberations in September 2003 and
submitted its recommendation to the two
Prime Ministers who directed that
negotiations should commence early.
Mr. Rohitha Bogollagama, Sri Lankan
Minister of Industries visited from 20-27

farms. The Minister had a meeting with the
Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and offered
Indias assistance for exploration of natural
gas in Sri Lankan territorial waters. During

To increase physical connectivity between
India and Sri Lanka, the resumption of ferry

was considered but deferred following
concerns expressed by the Tamil Nadu
Government. The Sri Lankan Prime

ndia continued to pursue closer relations
with South East Asia in keeping with its
Look East Policy, building on its tremendous
historical and cultural linkages with the
region. India also articulated the expansion
of its Look East Policy to Phase II, beyond
South East Asia to the Pacific region. Regular
exchange of high level visits and interactions
at regional and multilateral fora have
contributed to a higher degree of comfort
and familiarity among the leaders, which in
turn helped in imparting fresh dynamism in
Indias relations with these countries.

Second India-ASEAN Summit
The high point in Indias contacts with the
region was the visit of Prime Minister Shri

5. The Gulf, West Asia and North Africa

Iraq

G

iven Indias long-standing political,
cultural and economic ties, India is
interested in the peace and prosperity of the
Gulf region and has, therefore, been
monitoring the developments in Iraq very
closely. Indias policies concerning
developments in Iraq are based on its
principles and national interest.
Government of Indias position has been
based on the unanimous Resolution adopted
by both Houses of Parliament on 8 April
2003. The Resolution deplored the military
action and stated that this action, with a view
to changing the government in Iraq was
unacceptable. The action also lacked the
specific sanction of the UN Security
Council. The Resolution called for
immediate secession of hostilities in Iraq and
quick withdrawal of Coalition forces. It also
called upon the UN to protect the
sovereignty of Iraq and to ensure the
reconstruction of Iraq under UN auspices.
India welcomed the signing of Iraqs interim
constitution on March 8 initiating the
process of handing over sovereignty to the
Iraqi people and hoped that the scheduled
dates of transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi
people will be adhered to.

India has consistently emphasized the need
for an early restoration of sovereignty to the
Iraqi people and reaffirmed the right of Iraqi
people to freely determine their political
future and control their natural resources.
It has stressed the crucial role of the UN in
the process of political and economic
reconstruction of Iraq. It had reiterated
these concerns to the 58th session of the UN
General Assembly on 25 September.
While UN Security Council (UNSC)
Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003 recognized
the status of the occupying powers and
provided a legal basis and international
mandate for administering Iraq on an
interim basis, the subsequent UNSC
Resolution 1511 of 16 October 2003
recognized the Governing Council and its
Ministers as the principal bodies of the Iraqi
Interim Administration, embodying the
sovereignty of the State of Iraq during the
transitional period until an internationally
#"

recognized, representative government is
established and assumes the responsibilities
of the Authority. Since then India has noted
the intention of the Coalition Authorities to
handover sovereignty to a Transitional
National Assembly by 30 June 2004 and that
the Iraqi Governing Council is working on
a roadmap for this purpose.
The arrest of Saddam Hussein by the
Coalition Authorities has been noted.
Various views have been expressed as to
where and how his trial should take place.
The judicial process will have to address
issues such as rights of Iraqi nationals, the
obligations of occupying powers under the
Geneva Convention, the need for
transparency and fairness of the judicial
process, etc. India believes that it is
essentially a question for the Iraqis to decide,
but in confor mity with well-known
international norms and principles. India
has taken note of the statements that the
Geneva Conventions will be respected and
it hopes for early improvement of the
security situation in Iraq. India is strongly
committed to assist the people of Iraq in
their humanitarian and reconstruction
efforts. In response to UN Secretary
Generals Flash Appeal, early this year, India
had committed US$20 million for assistance
to the Iraqi people. As the Donors
Conference held in Madrid from 23-24
October 2003, India has committed an
additional amount of US$10 million
through Trust Funds being coordinated by
the United Nation and International
Monetary Fund respectively for
reconstruction needs of Iraq. Government
of India is working on proposals for
assistance including medical assistance to a
hospital in Najaf, provision of computers,
assistance in the constitution development
process and human resource development
and training of Iraqi personnel, including
diplomats.
As part of the continuous efforts to assist
people of Iraq in humanitarian and
reconstruction efforts, India provided
training to 15 Iraqi diplomats for a period
of 6 weeks in February-March at the Foreign
Service Institute, New Delhi. An
Archaeological Team from Iraq visited India

in February and met senior officials in the
Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry
of Culture, on cooperation in retrieving the
artifacts stolen from Iraqi museums. 
Secretary, Asia and North Africa (ANA), Shri
R.M.Abhyankar led a delegation to the Iraq
Donors Conference in Abu Dhabi on 28
29 February 2004 that was hosted by the
UAE as follow up on the Madrid
Conference. India is one of the 13-member
Donor Committee that came formally into
existence at the conference. The conference
discussed the mechanism to spend the
pledged funds in the reconstruction of Iraq
through the two trust funds to be
administered by the World Bank and UN
respectively. India has pledged a total of US
$ 10 million to the two Trust Funds. This is
in addition to US $ 20 million being spent
on relief in Iraq bilaterally. The next
conference of Donors Committee will take
place in Doha in May 2004. 
An amount of US$ 1.2 million has been
provided to World Food Programme (WFP)
for procuring and distributing Infant
Formula milk i.e. dried whole milk powder
to the Iraqi people. India has also transferred
US$2.5 million to the Iraq Trust Fund. An
8-week training programme for 15 Iraqi
diplomats, organized by FSI in FebruaryMarch 2004, concluded this month. A six
weeks programme on communication and
information technology has been organized
by NIIT from 5 April-14 May under the
ITEC programme. There are 20 Iraqi
participants out of which 9 are female
participants.
The Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce & Industry (FICCI) sent their
business delegation to Iraq, which was
successful in reviving and renegotiating some
of the contracts that have been signed under
Oil for Food Programme with the concerned
Ministries in Iraq. Secretary (ANA) also
visited Iraq and the neighbouring countries
from 23-26 June 2003 and held wide-ranging
discussions with important leaders of Iraq
as well as the Governments of the
neighbouring countries. Indo-Iraq Business
Council of FICCI organized a conference

TEAM-9 Initiative
To give a boost to Indias relations with West
Africa, a new group was formed called
TEAM-9. This concept of TEAM-9
(Techno-Economic Approach for Africa
India Movement) is a partnership between
India and West Africa (the countries being
Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote dIvoire,
Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea Bissau,
Mali, Senegal). While this is a new approach,
it symbolizes, at heart, the essence of SouthSouth cooperation in todays world. India
has invited the eight West African countries
for becoming member of TEAM-9, which
aims at transfer of technology to The West
African countries with which India had a
little commercial and economic impact. The
First Ministerial Meeting of TEAM-9
country was held in New Delhi on 1 March
2004 at Vigyan Bhawan. 
It was decided that The TEAM-9
cooperation mechanism will operate at
Government, institutional and private sector
levels, sharing various types of expertise,
intellectual and physical resources as well as
economic opportunities for promoting
welfare, growth and prosperity of the people.
It would thus involve providing opportunities
for education and training in crucial sectors.
It would enable transfer of critical
technologies. It would imply undertaking
specific projects in individual TEAM-9
countries, which would have region-wide
beneficial impact in the sectors critical for
employment and growth such as agriculture,

small scale industries and rural development,
phar maceuticals and health care,
infor mation
technology
and
telecommunications, transport, energy etc.
The cooperation would derive synergy based
on the diverse capacities, capabilities of the
member countries.  
An MoU was signed and the
following decisions were taken:
n Identification, implementation of
priority projects and corporate
schemes in different sectors.
n Setting up a Business Council for
facilitating
identification,
entrepreneurship
and
implementation of specific projects.
n The Government of India would
provide concessional credit
facilities of US$ 500 million for
financial assistance for the various
projects and schemes identified for
implementation under this regional
cooperation mechanism. The credit
line will be administered through
EXIM Bank of India. The
Government of India also offered
access to training resources in
India and facilitate deputation of
Indian scientists, technologists and
other experts.

All participants also agreed upon a decisionmaking structure to formulate policies of
cooperation, to review progress as well as for
overall monitoring and coordination.

7. Europe

Central and Eastern Europe

I

ndia has traditionally enjoyed warm,
friendly and close relations, marked by
mutual goodwill, with the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Apart
from fostering Parliamentary and cultural
delegations, conscious efforts were made to
encourage political level exchanges during
the past year. Specifically, Indias excellent
and time-tested relations with Russia were
further bolstered with the Prime Minsters
visit to Moscow in November 2003.
The continued efforts to further develop,
diversify and strengthen Indias traditionally
warm, friendly and close relations with
countries of Central and Eastern Europe
(CEE) acquired greater significance with the
signing of Accession Treaties by eight
countries of the region for jointing the
European Union in May 2004, a few others
aspiring to join by 2007 and still others in
the next 10-12 years. The focus of the effort
was to gradually put the relationships with
these countries on a pedestal form where it
would be easier for India to work with them
for mutual benefit in the changed
geopolitical context.
The general approach continued to focus on
generating thrust for overall development of
bilateral relations through sustained
interaction at high level and between
political leadership of India with CEE
countries. In the period under review,
President of India visited Bulgaria apart
from the two visits of the Prime Minister to
the Russian Federation, and incoming visits
by the President of Armenia, Prime Minister
of Hungary and Deputy Prime Ministers of
Latvia and Serbia & Montenegro, besides
Foreign Ministers of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Russia and Ukraine.
Representatives of Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Russia
visited India to attend the InterParliamentary Conference held from 22-27
January 2003 marking the Golden Jubilee
of the Indian Parliament. There have been
high level bilateral exchanges with 13 CEE
countries in areas including science and
technology, IT, defence, culture and
%

education. These made it possible to
maintain the continuity and the momentum
in these ties and to reinvigorate them. There
were Parliamentary exchanges with Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania
Russia and Ukraine. Regular Foreign Office
Consultations were also given due attention.
Protocol on Foreign Office Consultations
(FOC) with Albania was signed during the
visit of then Secretary (EAA) Shri Shashank
to Tirana on 4 - 5 February 2003 when the
first round of the FOC was also held.
Special efforts were devoted to qualitatively
enhance bilateral trade and investment with
CEE countries. Joint Commissions, Joint
Committees and Joint Business Councils
were reinvigorated. FICCI and CII were
encouraged to organise a number of events
in India and Missions in CEE countries. This
period also saw significant investment activity
by Non Resident Indians (NRIs) in the CEE
countries. For example, large steel mills in
Bosnia & Herzegovina, Poland and Romania
were taken over by NRIs. A large business
delegation accompanying the Prime
Minister on his recent visit to Russia in
November 2003 had useful interaction with
their Russian counterparts.
An important dimension of Indias relations
with CEE countries is the increased
interaction and cooperation in combating
international terrorism. Agreements and
treaties on this subject and related areas were
signed with some more CEE countries.
Interaction between national security
agencies (for example, with Poland) was
nurtured.

Armenia
The high point of Indo-Armenian relations

perspectives. FICCI and CII jointly
organized a large business meeting, which

year, with several high-level exchanges and
continued interaction at the institutional
level. India and the UK share an assessment
that the bilateral relationship is a key foreign
policy priority. UK Prime Minister Tony
Blair has described India as a strategic
partner. In a December 2003 Government
White Paper titled UK International
Priorities: A Strategy for the FCO, the UK
identified India as one of four key countries
(the other three being Russia, China and
Japan) with which the UK wishes to build a
stronger strategic partnership. The paper
described India as an important democratic
power in Asia, with increasing potential to
exert global political and economic influence
and with particular strength in leading
growth sectors.

unequivocally condemning terrorist
attacks in India. A Joint UK-US
statement on 27 March 2003

occurs and whatever its purported
justification”. It also said that “the Line
of Control should be strictly respected
and Pakistan should fulfill its
commitments to stop infiltration across
it. UK has continued to publicly
reiterate its suppor t for India’s
candidature
for
per manent
membership of the UN Security
Council.

opportunity of his visit to India to make a
bilateral call on National Security Advisor
on 16 February 2004.
The EU continues to be Indias single largest
trading partner with a share of over 24% of
Indias exports and about 25% of its imports.
The total bilateral trade during 2002-2003
was US$ 23.86 billion, out of which India
exported US$11.35 billion worth of goods
to the EU and imported goods worth
US$12.51 billion from the EU. Total
bilateral trade grew by 17.71% compared
to the figures for 2001-2002
The EU also continues to be an important
source of FDI for India, with the 15 member
states taken together being the largest source
of investments. Cumulative FDI approvals
for the EU, for the period 1991-2003, have
been approximately US$16.26 billion, at
about 21% of total approvals accorded1 so
far. The most important countries in the EU15 for FDI are UK, Ger many, and
Netherlands, followed by France, Italy and
Belgium. Out of these approved figures for
FDI, only about US$5.33 billion have
actually flown in, the realisation rate working
out to 32%.
EU development cooperation assistance to
India has generally been focused in the areas
of environment, public health and
education. As a second phase of its
programme on education, the EC has made
a commitment of US$200 million for the
Sarva Shiksha Abiyaan (SSA) Programme,
envisaged for the development of primary
education covering 42 districts. The EC has
drafted a new development cooperation
strategy for its relations with India,
articulated in its Country Strategy Paper for India
2002-2006, under which it has committed 
225 million for this period. Unlike in earlier
years, the sectoral approach has now been
replaced with a state-partnership approach.
Chattisgarh and Rajasthan have been
proposed for selection by the EC, under this
programme.

Commonwealth
As the Commonwealths largest member,
one of its largest financial contributors, and

an active proponent of its fundamental
political values and principles, India enjoys
a prominent position in the Commonwealth.
Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee led
the Indian delegation to the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM),
which was held in Abuja from 4-8 December
2003. The outcomes of the Abuja CHOGM
are detailed in the Abuja Communiqué and
the Aso Rock Declaration on the special
theme of the CHOGM, Democracy and
Development: Partnership for Peace and
Prosperity. A separate Statement on
Multilateral Trade was also adopted, with
the objective of a forward-looking and
development oriented approach to
international trade issues after the recent
breakdown of WTO talks at Cancun.
India participated actively in the meetings
of various Commonwealth committees and
organisations. External Affairs Minister, Shri
Yashwant Sinha represented India at the 21st
and 22nd meetings of the CMAG held at
London and New York in May and
September 2003, as well as the special
meeting of the CMAG held at Abuja on
December 4, 2003, ahead of the CHOGM.
At the Abuja CHOGM, India was named
for a renewed two-year term as a member
of CMAG. India is also a member of the
Commonwealth Committee on Terrorism
set up in January 2002, as part of the
Commonwealths efforts to build the
capacity of member countries in fulfilling
their obligations under UN Security Council
Resolution 1373. External Affairs Minister,
Shri Yashwant Sinha attended a meeting of
the Commonwealth Committee on
Terrorism in New York in September 2003.
External Affairs Minister, Shri Yashwant
Sinha also represented India at the
Ministerial Group on Small States Meeting
in Abuja on 4 December 2003. India was
also represented at the Ministerial level in
the Meeting of Commonwealth Law
Ministers in London in May 2003. Minister
of Law and Justice and Commerce and
Industry, Shri Arun Jaitley, attended the
meeting that aimed to draw up principles on
good practice governing relations between
the executive, legislature and judiciary in the

Europe

promotion of good governance, the rule of
law and human rights. Minister for Human
Resources Development, Science and
Technology and Ocean Development, Shri
Murli Manohar Joshi, attended the Meeting
of Commonwealth Education Ministers in
Edinburgh in October 2003.
India also participated at the Senior Official
level at the meeting of Commonwealth
Finance Ministers in Brunei in September
2003. During 2003, India was also a member
of the Commonwealth Intergovernmental
Committee to Review the Mandates of
Commonwealth Organizations. India
continued to contribute actively to the
ongoing activities of the Commonwealth
Fund for Technical Co-operation,

Commonwealth Youth Programme,
Commonwealth Science Council, and the
Commonwealth
Foundation
and
Commonwealth Media Development Fund.
Indias successful bid to host the 2010
Commonwealth Games is a reaffirmation of
the important role India plays in the
Commonwealth. On 13 November 2003, at
a meeting of the General Body of the
Commonwealth Games Federation at
Montego Bay, Jamaica, New Delhi won its
bid to host the 2010 Games over Hamilton,
Canada by a vote of 46-22. The Indian
delegation to the meeting was led by Minister
for Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri Vikram
Verma. India will be the second Asian nation
after Malaysia to host the Commonwealth
Games.

United States
Since January 2001, the Bush Presidency has
repeatedly voiced its commitment to
complete the process of qualitative
transformation in India-US relations in
recognition of Indias status as an emerging
world power and the many common
strategic interests that the two countries share
in Asia and beyond. This view was reiterated
by President Bush in his meeting with Prime
Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 9
November 2001, and formally made a part
of President Bushs National Security
Strategy Document in September 2002.
Secretary of State Colin Powells foreign
policy speech on 5 September 2003
described India as a major world power with
whom the United States must focus to
develop its relationship.
As a result, India and the United States
remained intensively engaged in 2003 across
a full spectrum of issues: combating
international terrorism, peacekeeping,
defence, strategic issues, science and
technology, health, trade, space, energy and
environment. The most visible symbol of this
bilateral engagement is the high frequency
of bilateral visits at political and official
levels, and the existence of Bilateral
Dialogue Architecture, now comprising
more than 15 institutional dialogues. The
Prime Minister met President Bush in New
York on 24 September 2003 and briefly at
St. Petersburg on 31 May 2003. The Deputy
Prime Minister visited the United States in
June 2003 when he met President Bush.
Other high-level exchanges in 2003 include
visits by National Security Adviser to the
United States in May 2003 (which included
a brief meeting with President Bush) and by
US Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage in May 2003. The External Affairs
Minister, Shri Yashwant Sinha visited
Washington DC in January 2004 and had
meetings with President Bush, Secretary
Powell and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice. He had earlier met
Secretary of State Colin Powell in Moscow
in May 2003 and in Phnom Penh in June
2003. In addition, the Commerce and
Industry Minister visited the United States
in May 2003 and the Power Minister in June
&&

2003. Foreign Secretary visited Washington
DC in June  July 2003. Defence Secretary
co-chaired the fifth meeting of the India-US
Defence Policy Group in Washington DC in
August 2003.
During the year, the most significant progress
in bilateral cooperation occurred in the
realm of bilateral strategic dialogue between
India and the United States on the Quartet
Issues comprising cooperation in civilian
space programme, civilian nuclear
programme, trade in dual use hightechnology and missile defence. During their
meeting in New York in September 2002,
the Prime Minister and President Bush
agreed to explore cooperation opportunities
in these areas.
Then Foreign Secretary Shri Kanwal Sibal
visited US from 3-5 February 2003 during
which he met US Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Ar mitage, National Security
Advisor Stephen Hadley, Under Secretary
for Commerce Kenneth Juster, Under
Secretary for Defence Douglas Feith, Under
Secretary for Global Affairs at the State
Department Paula Dobriansky and Under
Secretary for Political Affairs at the State
Department Mare Grossman. During the
visit, India and the United States reached
an agreement on principles governing hightechnology commerce including trade in
dual-use technology between the two
countries, reflecting their new relationship
and common strategic interests. The two
sides agreed to take steps to promote and
facilitate such trade by addressing systemic
barriers; generating market awareness;
undertaking promotional activities;
conducting industry outreach programmes;
reviewing policies and processes on export
of dual-use goods and technologies to India;
and pursuing export control cooperation.
Director of Policy Planning in the State
Department Richard Haass visited New
Delhi in January 2003 for broad ranging
discussion on Indo-US relations.
An important milestone was crossed
on 12-13 January 2004, when the
leaders of the two countries issued,
in their respective capitals, a joint

statement that describes the next
steps in the India - United States
strategic partnership. These steps
include an expansion of cooperation
in civilian nuclear activities, civilian
space programmes and hightechnology trade together with an
expanded dialogue on missile
defence. Bilateral cooperation
between India and the United States
in these areas will deepen the ties of
commerce between the two nations
and promote stability. In this context,
the two sides have established a High
Technology Cooperation Group
(HTCG), the first that the United
States has with any country.

This Group met in Washington DC in July
2003 and in New Delhi in November 2003.
Significant progress was made during the
HTCG meetings when the two sides agreed
to take appropriate regulatory and
promotional measures to stimulate India-US
high-technology commerce, including trade
in dual-use goods and technologies.
The area of defence cooperation continued
to see major progress. In 2003, the two sides
continued to strengthen their institutional
framework of engagement in the area of
defence and build on the foundation for
resumption of defence relations that was laid
during the resumed Defence Policy Group
meeting in December 2001. In addition to
the high level exchanges, broad based
engagement continued through institutional
mechanisms. A delegation from Ministry of
Defence and Ministry of External Affairs
participated in an India-US bilateral
workshop on missile defence was held in New
Delhi in January 2003.The apex level
Defence Policy Group met again in August
2003. The bilateral Executive Steering
Groups of the Army, Navy and Air Force,
the Security Cooperation Group to
coordinate defence supply relationship, and
the Joint Technical Group to advance R &
D collaboration in defence production
(including in Indias Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) project) meet every six months.
During the year, the two sides conducted

Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee calls on US President George W. Bush, 16-28 September 2003.

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

mutually beneficial combined exercises in
India and the United States, expert
exchanges and joint training as also
revitalized defence research & development
cooperation and defence supplies
relationship. As part of facilitating the
bilateral defence cooperation, the enabling
bilateral agreements such as the General
Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA) and intelligence sharing
agreements are now in place and military
contacts, exchanges and exercises are
developing their own internal dynamics.
As part of their continuous dialogue on
international security issues, India and the
United States have ongoing consultations in
the area of missile defence. A workshop was
held with US experts in Delhi in January
2003, followed by a visit in June 2003 by
Indian experts to a missile defence workshop
in Japan. India was also invited as observer
in Roving Sands missile defence exercise
in Texas in June 2003, which was cancelled
due to the war in Iraq. An expanded dialogue
with the United States on missile defence is
now a part of the Next Steps on Strategic
Partnership.
An important emerging element of the
bilateral engagement between India and US
has been cooperation on combating
international terrorism. The terrorist attacks
in the United States on 11 September 2001
and on the Indian Parliament on 13
December 2001 have led to a deepening of
Indo-US cooperation in this field. The
United States acknowledges Pakistans links
with, and its Governments responsibility to
stop, cross-border terrorism in India.
Accordingly, the United States has, under its
own law, designated and proscribed a
number of Pakistan-based terrorist
organisations such as Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT),
Jaish-e-Mohammed and Harkat-ulMujahideen. On 16 October 2003, the
United States declared Dawood Ibrahim as
a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The
designation recognizes Dawood Ibrahims
underworld and terrorist connections, his
efforts to destabilise India, his involvement
in the 1993 Mumbai bombings and his
support to LeT. This subsequently led to the
inclusion of his name in the United Nations
'

listing as well. On 29 October 2003, a key
US State Department official described
India as a victim of terrorism and asserted
that the US was asking Pakistan to redouble
its efforts to stop infiltration and prevent
extremist groups operating on its soil from
crossing the Line of Control.
India and the United States have a Joint
Working Group on Counter-Terrorism that
was established in January 2000 and has met
five times. The Joint Working Group focuses
on expanding mutually beneficial
cooperation in counter-terrorism capacity,
institution building, training programmes,
intelligence and investigative cooperation
and counter-terrorism technology. Due to
scheduling problems, the sixth meeting of
this Working Group could not be held in
2003.
The United States has publicly, privately and
repeatedly conveyed strong appreciation of
Prime Ministers peace initiative towards
Pakistan, describing it as a far-reaching act
of statesmanship. President Bush himself
conveyed these sentiments to the Prime
Minister during their conversation in St.
Petersburg in May 2003 and in New York in
September 2004. On 6 January 2004, the
US Secretary of State Colin Powell
described the Vajpayee-Musharraf meeting
in Islamabad as a historic meeting that had
opened new opportunities for achieving
peace. The State Department termed the
India  Pakistan joint statement at Islamabad
as a historic development that had been
taken through a series of acts of
statesmanship. While expressing hope for
normalization of relations and eventual
resumption of India-Pakistan dialogue, the
United States maintains that it is for the two
countries to resolve all outstanding issues
bilaterally and that while the United States
would be willing to play a facilitating role in
creating an atmosphere for the dialogue
process, it does not seek a mediatory role
between the two countries. During the year,
the United States continued to recognize that
cross-border terrorism continues and has
repeatedly stated that it continues to press
President Musharraf to end infiltration and
take action on terrorist camps.

On 18 March 2004, Secretary of State Mr.
Colin Powell announced in Islamabad that
the US had decided to designate Pakistan as
a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA). India
expressed its disappointment at the manner
of the announcement. Secretary Powell tried
to reach External Affairs Minister after the
announcement and spoke to him on 21
March explaining that the intention had not
been to spring a surprise on India. The US
conveyed its offer of considering a similar
status for India; India has not given any
consideration to any such proposal. India is
studying the implications of this US
announcement, in relation to Pakistan, that
would become clearer once it is notified by
the US President to the Congress.
As part of the exchange of views with our
major partners on issues of regional and
international interest, India and the United
States continued their discussions on the
situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US
Administration expressed interest in Indian
involvement in post-war stabilisation
operations in Iraq in early May 2003. Wideranging consultations were held by India
with the United States, UN, Iraqs
neighbours, other concerned countries as
well as the Iraqi people. The Government
also sought to reach a national consensus on
the issue. A decision was taken on the US
request, taking into account Indias longer
term national interests, our concern for the
people of Iraq, our long-standing ties with
the Gulf region as a whole, as well as our
growing dialogue and strengthened ties with
the United States. While the US State
Department reaction on 14 July 2003,
expressed US hope that India would have
made a different choice, that they would be
there, it also reiterated that India remains
an important strategic partner for the
United States, and that the continuation of
the transformation of Indo-US relations is
something thats important to us and that
we expect to see. In recognition of our
concerns, the US Secretary of State Colin
Powell said in an interview on 22 September
2003 that though India had a large standing
body of troops, it was probably politically
too difficult for India to send any troops to
Iraq. Indias potential for contribution to the

The Americas

post-war reconstruction and development
efforts in Iraq is recognised by the United
States.
India and US have also maintained a regular
dialogue regarding developments
concerning Afghanistan. The two countries
remain
engaged
on
economic
reconstruction, security situation and future
political evolution in Afghanistan, and held
discussions on these issues in New Delhi,
Washington and at various multilateral fora.
An emerging area of close consultations
between India and the United States is
developments in Asia, including South Asia.
With a growing US engagement in the
region, the two sides decided to hold regular
dialogue on South Asia, in order to
coordinate and harmonize the respective
approaches to the region. A Regional Forum
dialogue germinated out of these discussions,
the second round of which was held during
US Assistant Secretary of State, Christina
Roccas visit to New Delhi in September
2003. The two governments have also agreed
to institutionalize dialogue on other areas of
mutual interest, including East, Southeast
and Central Asia.
As part of the process of strengthening the
strategic framework of relations, the two
countries are seeking to build closer bilateral
consultations on multilateral issues. In this
context, the two Gover nments have
launched a bilateral Global Issues Forum to
enhance consultation on multilateral social
and economic issues of mutual interest.
Foreign Secretary held talks under this
Forum with the US Under Secretary for
Global Affairs, Paula Dobriansky in
February 2003. There is also an ongoing
dialogue on human rights issues in the
multilateral context. The United States has
also proposed a similar forum to improve
consultation and coordination on political
issues in the UN General Assembly. The two
countries already have a Joint Working
Group on UN Peacekeeping issues, which
has enabled closer India-US coordination on
peacekeeping issues in the UN in New York
as also in policy discussions in the two
capitals. The Group had its fourth meeting
in Washington in October 2003.

The bilateral Agreement between India and
the United States regarding non-surrender
of persons to international tribunals that had
been signed in December 2002 came into
force in December 2003. The Agreement
protects the primacy of national judicial
institutions from a potential impingement by
international tribunals like the International
Criminal Court that India and the United
States do not recognize. Under the
Agreement, nationals of both countries are
protected from being handed over to any
international tribunal by either country
without explicit consent of the other country.
India-US bilateral trade in goods in
2002 increased to about US$ 16 billion
and trade in services to about US$ 810 billion. US direct investment
declined to about US $ 250 million and
portfolio investments to less than US
$ 1.0 billion. However, against decline
in both overall US exports and imports
in 2002, India’s exports to the United
States grew 21.4% to reach US$ 12
billion, and came close behind the
22.4 % growth in China’s exports,
although the growth in India’s case
was on a substantially narrower base.
US exports to India, stagnant in recent
years, grew 9.1% in 2002 to about
US$ 4.1 billion. Services trade grew
by about 20%. In the nine-month
period January – September 2003,
while India’s exports rose by 13.08%
over the corresponding period in 2002,
US exports to India increased by over
24%.

Secretary of State Colin Powell’s
visit to India
The US Secretary of State Colin Powell
made a working visit to New Delhi on 15
17 March 2004. During this visit, Secretary
Powell called on the Prime Minister and had
extensive discussions with the External
Affairs Minister, Finance Minister and
National Security Advisor on 16 March
2004. This was Secretary Powells first visit
to India since July 2002 and followed
External Affairs Ministers visit to
Washington DC in January 2004.

Secretary Powells visit focused on bilateral
issues, especially economic relations. The
two sides discussed issues related to the Next
Steps in Strategic Partnership and Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO). To give an
impetus to bilateral economic relations, it
was decided to restructure the bilateral
economic dialogue, in partnership with the
private sector, to attain specific trade and
investment targets. Secretary Powell clarified
that the US was not seeking a quid pro quo on
outsourcing in terms of market access in
India. The two sides also discussed nuclear
proliferation from Pakistan. Secretary Powell
was appreciative of Indias effort to take
forward the peace dialogue with Pakistan
and agreed that the end of cross-border
activity along the LoC needed to remain
permanent beyond the winter months. Issues
of international concern that included
developments in Iraq and Afghanistan were
also discussed during this visit.

Canada
Relations with Canada were marked by a
process of re-engagement, which was
supported by both countries. Canada
identified India as one of the four countries
in the world (with China, Mexico and Brazil)
that present Canada with new opportunities
for productive partnerships. It also identified
India, along with China and Japan, as one
of the key countries in Asia for developing
close ties. The year witnessed greater
involvement of the Indian-Canadian
community as an emerging factor in relations
between the two countries. Two high-level
visits took place from Canada to India in
quick succession in October 2003. Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chrètien visited India
on 24-25 October 2003 with a delegation
including the Canadian Minister for Natural
Resources, two Members of the Canadian
Parliament, one Privy Council Member, four
prominent Indian-Canadians besides senior
officials.
A Joint Statement entitled “Partners
for the 21st Century” was released after
talks between two Prime Ministers,
outlining their vision to strengthen

'

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

government, commercial and civil
society linkages between India and
Canada. The Statement, inter alia,
committed the two countries to
deepen their engagement to
strengthen international and regional
peace and security; prevent
proliferation of nuclear weapons;
enhance their strategic dialogue;
upgrade Canadian representation in
India; promote cooperation on
counter-terrorism; formalise an annual
dialogue on global issues; and hold
annual high-level trade policy
consultations. The Canadian Prime
Minister inaugurated the Canadian
Consulate General in Chandigarh and
announced upgradation of the
Consulate in Mumbai to Consulate
General.

Just preceding this high level visit, Canadian
Foreign Minister Bill Graham held wideranging talks with External Affairs Minister
during his visit to India on 13 October 2003.
He conveyed that the Canadian Export
Development Corporation had identified
India as a major market for Canadian
exports and that Canada wanted cross
investment in information technology and
other emerging technologies. The two
Ministers also signed an agreement for
promoting cooperation between the Foreign
Service Institutes of the two countries, under
which two Canadian diplomats would attend
Foreign Service Institutes programmes in
New Delhi in 2003-2004.
The year also saw an expanded interface
between different Ministries of the two
Governments. The Canadian Minister of
Industry, Mr. Allan Rock held talks in India
with the Minister of State for Commerce and
Industry and the government of the state of
Maharashtra from 15-19 October 2003 and
a six-member delegation of the Canadian
Parliament Standing Committee on Foreign
Affairs met their counterparts from the
Parliament Standing Committee on External
Affairs in Delhi from 20-22 October 2003.
The Premiers of British Columbia and
Alberta visited India from 8-12 November
2003 and 11-16 January 2004 respectively.
'

The Canadian Minister for Agriculture
visited India from 4-10 December 2003 and
held talks with his counterpart.

to promote cooperation amongst themselves
in diverse fields and to voice jointly the
demands and concerns of the South.

The newly appointed Canadian Minister of
State for New and Emerging Markets, Mr.
Gar Knutson visited India from 25-30
January 2004. He held discussions with the
Minister of State (Independent Charge) for
Information and Broadcasting and Secretary,
Civil Aviation to identify areas of
cooperation and mutual interest in the fields
of information and broadcasting and civil
aviation. Mr. Gar Knutson has the specific
mandate of exploring further cooperation
with the three countries  India, China and
Brazil  identified by the Government of
Canada as new and emerging markets.

From the region, the Presidents of Suriname
and Guyana visited India during the year.
The Foreign Ministers of Colombia, Chile
and Brazil also paid highly successful visits
that have helped in a better understanding
and appreciation of each others views on a
variety of issues and matters of mutual
interest and concern to India. A CARICOM
delegation comprising the Foreign Minister
of Jamaica and the Secretary-General of
CARICOM also visited India in November
2003 and paved the way for the
establishment of an institutional linkage for
regular political dialogue between
CARICOM and India with the signing of
an agreement to set up a standing Joint
Commission on consultation, cooperation
and coordination between the Caribbean
community and the Government of India.

In a statement issued on 6 January 2004
regarding the meeting between Indian Prime
Minister and Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf on 5 January 2004, on the
margins of the 12th SAARC Summit in
Islamabad, Canadian Foreign Minister Bill
Graham said he welcomed the positive
development in relations between India and
Pakistan as an important step toward finding
a peaceful solution to their outstanding
issues.

Latin America
This year has seen a far greater level of
engagement between India and the countries
of the region in pursuance of Indias policy
of strengthening and deepening our relations
with countries in Latin America. External
Affairs Minister, Shri Yashwant Sinha had
very fruitful visits to Brazil and Peru in June
2003. These were the first ever visits by an
Indian Foreign Minister to these countries.
While in Peru he signed an agreement on a
mechanism for political consultation and
cooperation with the Community of
ANDEAN nations (CAN). During his visit
to Brazil, apart from covering a wide range
of issues pertaining to bilateral, regional and
international topics of mutual interest, the
unique trilateral initiative  the India, Brazil
and South Africa (IBSA) Dialogue Forum
was launched. It was for the first time that
three major countries of the South
representing three continents came together

Indias relations with Latin America and the
Caribbean countries were further widened
and deepened through certain important
initiatives taken in recent months including
the signing of a framework agreement with
the Market of Southern Cone countries
(MERCOSUR), the Community of
ANDEAN nations (CAN), the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) and finalization
of agreements with Association of
Caribbean States (ACS), Association of
Central American States and the Rio-Group
Troika, with the aim of finally entering into
free trade/preferential trade agreements
with countries of this region.
The first meeting of the System of Central
American Integration (SICA) took place in
New Delhi on 2 February 2004, with the
External Affairs Minister, Shri Yashwant
Sinha, meeting a delegation of Foreign
Ministers and other dignitaries from the
countries that make up the SICA (Belize,
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and
Dominican Republic). For institutionalizing
the mechanism for interactions with the
SICA Group of countries, an Agreement for
the Establishment of a Mechanism of
Political Consultations and Cooperation was
signed between India and SICA.

The Americas

In keeping with the trade trends of Latin
America, a positive trend emerged in trade
between India and countries of the region
as a consequence of the thrust given to the
promotion of trade and commerce between
India and the region. The bilateral trade
increased from US$ 473.66 million in 199192 to US$ 2445.44 million in 2001-02
leading to an increased awareness on both
sides, of the potential and possibilities of
trade between India and the Latin American
Countries (LAC).
At the multilateral level, India and the
countries of the region showed a great deal
of commonality of approach on a number
of multilateral issues pertaining to the reform
of the UN system, the WTO, the
environment, etc. This approach was in
much evidence during the Cancun
Ministerial Meeting through the continued
joint efforts and coordination by the Group
of 20.
It is a matter of great satisfaction that since
the commencement of the Focus LAC
Programme in 1997, which is continuing,
Indias relations with countries of this region
have continued to make important strides
and that areas of cooperation in diverse fields
have grown significantly. In an increasingly
global environment, distance and language
barriers were no longer allowed to come in
the way of closer cooperation between India
and the countries of the LAC region. Given
the size and potential of the region, it has
remained an important aspect of our overall
policy to consolidate ties with this
increasingly important region of the world.

Argentina
Indias relations with Argentina remained
cordial and friendly. The Embassy
collaborated with a local cultural
organisation Kororu Darshan to host a cultural
programme called Sacred India in MarchApril 2003. In the following months, the
Embassy held an exhibition of Indian dolls
and dresses, organised an exhibition of
paintings on India by a local artist, held the
performance of Rajasthani Folk dance in
Buenos Aires and in Rosario city in the Santa
Fe province, all sponsored by the ICCR.  

Paraguay
On 17 June 2003 the Mercosur countries and
India signed the India-Mercosur Framework
Agreement on Cooperation in Asunción
during the 24th Mercosur Summit. Minister
of State for Commerce and Industry Shri
S.B. Mukherjee signed the agreement on
behalf of Government of India while
Foreign Ministers of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay signed on behalf of
Mercosur. The agreement would contribute
to the expansion of the bilateral commerce
and the development of closer relations
amongst India and Mercosur countries.

Brazil

India has received positive signals to its
expression of interest to develop bilateral

9. United Nations & International Organisations

T

he UN system, its role and relevance in
the international order, its efficacy and
limitations came under scrutiny during the
year. Continuing acts of international
terrorism and developments surrounding
Iraq overshadowed discussions in the UN
and other international organizations. The
United Nations launched new Peace
Keeping Operations in Liberia and Cote
dIvoire and maintained its activities in the
areas of human rights, socio-economic
development, humanitarian activities etc.
India continued to play a prominent role in
discussions at the UN, and often played a
role in building consensus on important
questions, while preserving and promoting
its interests as a developing country, with a
perspective of its own on key international
issues.

The 58th Session of the UN
General Assembly
The 58th session in September was held in
the aftermath of the Iraq war. The impact
of unilateral action on the future of
multilateralism and the UN was a constant
theme that ran through the general debate,
in which a large number of world leaders
participated. The impression that the UNs
role and relevance had been challenged
following the unilateral war in Iraq,
appeared to have been replaced by a
recognition of the limits of unilateralism and
a renewed commitment to multilateralism.
In this context, there was also an awareness
of the need to revisit issues relating to the
fundamentals of the international order, to
look at new threats and challenges as also
the institutions to deal with them and the
necessity of reforms in the UN system.
In his speech to the General Assembly, UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan emphasized
the urgent need to focus on UN reforms and
the adequacy and effectiveness of the UNs
organs, especially the need for a more
representative Security Council. With a view
to comprehensively addressing the issue of
UN refor ms, the Secretary General
established a sixteen member High-Level
Panel of Eminent Personalities on Global
Security, Threats and Refor m of the


International System. The Panel has been
tasked with examining the major threats
and challenges the world faces in the broad
field of peace and security, including
economic and social issues in so far as they
relate to peace and security, and making
recommendations for the elements of a
collective response. Based on the Panels
report, the Secretary General would make
recommendations to the 59th session of the
General Assembly next year. The 58th
session also looked at some practical steps
towards UN refor m, including
revitalisation of the General Assembly and
review of the current planning and
budgetary processes.
The situation in Iraq was a subject of
considerable concern and focus in the 58th
session of the General Assembly. Although
there were shades of differences and a
feeling of uncertainty about the road
ahead, there appeared to be a growing
recognition in the inter national
community, of the need to empower the
Iraqis and to move towards a speedy
restoration of Iraqi sovereignty, as also an
enlarged role for the UN in this process.
The General Assembly also reiterated the
importance of combating terrorism. The
other major issues that engaged the
attention of world leaders were the
situations in the Middle East and
Afghanistan.
Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
led the Indian delegation to the 58th session
and addressed the General Assembly on
25 September 2003. In his speech, the
Prime Minister said that the Iraq crisis had
emphasized the urgent need for an
enlarged and restructured Security
Council, with more developing countries
as per manent and non-per manent
members. Expressing concern for the
suffering of the people of Iraq, Prime
Minister stressed the imperative need to
empower the Iraqi people to determine
their own future and the immediate priority
of ensuring security, restoring basic
infrastructure, and outlining a political
roadmap for a representative Iraqi
Government. He also reiterated Indias

continued support for efforts to combat
international terrorism. Prime Minister had
bilateral meetings with the Heads of State /
Government of the United States, Brazil,
South Africa, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Nigeria,
Ukraine, Portugal, Afghanistan, Russian
Federation, and Zimbabwe. He participated
in a meeting with the Presidents of Brazil and
South Africa in the context of the India-BrazilSouth Africa initiative [IBSA].
External Affairs Minister, Shri Yashwant
Sinha accompanied the Prime Minister to the
General Assembly session. He had separate
bilateral meetings with a large number of his
counter parts. These included Foreign
Ministers of Algeria, Arab League,
Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Chile, Egypt, France,
Germany, Iraqi Governing Council, Israel,
Mauritius, Myanmar, Palestinian National
Authority, Philippines, Romania, Senegal,
Spain, Sudan, Sweden, UK and Vietnam. For
the first time, the External Affairs Minister met
with Foreign Ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council and of the Rio Group.
He participated in two trilateral meetings, one
with China and the Russian Federation, and
the other with Brazil and South Africa. He
also had a separate meeting with UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The External
Affairs Minister attended meetings of the
Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, the
Commonwealth, Asia Cooperation Dialogue,
and SAARC. He also had extensive
interactions with the international and Indian
media during his stay in New York.
The General Assembly had a special meeting
on 22 September 2003 to review the progress
achieved in the implementation of the
outcome of the special session on HIV/AIDS.
It also held a high-level dialogue on the followup to the Monterrey conference on financing
for development on 29-30 October 2003.
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri
Vinod Khanna participated in the meeting.
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri
Digvijay Singh spoke in the General Assembly
on 10 December 2003, which commemorated
the 55th anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human rights and

and Programme of Action.

United Nations and International Organisations

The Security Council
In the year 2003, India participated in 12
open meetings of the Security Council on
issues of importance such as the situation
between Iraq and Kuwait, Middle East,
Afghanistan, Timor-Leste as well as on
thematic issues such as threats to
international peace and security caused by
terrorist acts, women and peace and security,
role of the Security Council in the pacific
settlement of disputes and protection of
civilians in armed conflict.
The Working Group on the question of
reform of the Security Council met four
times during the year. The Working Group
achieved a modest degree of success in
discussions on the working methods of the
Security Council. There was expectedly no
agreement on the core issues pertaining to
expansion of the reformed Security Council.
India continued to participate actively in the
discussions of the Working Group. Indias
candidature for permanent membership in
a reformed Security Council received further
expressions of support during the year.
Political Issues
India made statements on all issues of
political and strategic importance at the 58th
United Nations General Assembly plenary,
including Afghanistan, the Question of
Palestine, the situation in the Middle East
and International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA).
Iraq
India participated in open meetings of
the Security Council on the situation
between Iraq and Kuwait held on 18
February, 11 March and 26 March
2003. In these statements, India called
for an early end to the hostilities and
for ensuring that the sovereignty,
integrity and secular traditions of Iraq
were fully preserved. Underlining the
right of the Iraqi people to determine
their political future and control their
resources, India emphasized the need
to secure lasting peace and a stable
future for the Iraqi people. India also
announced its willingness to fully
participate in the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of Iraq.

On 27 January 2003, an important report
by the Arms Inspectors was placed before
the Security Council. Discussions on the
need for Iraqs compliance, the report of the
Arms Inspectors and further action by the
Security Council and the International
community continued. By February, the
situation pertaining to Iraq had reached crisis
proportions and the possibility of military
operations against Iraq with or without the
UN mandate had become a critical issue.
Indias position was of commitment to
resolution of the problem through the UN
and the multilateral process. The situation
in Iraq dominated the work of the Security
Council throughout the year, which adopted
landmark Resolutions 1483, 1500 and 1511.
Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003 granted
interim governing powers to the United
States and its coalition partners in Iraq, a
role for a UN Special Representative
working with this coalition and lifting of
sanctions imposed on Iraq. India welcomed
Resolution 1483, as in its view, the adoption
of the resolution enabled the international
community to help the long suffering people
of Iraq and reaffirmed principles important
to India, such as the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq; the right of the
Iraqi people to freely determine their
political future and control their natural
resources; the existence, to an extent, of an
inter nationally accepted roadmap for
rebuilding Iraq and the involvement of the
Secretary Generals representative in this
process.
Resolution 1500 of 14 August 2003
reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Iraq, welcomed the
establishment of the Governing Council of
Iraq and set up for an initial period of 12
months, the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq
(UNAMI) to coordinate the UNs
humanitarian and other activities in Iraq.
Resolution 1511 of 16 October 2003 called
on the Coalition Provisional Authority in
Iraq to return governing authority to the
Iraqi people as soon as practicable and
invited the Iraqi Governing Council to
provide a timetable for drafting a new
constitution and holding of democratic
elections by 15 December 2003. India

welcomed the unanimous adoption of
Resolution 1511 as a positive step towards
the restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi
people although it noted that the Resolution
lacked specificity regarding the timing of the
transfer. It took positive note of the
reaffirmation of the right of the Iraqi people
to determine their political future as well as
the mandate to the Governing Council to
draw up a time table for the drafting of a
new constitution and holding of democratic
elections. Taking note of the appeal in the
resolution to UN Member States to assist in
reconstruction efforts, the Indian
Government reiterated its readiness to
contribute to the restoration of
infrastructure, medical, health, education,
communication and other civilian needs of
the Iraqi people.
In early 2004, developments in the UN with
regard to Iraq continued to be a major focus
of international attention. In February 2004,
in response to requests from the CPA and
the Iraqi Governing Council for UN
involvement in the transitional political
process in Iraq, the UN Secretary General
dispatched a fact-finding team led by
UNSGs Special Advisor, Lakhdar Brahimi,
to mainly establish whether elections for a
transitional national assembly could be held
before the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq on
30 June 2004, and if not, to explore possible
alternatives to take the political process
forward. The team concluded that while
elections were necessary, credible elections
could not be held before the end of 2004.
On 17 March 2004, in separate letters to
the UNSG, the Iraqi Governing Council and
CPA formally invited the UN to play a role
in forging a consensus on the setting up of
the interim government and providing
assistance in ensuring the conduct of direct
elections by January 2005. Subsequently, in
response, UNSG, with the support of the
Security Council dispatched a team led by
LakhdarBrahimi to Iraq in early April.
The UN has been engaged in Iraq in a
tentative way and it remains to be seen
whether this would eventually lead to greater
involvement and a more substantive role for
the UN in Iraq. It is as yet unclear what role
!

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

the UN would be able to play in Iraq with
regard to transfer of sovereignty,
endorsement of the interim government and
constitution, the provision of security in
terms of setting up of a Multinational Force
and in the situation post 30 June 2004. In
end March, there was also considerable
speculation about the necessity of a new
resolution of the UN Security Council to
address these issues.
Afghanistan
An issue of critical importance that
continued to attract a lively debate pertained
to strengthening the triangular relationship
between the Security Council, the
Secretariat and the Troop Contributing
Countries (TCCs). India has played a lead
role all along in this debate, which saw the
passing of Resolution 1353, and a Note by
the President of the Council dated 14
January 2003, envisaging a new mechanism
of cooperation and Joint Meetings between
the Working Group of the Security Council
on PKOs and TCCs. India participated in
the open debate held in the Security Council
on the situation in Afghanistan on 17 June
2003 to take into account the views of the
larger membership, especially on the issue
of drugs and its implications on the political
process and reconstruction efforts. While
highlighting the serious challenge posed to
the peace process by drugs and the
deteriorating security situation and the need
to address them firmly and resolutely, India
reiterated its support to international efforts
aimed at reconstruction and emergence of
Afghanistan as a peaceful, strong,
prosperous, united and independent nation.
In the backdrop of increasing concern over
the challenges being mounted against the
Government of Afghanistan and the process
of stabilization and reconstruction, India, at
the High level ad-hoc meeting on
Afghanistan held on the margins of the UN
General Assembly on 24 September 2003,
reiterated its strong support to the Afghan
Government and its people, to re-establish
a strong, independent, sovereign and united
Afghanistan, including through bilateral
assistance and contribution.
The Security Council unanimously approved
"

resolution 1510 on 13 October 2003,
extending the mandate of the International
Security Assistance Force for 12 months and
authorizing expansion of its mandate to
allow it to support the Afghan Transitional
Authority and its successors, in the
maintenance of security in the areas of
Afghanistan outside Kabul.
The Security Council welcomed, as a very
significant step, the new Constitution agreed
by Afghanistans Loya Jirga on 4 January
2004. UN Secretary General hailed the
historic achievement as evidence of the
determination of the Afghan people to
establish a stable and democratic State. As
regards the holding of elections in
Afghanistan in June 2004 as originally
envisaged in the Bonn Accords, the UN has
expressed doubts about the possibility of
adhering to the Bonn schedule, in view of
the slow pace of voter registration, mainly
due to continuing insecurity. Efforts are being
made to impart added momentum to the
voter registration process so that elections
can be held as soon as possible.
Mr. Jean Arnault of France has been
appointed as the Special Representative of
the Secretary General for Afghanistan, in
place of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, who has been
appointed as the Special Adviser to the
Secretary General.

To review the progress made since the
Bonn Conference and to assess the
current situation in Afghanistan, a
major International Conference was
convened in Berlin, under the UN on
31 March and 1 April 2004. India
participated in this Conference and
Foreign Secretary Shri Shashank led
the Indian delegation. While
expressing its concern over the recent
surge in incidents of violence and
terrorist attacks threatening peace and
security in Afghanistan, India
reiterated its support and commitment
towards the reconstruction and
development of Afghanistan. India
renewed its financial commitments for
Afghanistan’s
reconstruction,

amounting to around US $ 400 million.
India also signed the Berlin
Declaration, which emphasizes the
commitment of the international
community
towards
the
reconstruction, development and
maintenance of peace and security in
Afghanistan.

The UN witnessed a contentious debate on
a number of issues related to the situation
in the Middle East.
The Tenth Emergency Special Session of the
General Assembly on the situation in
occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the
Occupied Palestinian Territory was reconvened on three separate occasions, on 19
September, 20-21 October and 8 December
2003. At the meeting of 19 September 2003,
a resolution demanding that Israel desist
from any act of deportation and cease any
threat to the safety of the elected President
of the Palestinian Authority was adopted.
India voted in favour of the resolution.
At the meeting held on 20 October 2003, a
resolution was adopted demanding that
Israel stop and reverse construction of the
Security Wall in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, including in and around Jerusalem.
The resolution requested the Secretary
General to report periodically on
compliance with the resolution, with the first
report on compliance with the demand to
cease construction on the wall presented
within one month. India voted in favour of
the resolution. The meeting on 8 December
2003 was held in the backdrop of Secretary
Generals report that Israel was not in
compliance with the General Assemblys
demand that Israel stop and reverse
construction of the wall in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory. At this meeting, a
resolution seeking advisory opinion from the
International Court of Justice on the legal
consequences arising from the construction
of the wall was adopted. India voted in
favour of the resolution.
The Security Council unanimously adopted
Resolution 1515 on 19 November 2003,
which for the first time endorsed the Quartet

United Nations and International Organisations

Road Map and called on the parties to fulfill
their obligations under the Road Map in
cooperation with the Quartet, for achieving
the vision of two States living side by side in
peace and security.
African Issues
The Security Council remained seized of
several issues relating to the African
continent including conflicts in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote
dIvoire, Liberia, Western Sahara, Sierra
Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Council
authorized new peacekeeping missions in
Liberia and Cote dIvoire and approved
extension in the mandates of the other
existing missions in the African continent.
It also expressed support for regional and
sub-regional efforts to bring peace to the
areas of conflict.
Terrorism
On the important issue of the threats
to international peace and security
caused by terrorist acts, India
participated in three open meetings of
the Security Council, which were held
on 4 April, 29 July and 16 October
2003. While reiterating that terrorism
was a common foe to all peoples,
beliefs and religions as also of
democracy, pluralistic societies and
peace, India pointed out that the
terrorist goal of disrupting normal
peaceful functioning of societies
including by launching attacks upon
places of worship, parliamentary
institutions, candidates and voters
engaged in democratic electoral
processes were tactics employed by
externally sponsored terrorists to
achieve their political objectives. India
underscored the point that the fight
against terrorism could be addressed
effectively only when all nations,
including those that saw a vested
interest in encouraging such
tendencies, realized that terrorism
was a malaise that could strike at will
in any part of the world.

In various Joint Working Groups on
Terrorism with other countries, India

continued to emphasize that terrorism was
a global phenomenon and the fight against
terrorism had to be comprehensive and
sustained. There could be no double
standards in combating terrorism. It could
not
be
ad-hoc,
selective
or
compartmentalized in terms of regions,
religions or organizations and there could
be no justification for terrorism: religious,
political, ideological or any other.
The Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC)
established pursuant to Security Council
Resolution 1373 followed an active
programme of implementation, involving
appropriate legislative framework and
measures to check financial flows to
terrorists. India continued to interact with
the CTC. India submitted its third report to
the Committee detailing legislative and other
counter-measures in place against terrorist
activities. During the interactions with the
CTC India emphasized that while it attached
importance to the work of the Committee,
it also felt that the CTC should be clear
about its objective of ensuring stricter
compliance, rather than mere collection of
information. India stressed that the CTC
should become more effective and purposive,
and needed to go beyond the process of mere
reporting, to a more serious examination of
the actual actions taken by States in their
international counter-terrorism effort.
The Security Council on 17 January 2003
adopted Resolution 1455 to improve the
implementation of measures imposed under
Security Council Resolutions 1267, 1333
and 1390 against Osama bin Laden, AlQaeda, the Taliban and associated entities.
India was among the States that submitted
their reports to the Al-Qaeda/Taliban
Sanctions Committee within the specified
time.

Peacekeeping
India continued to be a major troop
contributor. It is presently contributing
to 11 of the 15 UN peacekeeping
operations, providing Infantr y
Battalions to two of them [UN Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and UN

Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
(UNMEE)], helicopters with support
crew to the UN Organization Mission
in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(MONUC) and a major civilian police
component in the UN Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK). India has also committed,
in principle, to contribute to the
envisaged UN Peacekeeping Mission
in Sudan aimed at facilitating an end
to the long-running civil war in Sudan.

The annual session of the Special
Committee on Peacekeeping Operations was
held in March 2003. Apart from a discussion
on the more well-entrenched concepts in
peacekeeping such as strengthening
cooperation between the troop-contributing
countries and the Security Council, rapid
deployment, operational planning and
integrated mission task forces, the new issues
that came to the fore were disarmament,
demobilisation and re-integration [DDR] of
armed groups, Rule of Law issues, Conduct
and Discipline of peacekeepers, the problem
of HIV/AIDS, Children and Peacekeeping
and issues relating to Peacekeeping
Oversight. The concept of robust
peacekeeping was broached by the
Secretariat. It was emphasised that while
consent was still the basic principle under
which the UN operated, for a mission to
succeed in the changed realities of today, an
understanding was required on the need for
a robust force, deployed and configured not
only to be able to use force but to keep the
initiative and, if challenged, to defend itself
and the mandate. Such an escalation
capability was essential to project credibility.
This debate is expected to be taken forward
during the discussions on peacekeeping in
2004.
The Centre for UN Peacekeeping (CUNPK),
established by the Government of India
under the aegis of the United Service
Institution of India (USI), with the aim of
meeting part of the UN related training
requirements and promoting comprehensive
exchange and research has been actively
engaged in building a data base on
peacekeeping, organising national and
#

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

international Seminars and training capsules
for various segments, with participation of
nominees from foreign countries. The
Government of India is funding some of the
nominees from developing countries. Apart
from the annual calendar of training events
and Seminars this year, a Peacekeeping
Command Post Exercise (CPX) was hosted
jointly by India and US under the aegis of
CUNPK in February. 115 foreign nationals
from 16 countries and 35 Indian officers
participated in the exercise. In October this
year, India also co-hosted with the UN, a
training course for Military Observers and
Civilian Police from emerging troopcontributing countries at the CUNPK.
In his keynote address at the inaugural
session of the National Seminar at the
CUNPK on 21 August 2003, the
Foreign Secretary emphasized that
while India viewed peacekeeping in
the traditional sense as a classical UN
peacekeeping operation to assist in
‘keeping peace’ between two
conflicting States on their request,
India was fully alive to the reality of
the changing nature of peacekeeping
and the growing complexity and scale
of these operations. India was
sensitive to the fact that the UN was
increasingly involved in complex intraState conflicts, and UN operations had
widened from ‘peace keeping’ to
‘peace enforcement’, ‘peace building’
and management of ‘post conflict’
situations leading to an increasingly
large spectrum of activities. India has
also noted that there are varying
mandates under which these
operations are being undertaken.
India’s policy on involvement in
peacekeeping operations continued to
be shaped by a commitment to the UN
and its ideals. Within this framework,
our response for assistance is based
on an assessment of India’s overall
national interest, taking into account
several considerations such as
bilateral relations, regional equations,
public sentiments, operational aspects
and our international profile.

$

India has a bilateral dialogue on
peacekeeping issues with the US and UK.
Three India-UK Peacekeeping Seminars
have been held so far. The third Seminar was
held in Shrivenham, UK from 13-16
October 2003. The objective of these
seminars, in the nature of a Joint Working
Group, is to develop a better understanding
of each others perspectives on different
aspects of both conceptual and operational
dimensions of peacekeeping. It is also a
forum to exchange views on new
developments and emerging challenges in
the domain of peacekeeping.
Four meetings of the India-US Joint Working
Group on peacekeeping have so far taken
place. The fourth meeting was held recently
in Washington DC on 1 October 2003. The
JWG is not only a forum for exchanging
views on policy aspects and operational
issues, but also for planning joint activities
under CUNPK and identifying institutional
cooperation on peacekeeping.
Non-Aligned Movement
The XIII Conference of the Non-Aligned
Movement was held at Kuala Lumpur from
20-25 February 2003. Prime Minister Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayee led the Indian
delegation to the Summit. The theme of the
Summit was the continuing revitalization of
NAM. In the Conference, India stressed that
the Non-Aligned Movement needs to focus
on a priority agenda of global themes of
contemporary relevance that unites the
membership rather than divides it. NAM
should adopt a positive and forward looking
agenda with emphasis on
n multilateralism,
n reform of the UN system,
n North-South engagement,
n South-South cooperation,
n democracy
n multi-culturalism.

India insisted that the approach and tone of
NAM has to be pragmatic. The objective
should be to position NAM as a major pole
in the multi-polar world. Prime Minister Shri
Atal Bihari Vajpayees address and External
Affairs Minister, Shri Yashwant Sinhas

presentation underlined these aspects. The
Conference adopted the Kuala Lumpur
Declaration, which reflects many of Indias
ideas, and proposals.
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
participated actively in the Open Meeting
of the Security Council on Iraq, convened
on 26-27 March 2003. Condemning the
unilateral military action in Iraq as a
violation of the principles of international
law and the UN Charter, NAM asked for an
immediate halt to the war. Reiterating its
commitment to multilateralism and the
fundamental principles of the non-use of
force and respect for the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political
independence of all States, NAM urged for
a speedy and peaceful resolution of the issue
through the UN.
The Ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned
Movement was held on the margins of the
General Assembly on 26 September 2003.
In his statement, the External Affairs
Minister underlined the need for a collective
approach through multilateral institutions in
tackling issues of international peace and
security and the UNs central and critical role
in the same. He also expressed agreement
with UN Secretary General that a
comprehensive reform and restructuring of
the UN system including the Security
Council was an urgent imperative. He
reiterated that the menace of terrorism could
not be justified on the basis of political,
territorial, or ideological arguments.
The NAM Committee on Palestine, of which
India is a member, also met at Ministerial
level on the sidelines of the 58th session of
the General Assembly in New York in
September. In keeping with its mandate, the
Committee continued to explore measures
to further support the rights of the
Palestinian people in accordance with
international law and the will of the
Movement. The Committee also continued
to work with all the parties concerned for
the achievement of a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East that
would enable the Palestinian people to
exercise their rights in freedom and
sovereignty in their independent homeland.

United Nations and International Organisations

In continuation of the constructive role
India played in the XIII NAM Summit
in Kuala Lumpur in February 2003,
India continued to emphasize in
relevant forums that if NAM is to be
revitalized, it should adopt a
contemporary and forward-looking
approach, focusing on key issues of
common concern - issues that unite
rather than divide the 116 member
countries. India continued to stress
that NAM’s objective should be to
position itself as a major pole in a
multipolar world and to emerge as a
collective, pragmatic and serious
voice of the South.

The International Conference of
New or Restored Democracies
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri
Vinod Khanna led the Indian delegation to
the 5th International Conference for New or
Restored Democracies. The Conference
adopted Ulaanbaatar Declaration and Plan
of Action on Democracy, Good Governance
and Civil Society. This was yet another step
signifying Indias commitment to
strengthening the process of democratisation
worldwide. In his address, Shri Vinod
Khanna, while citing the unique example of
India as a successful democracy, spoke of the
need for strengthening the process of
democratic governance and institution
building; empowerment of women and the
weaker sections by consolidating selfgovernment at the grass roots level. He also
urged a concerted approach to tackle the
global menace of terrorism that threatened
the foundations of democratic societies
everywhere. On the Chairmans invitation,
India accepted membership of the fifteenmember group of Friends of the Chairman,
which has been entrusted to ensure an
effective follow-up of the Conference.

The International Conference
of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent
India participated in the 28th International
Conference of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent held in Geneva from 2-6 December

2003. The Conference discussed the
contemporary challenges posed to the
concepts and notions of war and peace,
International Humanitarian Law (IHL), the
nature of humanitarian activities during
conflict, the role of the Red Cross etc.,
particularly in the wake of recent attacks on
the ICRC in Iraq and Afghanistan. There
was an acceptance in the Conference that
many of these concepts needed a review.
Information activities
The Committee on Information which
makes recommendations to the General
Assembly on the policy and activities of the
Department of Public Information (DPI)
held its annual session in April-May 2003.
The Department of Information had been
heavily criticized by the developed countries,
which in the 1990s had sought to close it
down as part of the UN reform exercise.
Having failed to do so, they continued to seek
to pare down its activities and reallocate
resources to other departments. Some of the
major issues dealt with in the Committee on
Information included the goal of achieving
a new information order, information
support to UN peacekeeping, a UN radio
broadcasting capacity, a more efficient UN
website, parity in all official languages in the
work of the UN and the work of the United
Nations Information Centres (UNICs).

Organisation, including the provisions on
implementation
issues
and
the
operationalisation of provisions relating to
the special and differential treatment of the
developing countries.
The Council also decided that the theme for
the substantive session in 2004 would be
Resource Mobilisation and Enabling
Environment for Poverty Eradication in the
Context of the Implementations of the
Programme of Action for the Least
Developed Countries for the Decade 20012010.

Environment and Sustainable
Development Issues

Economic and Social Issues

The Eleventh session of the Commission on
Sustainable Development was held in New
York from 20 April- 9 May 2003. This was
the first meeting of the Commission since
the World Summit on Sustainable
Development (WSSD) was held in
Johannesburg from 26 August - 4 September
2002. The Indian Delegation led by Minister
of Environment and Forests, Shri T.R. Baalu
emphasized the critical significance of the
means of implementation for the developing
countries, the importance of the future work
programme of the Commission covering all
major issues of Agenda 21 and the
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, and
the necessity to provide inter-governmental
guidance to partnerships in this area.

The Economic and Social Council
The substantive session of the Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) was held in
Geneva from 30 June-25 July 2003. The
theme of the high-level segment this year was
Promoting an integrated approach to rural
development in developing countries for
poverty eradication and sustainable
development. The Ministerial declaration
adopted at the conclusion of the high-level
dialogue recognised the need to make rural
development an integral part of national and
inter national development policies,
including response strategies of bilateral
donors and activities and programmes of the
UN system. It also stressed the importance
of ensuring full implementation of the Doha
Ministerial Declaration of the World Trade

India participated actively in the negotiations
related to the organization of the work of
the Commission and its multi-year
programme of work. After prolonged
negotiations, a cluster approach for the
multi-year programme of work was adopted.
It was agreed that issues on which the
international community had earlier decided
on targets would be given priority. The
Commission also agreed to a two-year
implementation cycle, the first year being a
review-year that would focus on developing
a broad understanding on the gaps and
constraints in the implementation process
through dialogue with a broad range of
stakeholders while maintaining the
intergover nmental character of the
Commission. The second year, called the
%

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

policy year, would take decisions on how to
overcome obstacles and constraints in the
implementation process.
A major achievement of the Commission on
Sustainable Development was the intergovernmental agreement on a set of criteria
and guidelines on partnerships. India worked
with other leading developing countries with
the Group of 77 as well as with other
delegations for the finalization of the
guidelines on partnerships.
Convention against Corruption
An Ad-hoc Inter-Governmental Committee
has been negotiating an International
Convention against Corruption in Vienna
with the intention to adopt a comprehensive
and multi-disciplinary instrument against
corruption. The Ad-hoc Committee derived
its mandate from a decision of the UN
General Assembly. The importance of the
Convention lies in its aim to provide an
international legal framework that is
facilitative in its attempt to return wealth
illegally acquired through corruption back
to the country of origin, while also providing
a preventive framework as well as
enforcement measures to guard and combat
against corruption. India actively
participated in the negotiating process and
chaired the Open Ended Expert Group that
laid down the terms of reference for
negotiations by the Ad-hoc Committee.
India provided a moderating voice in
the negotiating process to bridge the
developing versus developed
countries divide that surfaced during
the negotiations wherein the former
were requiring obligatory provisions in
the convention for the return of assets
generated through corruption and
parked in safe havens abroad and the
latter demanding obligatory provisions
for effective preventive measures and
good governance mechanisms in the
concer ned countr y. India also
focussed on the need for international
co-operation to combat trans-national
aspects of corruption including
transfer of funds and their repatriation
to countries of origin without political
pre-conditionalities.
&

The Ad-hoc Committee successfully
negotiated the conclusion of this instrument
in October 2003 in Vienna, which was
adopted by the UNGA in its 58th session in
October 2003. A three-day conference was
held in Merida, Mexico from 9-11
December 2003 for signing the Convention
against Corruption. The Indian delegation
to this conference was led by the then
Minister of State for Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions, Shri Harin Pathak,

Social, Human Rights and
Humanitarian Issues
Close coordination and interaction
continued to retain its high priority within
the domain of Indias interactions with the
various human rights organizations and
bodies within the UN system. The
Permanent Missions of India in Geneva and
New York played an active role in the
deliberations of the Commission for Human
Rights in Geneva as well as the Third
Committee in the United Nations General
Assembly in New York. Proceedings of the
related UN bodies such as the SubCommission for the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights, Working
Group on Minorities, Working Group on
Contemporary Forms of Slavery, Working
Group on Indigenous People, various treaty
bodies and special procedure entities, were
closely followed. An active and balancing
role was adopted in the multilateral fora for
discussions on all aspects of human rights.
As a party to various international covenants,
conventions and declarations on human
rights, India continued to claim a major
stakeholder role in this important global
deliberative process.
In keeping with its stature as the largest
democracy, Indias approach in these fora
was guided by its commitment to the rule of
law, the values of freedom, justice, pluralism
and tolerance and respect for human rights
as enshrined in its Constitution and
international human rights instruments. In
its statements, India projected the concerns
of, and challenges faced by developing
countries while reaffirming the principles of
universality and indivisibility of human
rights. It also called for depoliticisation of

human rights debates and reiterated its
conviction that national capacity building
and dialogue were the most effective means
of promoting human rights. India also
monitored closely developments relating to
standard setting in the field of human rights.
Indias participation in the 59th session of the
Commission on Human Rights held from
17 March - 25 April 2003 was marked by
proactive engagement on substantive issues
and facilitation of consensus on contentious
issues. India refrained from aligning itself
with any coalitions and its engagement with
delegations across the board was issue based.
India made statements under all major
agenda items, which were well received and
appreciated. India cosponsored a large
number of resolutions during the session and
participated in negotiations on all major
resolutions and other initiatives.
Foreign Secretary led the Indian delegation
to the 60th Session of the Commission on
Human Rights (CHR) in Geneva (15 March23 April 2004). He addressed the High Level
Segment of the Session on 18 March. In his
address, he highlighted the strength and
achievement of secular and pluralistic Indian
democracy as guarantor of human rights.
Foreign Secretary stressed that human rights
cannot be used as instruments of foreign
policy and commended the report of the
Acting High Commissioner for advocating
in his Report that the struggle against poverty
should remain at the forefront of the human
rights agenda. Mentioning that CHR owed
a special responsibility to recognize and
address the rights of the victims of terrorism,
he underlined the need to effectively fight
terrorism internationally without
compromising rule of law and human rights.
He underscored the need for national
capacity building in promoting and
protecting human rights and pointed out the
role of technical cooperation and advisory
services in this regard.
In keeping with its consistent position that
the human rights agenda cannot be used for
furthering narrow political and foreign policy
objectives, India firmly rejected and exposed
Pakistans attempts to use the Commission
for its anti-India propaganda at the Sessions.

United Nations and International Organisations

India also strongly refuted Pakistans
allegations and referred to its own record in
democracy and human rights.
Indias second periodic report on the
Convention on the Rights of the Child was
considered by the UN Committee on the
Rights of the Child at its session in January
2004. The 8 th Annual Meeting of Asia
Pacific Forum of National Human Rights
Institutions (APF) was held in Kathmandu
from 16-18 February 2004. National human
rights institutions from twelve countries,
which are members of APF, attended the
Meeting including NHRC from India.
Government of India was represented by the
Ministry of External Affairs.
India’s re-election to the Commission
on Human Rights for the period 20042006 was a vindication of its longstanding and multifaceted contribution
to human rights within the UN system.
India will discharge its responsibilities
in this body during its next term with
seriousness and sense of purpose.

Within the domain of discussions on
alternative approaches for improving the
enjoyment of human rights, a wide number
of issues such as human rights and terrorism,
human rights and democracy, elimination of
all forms of religious intolerance, right to
development, human rights education,
human rights and responsibilities were
carefully monitored so as to keep the process
balanced and rational from the perspective
of developing countries.
India participated actively in the second
meeting of the Adhoc Committee on a
Comprehensive and Integral International
Convention on Promotion and Protection of
the Rights and Dignity of Persons with
Disabilities held in June, 2003 and was
chosen as a member of the Working Group
of the Adhoc Committee set up to elaborate
on a legal instrument.
A number of eminent Indians continued to
serve with distinction as members of
important Treaty Monitoring Bodies and
human rights mechanisms. These include
Shri P.N. Bhagwati (Member of the Human
Rights Committee), Mrs. Chokila Iyer

(Member, Committee on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights), Shri Arjun Sengupta
(Independent expert on the Right to
Development and for mer member of
Planning Commission), Shri R.V. Pillai
(Member of the Committee on Elimination
of Racial Discrimination), Shri Miloon
Kothari (Special Rapporteur on the Right
to Adequate Housing) and Mr. Soli Sorabjee
(Expert member in the Sub-Commission on
the Promotion and Protection of Human
Rights).

Health
A one-day meeting on Global Polio
eradication Initiative was organized by the
WHO in Geneva on 15 January 2004 where
The Geneva Declaration for the Eradication
of Polio was signed by six countries including
India and by the donors. The 113th session
of the Executive Board of the WHO was
held in Geneva from 19-23 January 2004.
Though India is not a member of the
Executive Board of the WHO, a delegation
led by DGHC Dr. S. P. Agrawal visited
Geneva to take part in the meeting.

Refugees and Humanitarian
Affairs
India took part in the meetings of the
Standing Committee and various informal
consultations of the UNHCR. It also
participated in the annual 54th Session of the
Executive Committee of the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees in SeptemberOctober 2003. India
highlighted its historical commitment to
humanitarian traditions of refugee hosting,
asylum and protection since independence.
In its interactions with the UNHCR, India
articulated issues of particular concern to
developing countries which host the bulk of
refugees today such as the need to address
the phenomenon of massive and mixed
refugee flows, international burden sharing
and responsibility in the context of abject
poverty and deprivation around the globe,
enhancement of the capacities of developing
countries and the link between humanitarian
assistance and long-term development as key
inputs for preventive strategies for refugee
protection. India also reiterated its consistent

position that durable solutions can only be
based on the consent of concerned member
states, and therefore, where bilateral
processes are underway, these should be
given their full chance to succeed.

Specialised Bodies
Operational activities of the UN
development system
India continued to play an important role
in the work of the UN funds and
programmes. India resumed its membership
of the executive boards of the UN
Development Programme [UNDP]/UN
Fund for Population Activities [UNFPA] in
2003. India was also a member of the
executive board of the UN International
Childrens Fund [UNICEF]. In the
deliberations of these bodies, Indias efforts
were to underscore the primacy of countrydriven programming, in accordance with
national development plans and priorities.
UNESCO
The Government of India in association
with UNESCO organized an International
Ministerial Conference on Dialogue among
Civilisations  Quest for New Perspectives
in New Delhi from 9-10 July 2003. The
Prime Minister of India inaugurated the
Conference on 9 July 2003. Dr. Murli
Manohar Joshi, Minister for Human
Resource Development and Director
General of UNESCO Dr. Koichiro
Matsuura addressed the inaugural session.
The Conference was attended by around 80
national delegations, 25 special invitees
drawn from eminent scientists, social
scientists including Nobel laureates and
leaders from the world of culture and
education. The Conference sought to
emphasize the importance of global dialogue
and the impact it can have on the promotion
of tolerance, respect for pluralism and
diversity as components of development and
human advancement .The Conference
ended with the adoption of the New Delhi
Declaration by consensus.
The Declaration recognizes that tolerance
is a fundamental value that is common to all
civilizations and this includes respect for
others. It underlines the importance of
'

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

crucial role that education can play in
promoting understanding between different
civilizations. Education, the Declaration
further states is necessary to develop
communities and societies rooted in
principles of democracy, justice and respect
for human rights. The New Delhi
Declaration urges governments to take full
and effective measures to ensure that
educational institutions are protected from
teachings that promote extremism,
intolerance and violence. A very significant
aspect of the Declaration is the reaffirmation
that all acts of terrorism represent attack
against humanity, as the killing of innocent
civilians in order to spread terror is
despicable to the values of all civilizations.
The Delhi Declaration also gives importance
to science as a powerful source of social and
economic transformation and the role of
infor mation
and
communication
technologies in enhancing inter-cultural
communication leading to greater
understanding between civilizations. The
Executive Board of UNESCO later
endorsed the New Delhi Declaration
adopted at this Conference.
UNEP
UNEP is an important UN programme
dealing with environmental issues. The 22nd
session of the Governing Council (GC)/
Global Ministerial Environmental Forum

United Nations and International Organisations

Group of 77
The Annual meeting of the Ministers of
Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 was held
on 25 September 2003 in New York. This
was preceded by a meeting of senior officials
on 24 September 2003. Foreign Ministers
of Mauritius, Nepal, Indonesia, Costa Rica,
Iran, Benin, Malawi, Thailand and China
attended the meeting. In his statement, the
External Affairs Minister outlined the
difficulties faced by the developing countries
in the current global economic situation and
stressed the importance of achieving greater
equity in international economic relations
and ensuring a greater voice for developing
countries in the decision-making structures
in international trade, monetary and
financial institutions. While expressing
disappointment that the Fifth Ministerial
Meeting at Cancun failed to produce an
agreement that would have addressed the
interests and concer ns of developing
countries, he emphasized the need for
developing countries to retain their unity of
purpose and solidarity as demonstrated at
Cancun. He also emphasized the need to
strengthen UNCTAD and enhance its
capacity to assist developing countries and
enable it to play an important role in
integrating the development dimension into
the international legal framework and rules
on trade. The Ministerial meeting elected
Qatar as the Chairman of the Group of 77
for the year 2004 and admitted Timor Leste
as the 135 th member of the G-77. The
meeting adopted a Ministerial Declaration.
The meeting of the Heads of State/
Government of the member countries of the
Group of 77 (G-77), who met in Cuba in
April 2000 on the occasion of the first-ever
South-South Summit, decided to convene a
conference on South-South Cooperation in
the year 2003. As the Chair of G-77,
Morocco hosted this meeting entitled the
High-Level Conference on South-South
Cooperation in Marrakesh from 16-19
December 2003. India was represented by a
delegation led by Shri Rajiv Sikri, Special
Secretary (ER) in the Ministry of External
Affairs.
The meeting in Marrakesh was of particular

significance to India, given the importance
India attaches to South-South cooperation
and the proactive role that it plays in this
area. The meeting took stock of the progress
on the Havana Programme of Action which
issued from the Havana Summit and which
laid down the practical roadmap for SouthSouth cooperation. India has been proactive
both bilaterally and through regional
groupings and its record of implementation
is notable. Besides this, India is also at this
moment, on the threshold of a major policy
initiative in terms of its programme of
development aid to other countries in the
South.
Visit of Deputy Secretary-General to
India
Ms. Louise Frechette, the first person to hold
the office of Deputy Secretary-General of
the United Nations since the post was
established in 1997, paid an official visit to
India from 25-30 January 2004. On behalf
of the UN, Ms. Frechette delivered the
keynote address at the 6th Asian Security
Conference on the theme International
Security, Multilateralism and the United
Nations organized by the Institute for
Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). She
also had meetings with leaders, senior
officials and the heads of the UN agencies
in India.

Disarmament
Indias commitment to non-discriminatory
and universal nuclear disarmament and the
global elimination of all Weapons of Mass
Destruction continued to be reflected in its
policy pronouncements and diplomatic
initiatives. The countrys stand on issues
related to disarmament and international
security in various multilateral and regional
forums was premised on Indias national
security interests and its tradition of close
engagement with the international
community to promote cooperative efforts
at addressing these challenges.
Bilateral dialogues with key countries
commenced after May 1998 continued to be
pursued this year. Harmonisation of Indias
national imperatives and security obligations

with inter national concerns on nonproliferation and disar mament also
progressed steadily. On the regional level,
Indias participation in the confidence and
security building process and structure under
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) acquired
greater momentum. India also participated
in the meetings of Conference on Interaction
and Confidence Building Measures in Asia
(CICA) during the year.
Regular contact was maintained with key
international and non-governmental
organisation active in the field of
disarmament with a view to disseminating
the Indian perspectives on disarmament
issues. Enquiries from Members of
Parliament on all relevant developments
were also responded to and due information
brought to the attention of the Parliament.
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
India took part in the work of the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) through participation
in the various meetings organised under the
aegis of the ARF, including the first InterSessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism
and Transnational Crimes (ISM on CT-TC)
held in Sabah, Malaysia on 30-31 March
2003, the ARF Senior Officials Meeting
held in Phnom Penh in April 2003 which
took stock of the developments and prepared
for the ARF Ministerial Meeting in June;
Workshop on Consequence Management
organized by Australia and Singapore from
3-5 May 2003 in Darwin, Australia and the
Inter-sessional Support Group Meeting on
Confidence Building Measures (ISG on
CBMs) held in Beijing from 20-22 November
2003.
The 10th ARF Ministerial meeting was held
in Phnom Penh on 17-18 June 2003. The
External Affairs Minister led the Indian
delegation. The issue of terrorism and
terrorist threat to the region as a whole
continued to dominate the ARF agenda.
The Ministers deliberated on ways and
means to increase practical cooperation
among member states in this respect and
adopted a Statement on Cooperative
Counter-Terrorist Actions on Border
Security as well as a Statement on



Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

Cooperation Against Piracy and Other
Threats to Maritime Security. The External
Affairs Minister in his intervention
emphasized the need for concerted fight
against global terrorism without any double
standards or equivocation and underlined
the potential risks in its linkages with WMD
proliferation.
India hosted the 7th Annual Meeting of the
ARF Heads of National Defence Colleges/
Institutions in New Delhi from 15-17
October 2003. Indias offer to host this
meeting had been endorsed by the ARF
Ministers at 10th ARF meeting. More than
40 participants from 18 ARF member states
attended the meeting, and were highly
appreciative of the presentations made and
the organisation as well as the content of
the Annual Meeting.
United Nations General Assembly
(UNGA)
India continued to play an active role on
disarmament issues in the First Committee
of the UN General Assembly. At the 58th
Session of the First Committee, in
recognition of the widely shared concern of
the international community about the
heightened dangers posed by the risk of
terrorists getting access to weapons of mass
destruction, Indias resolution on Measures
to Prevent Terrorists from Acquiring
Weapons of Mass Destruction, was adopted
once again unanimously. India had first
tabled this resolution at the 57th Session of
the UNGA.
India reiterated commitment to its principled
stand on global nuclear disarmament based
on the firm conviction that progressively
lower levels of armaments globally and
imaginative control over them will guarantee
undiminished security for all. Indias
Resolution on Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons
which was first introduced in 1982, calls
upon the Conference on Disarmament to
commence negotiations on an international
convention prohibiting the use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons under any
circumstances, as a first step towards
reducing the salience of nuclear weapons.


India’s Resolution on “Reducing
Nuclear Danger”, first introduced in
1998, calls for the review of nuclear
doctrines and immediate and urgent
steps to reduce the risk of
unintentional and accidental use of
nuclear weapons.

Indias resolution Role of Science and
Technology in the Context of International
Security and Disarmament, highlighted the
qualitative aspects of the arms race, and the
need for a genuinely multilateral and nondiscriminatory response. India has
maintained that technology denial to
responsible States does not serve the
objectives of non-proliferation but only
signals a punitive intent. All these resolutions
were adopted by a good majority as in
previous years.
Conference on Disarmament (CD)
The Conference on Disarmament, the sole
multilateral disarmament treaty negotiating
body, held three sessions during 2003 at
Geneva on 20 January - 28 March, 12 May27 June and 28 July-10 September. India
held the rotational Presidency of the CD
during the first four weeks of the First Session
this year. India assumed the Presidency of
the Conference on Disarmament from 1
January to 14 February 2003 on the basis of
rotation among the 66 members of the CD.
The last time India had held the Presidency
of CD was in 1994. On this occasion, the
then Foreign Secretary Shri Kanwal Sibal
addressed the plenary meeting of the CD
on 23 January 2003. In his statement, he
focussed on the dimension of international
terrorism as a threat to global security and
highlighted the linkages between terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction. He
reiterated Indias commitment to
negotiations on nuclear disar mament,
including Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty
and for prevention of an arms race in outer
space. India also underlined its support to
the cross-group initiative of the five
ambassadors, made in 2002 for removing the
existing deadlock on the programme of
work.

India also actively participated in the
deliberations on various proposals to end the
impasse in the CD over adoption of a
Programme of Work. (The CD has been
unable to adopt a Programme of Work since
1999 due to the lack of consensus on the
mandates for various Ad-hoc Groups to be
set up on various agenda items.)
United Nations Disarmament
Commission (UNDC)
The Substantive Session of the UNDC in
2003 was held from 31 March- 17 April 2003
in New York. The UNDC had commenced
consideration in 2000, as part of a three year
cycle, of two subjects: (a) ways and means to
achieve nuclear disar mament and (b)
practical confidence building measures in the
field of conventional arms. The 2003 Session
was devoted to consideration of these two
subjects. India participated actively in the
deliberations on both the subjects. The
session however, failed to reach consensus on
substantive recommendations on either of
the two subjects and adopted a procedural
report containing annexes of documents on
nuclear disar mament and confidence
building measures.
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA)
The 47th Session of General Conference of
the IAEA was held from 16-20 September
2003. The Indian delegation was led by Dr.
Anil Kakodkar, Chairman, Atomic Energy
Commission. As in the past few years, the
most important issues were the resolutions
on strengthening of safeguards and that
relating to transport safety. Under the
Chairmanship of the Indian Ambassador,
the resolution on transport safety obtained
consensus in record time. India also
endeavored to maintain a balanced approach
in the General Conference resolution on
safeguards for all the Member States of the
Agency without discrimination.
An international conference on Innovative
Technologies for Nuclear Fuel Cycles and
Nuclear Power was held by IAEA in endJune 2003 in which a high-level delegation
from India, including Dr. R. Chidambaram,
Principal Scientific Advisor and several other

United Nations and International Organisations

scientists participated. India contributed to
IAEAs efforts to locate and secure orphaned
radioactive sources and towards concluding
an International Code of Conduct on
Radioactive Sources.
Chemical Weapons Convention
India continued to play an active role at the
Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at The Hague
during the year. India is an original State
Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC). India played a key role at the
successful First Review Conference of the
States Parties to the CWC at The Hague (28
April  9 May 2003) and made substantial
contributions towards the finalization of
both the Political Declaration and the Final
Report of the Review of the Operation of
the CWC by the Review Conference.
India effectively engaged in the deliberations
and decision-making during the Eighth
Conference of States Parties from 20-24
October 2003 and highlighted all issues of
concern to us and to other developing
countries.
India continued to fulfil all its commitments
under the Convention. Having declared
possession of chemical weapons to the
OPCW in 1997, Indias destruction efforts,
under OPCW inspection, have been
proceeding according to the destruction
timelines established in the Convention, with
the OPCW having duly taken note of the
destruction plans. During the year, India
received inspections from the Technical
Secretariat of OPCW at different facilities
and these have been conducted in a smooth
manner.
Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention
The Resumed Session of the Fifth Review
Conference of the States Parties to the
Biological (Bacteriological) and Toxin
Weapons Convention (BWC) in November
2002 had decided to hold three Annual
Meetings of the States Parties of one week
duration each in 2003, 2004 and 2005,
leading up to the Sixth Review Conference
to be held not later than the end of 2006. It
had also decided that each Annual Meeting
was to be prepared by a two week Meeting

of Experts. The First Annual Meeting of
States Parties to the BWC was held at
Geneva on 10-14 November 2003 to discuss
and promote common understanding and
effective action on (i) the adoption of
necessary national measures to implement
the prohibitions set forth in the Convention,
including the enactment of penal legislation;
and (ii) national mechanisms to establish and
maintain the security and oversight of
pathogenic micro organisms and toxins.
It was prepared by a Meeting of Experts in
Geneva from 18-29 August 2003. India
participated in the deliberations at both the
Meeting of Experts and the Meeting of the
States Parties. India reiterated its firm
commitment to implement the provisions of
the BWC and to combat bio-terrorism and
informed the participants about the national
measures adopted by it to implement the
prohibitions set forth in the Convention,
including the enactment of penal legislation
and legislative and other mechanisms to
establish and maintain the security and
oversight of pathogenic micro organisms and
toxins.
Convention on Certain Conventional
Weapons
India is a High Contracting Party to the
Convention on Prohibitions Or Restrictions
on the Use of Certain Conventional
Weapons Which may be Deemed to be
Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects (CCW) and has
ratified all its protocols including the
Amended Protocol II on prohibitions or
restrictions on the use of Mines, booby traps
and other devises. India chaired the Meeting
of the States Parties to the Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW),
which was held in Geneva from 27-28
November 2003. The meeting adopted by
consensus a new Protocol on Explosive
Remnants of War (ERW), which would be
annexed to the Convention on CCW as
Protocol V. As Chairman, India played a
crucial role in developing consensus on a
draft Protocol and Indias role was
appreciated by the States Parties.
The Annual Meeting of the States Parties
to the Amended Protocol II to the

Convention on CCW on prohibitions or
restrictions on the use of mines, booby traps
and other devises was also held at Geneva
on 26 November 2003. India informed the
Meeting about the steps taken by it to
implement the provisions of Amended
Protocol II and its commitment to the vision
of a world free of landmines. India also
contributed to the efforts to review the
continuing operation and further
development of the UN Register of
Conventional Arms. The scope of the
Register was expanded to include ManPortable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS).
Small Arms and Light Weapons
India is acutely aware of the problem of
proliferation of and illicit trafficking in small
ar ms and remains committed to
participating actively in international search
for effective solutions, including the
implementation of the Programme of
Action (PoA) adopted at the UN Conference
on Illicit Trafficking in Small Arms and Light
Weapons in All Its Aspects, held in July 2001.
The first Biennial Meeting of the States to
consider the implementation of the UN
Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat
and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms
and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects at the
National, Regional and Global levels was
held in New York from 7-11 July, 2003. The
primary focus of this meeting was on the
implementation of the PoA by States at the
national level. The meeting also provided an
opportunity to take stock of the progress
achieved so far. India submitted a Report on
implementation of the UN Programme of
Action to the Biennial Conference and
appraised it of the comprehensive system of
regulatory policies and practices established
in India relating to small arms and light
weapons. India reiterated its commitment to
remain constructively engaged in the
international efforts to address the problem
of illicit trade in small arms and light
weapons.

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

General pursuant to the Resolution 56/24
V of the UN General Assembly. The Group
of Governmental Experts, in their Report
submitted to the UN Secretary General for
presentation to 58 th Session of the UN
General Assembly, recommended by
consensus that it was both desirable and
feasible to develop an international
instrument to enable States to identify and
address in a timely and reliable manner illicit
small arms and light weapons. Contribution
of India in chairing the Group was
appreciated by the UN Secretary General.
The 58th session of the General Assembly
has endorsed the recommendation of the
Group and the work on this issue is likely to
commence in the next year.

Outer Space Affairs
The 46th Session of the UN Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN
COPUOS) was held in Vienna from 11-20
June 2003. This session apart from a general
exchange of views on space matters, the
Committee deliberated on implementation
of recommendations of UNISPACE-III,
ways and means of maintaining outer space
for peaceful purposes, issues of space debris
and the international system for search and
rescue. The Committee saw a live
demonstration

Ministers of CICA scheduled for late 2004.

India-Brazil-South Africa
(IBSA) Dialogue Forum
At the invitation of the External Affairs
Minister, Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Mr.
Celso Amorim, and South Africa Dr.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma participated in
the First meeting of the Trilateral
Commission of the IBSA Dialogue Forum
held in New Delhi from 4-5 March 2004.
The IBSA Dialogue Forum was established
in June 2003, when the three Foreign
Ministers met in Brasilia and adopted the
Brasilia Declaration. The Brasilia
Declaration covers the entire range of issues
of concern in the bilateral and multilateral
context and, inter alia, provides for regular
political consultations on international
agenda items, exchange of information on
areas of mutual cooperation so as to
coordinate positions on issues of common
interest as well as establishment of a
Trilateral Commission. This First meeting
of the Trilateral Commission marked a
watershed in the evolution of IBSA Dialogue
Forum.
The three Foreign Ministers adopted
the New Delhi Agenda for Cooperation
and Plan of Action. The Agenda for
Cooperation provides for cooperation
and coordination among the three
countries in various multilateral forums
dealing with trade, economic, political,
social, environmental and security
issues with a view to highlight the
concerns of the developing countries.
The Ministers also reaffirmed the
commitment to work together in
various forums to ensure that
globalisation benefits developing
countries and becomes a positive
force for sustained economic growth.

The meeting emphasised that trilateral
cooperation among the three countries could
serve as an important tool for achieving the
promotion of social and economic
development. With this view, discussions for
promoting trilateral cooperation in various
sectors were also held. The sectors covered
include Health, S&T, IT, Civil Aviation and
Shipping Links, Tourism, Trade and
Investment, Infrastructure, Defence,
Education and Energy. The Plan of Action
adopted by Ministers details the specific
action points agreed upon for promoting
trilateral cooperation in these sectors in a
timely and focussed manner.
The three countries had earlier agreed to set
up an IBSA Funding Facility under UNDP
auspices for undertaking projects in other
developing countries for alleviation of
poverty and hunger. These projects would
be based on the best practices of India, Brazil
and South Africa. At the Trilateral
Commission meeting, the Guidelines for
Operationalising this Facility were also
approved by the Foreign Ministers. External
Affairs Minister also announced the decision
of the Government to make a financial
contribution of US$100,000 for the Facility.
The next meeting of the Trilateral
Commission will be held in South Africa in
the first quarter of 2005.

International Law and
Developments
Elections
India was elected to the Governing Council
of the UNIDROIT, an inter-governmental
organization in the field of private
international law. Indian candidate Mr.
Biswanth B. Sen, Senior Advocate, Supreme
Court of India was re-elected to the
Governing Council, securing 45 of 55 valid

Sixth (Legal) Committee of the UN
General Assembly
During the 55th General Assembly Session,
the Sixth Committee considered several
agenda items including the Establishment of

External Affairs Minister Shri Yashwant Sinha with Celso Amorim, Minister of External Relations, Brazil and Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma, Foreign
Minister, South Africa at the India-Brazil-South Africa Trilateral Meeting in Brasilia, June 6,2003

Annual Report (1 January 2003 – 31 March 2004)

the International Criminal Court, Report of
the Special Committee on the Charter of
the United Nations and the strengthening
the role of the Organisation; Measures to
Eliminate International Terrorism;
Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of
States and their Property and United Nations
Programme of Assistance in Teaching.
The Rome Statute for the establishment of
an International Criminal Court entered
into force on 1 July 2002 and the Court
started its work on 1 July 2002, at the Hague.
The election for judges of the Court was held
at the UN Headquarters, New York, from
3-7 February 2003. Eighteen Judges were
elected. In addition the Prosecutor of the
Court was also elected. A Working Group is
presently considering the elements of the
crime of aggression.
The Special Committee on the Charter of
the United Nations and on the
Strengthening of the Role of the
Organizations considered several proposals
relating to: maintenance of international
peace and security; peaceful settlement of
disputes between states; the Trusteeship
Council; coordination with other committees
etc. concerning the maintenance of
international peace and security, in
particular with regard to assistance to third
States adversely affected by sanctions. Indias
stand over the years has been that the
Security Council should hold the primary
responsibility towards the affected third
States, as a part of the sanctions imposing
decisions. The Council should establish a
Trust Fund for that purpose based on the
scale applicable to the peacekeeping
operations as well as the voluntary
contributions.
The Ad Hoc Committee and the Working
Group of the Sixth Committee on Terrorism
continued their consideration of the Draft
Comprehensive
Convention
on
International Terrorism proposed by India.
Discussions were mainly focused on the
outstanding issues especially on the exclusion
clause (Article 18) and on the definition of
offences (Article 2). The Committee decided
to continue its efforts to resolve the
outstanding issues through the Ad hoc
Committee during its meeting from 26 June
$

- 2 July 2004. A decision was also taken by
the Sixth Committee to continue the work
of the enlargement of the Scope of the
Convention on Safety of the United Nations
and Associated Personnel, including a
Protocol.
Having successfully adopted the draft
provisions on Jurisdictional Immunities of
States and their Property, the Sixth
Committee decided to reconvene an Ad Hoc
Committee to formulate a preamble and
final clauses with a view to completing a
Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of
States and their Property.
The Sixth Committee decided, after a vote,
that the item entitled International
Convention Against the Reproductive
Cloning of human Beings should be
included in the provisional agenda of the 60th
session of the General Assembly. The
decision was mainly aimed at avoiding a
decision on the Costa Rican proposal
cosponsored by more than 85 countries to
evolve a mandate for a convention to ban
all forms of cloning.
International Humanitarian Law
This Division participated in the 28 th
International Conference of the Red Cross
and Red Crescent, which adopted an agenda
for action for protecting human dignity in
the areas relating to the fate of missing in
situations of armed conflict and armed
violence, strengthening the protection of
civilians from indiscriminate used and effects
of weapons, minimizing the impact of
disaster through the implementation of
disaster risk reducing measures and reducing
the risk of impact of diseases like HIV/
AIDS.
Oceans and Law of the Sea
The work under this item in the UN General
Assembly aims to ensure sustainable
development of oceans, sustainable fisheries,
conservation and management of oceans,
ensuring maritime safety and protection of
marine ecosystems.
At the 55 th Session, the UN General
Assembly considered two draft resolutions,
which made recommendations that would
impact beneficially on both the safety of

navigation and the protection of marine
environment. Adopting the resolution
relating to sustainable fisheries, by consensus,
the world body called on all States to become
parties to the Convention, while reaffirming
the importance attached to the long-term
conservation, management and sustainable
use of the marine living resources of the
world oceans and seas. India acceded to this
Convention on 19th August 2003. It has been
decided to establish an Assistance Fund
under Part VII of the 1995 Fish Stocks
Agreement to assist developing countries in
the implementation of the Agreement. The
flag and port States have been urged to take
all measures consistent with international
law to prevent the operation of sub-standard
vessels and illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing activities.
In the draft resolution on Oceans and the
Law of the Sea, main focus is put on the
resource management and capacity building
matters, which remained a significant
impediment to the full implementation of
the Convention in many areas.
Indias statement on this agenda item has
highlighted for assistance to developing states
in acquiring knowledge and skills for the
preparation of claim submissions on the
outer limits of continental shelf beyond 200
nautical miles. India has expertise on the
assessment and mapping of the continental
shelf, and was willing to extend cooperation
in training developing countries for that
purpose. Further, we have expressed concern
with regard to the increase in incidence of
crimes at sea including acts of terrorism
against shipping, while recognizing the
importance of regional cooperation to
combat piracy.
Piracy
This Division participated in the
development of a Regional Cooperation
Agreement on the Prevention and
Suppression of Piracy and Armed Robbery
in Asia. The draft regional agreement has
been finalized. The important function of
the Agreement is to encourage cooperation
amongst the Contracting Parties in their
efforts to prevent and suppress piracy and

13. External Publicity

T

he Exter nal Publicity Division
continued to effectively project and
promote India and its viewpoint on various
issues of concern through its active
association with the Indian and international
media including dissemination of
information and publicity material through
Indian missions abroad. The division
assiduously worked to promote
understanding of the Governments policies,
the Ministrys role and Indias positive image
through regular press briefings, publications,
audio-visual media and its website which is
updated on a daily basis. Prime Ministers
peace initiative with Pakistan, his visits to
New York (UNGA), Russia, China, Central
Asia, South-East Asia, West Asia and the
Arab World, Indias stand on international
and cross-border terrorism, Middle East,
Iraq and WTO related issues were among
the main topics which found special focus
of our publicity efforts.
With intense media interest in developments
in Indo-Pak relations in the wake of Prime
Ministers offer extending Indias hand of
friendship to Pakistan in April 2003,
sustained effort was exerted to keep the
media abreast of latest happenings on this
front. Indias peace initiatives  Prime
Ministers Srinagar speech in April 2003, the
12-point proposal made in October 2003,
the announcement of ceasefire along LOC,
international border and Siachen in J&K by
both sides in November 2003, establishment
of communication links, the meetings
between the leadership of the two countries
on the sidelines of SAARC Summit in
Islamabad in January 2004, the meeting of
the Foreign Secretaries in February 2004 etc
 were given wide publicity. This was also
reflected in the coverage.
Indias excellent relations with major
countries of the world and the progress
achieved by India in the domains of
economy, S&T, IT, biotechnology etc. were
also highlighted. The success of this
approach was evident from the prominent
coverage received during PMs visits abroad
and Indias interaction with multilateral
organizations like UN, SAARC, ASEAN,
ARF and EU. The assistance provided by
India to Afghanistan was given wide

publicity. Indias stand on the Middle East
and Iraq issues was appreciated especially
in the Arab press.

Spokesperson’s Office
The Division took a proactive stance in
expounding Indias foreign policies through
regular and special media briefings by the
Spokesperson, press releases, statements and
backgrounders. Arranging media interviews
with the Prime Minister, External Affairs
Minister and other dignitaries, planning and
managing media campaigns and developing
strategies to convey Government of Indias
policies to the media and public, were among
the other important functions in this context.
The office also liaised with the press during
incoming and outgoing high-level visits and
managed to achieve good coverage for all
events in both Indian and international
media.
The Spokespersons office kept pace with the
numerous visits witnessed as a result of
Indias intense engagement with the
inter national
community.
The
Spokespersons office used the opportunities
provided by these visits to state Indias
positions on all issues. Around 210 press
releases and statements were issued and
more than 150 press briefings and media
interactions were held during the period.
These were circulated among the Indian and
international media and Indian missions. All
of them were also posted on the Ministrys
website in a timely manner.
A
new,
better
structured,
comprehensive and more secure
website of the Ministr y, http://
meaindia.nic.in, came into operation
in August 2003. The website is
updated on a real time basis
(frequently several times a day) with
latest press releases, br iefings,
statements, documents, repor ts,
Question-Answers in Parliament,
interviews and relevant articles and
op-ed pieces from Indian and
inter national press. In addition,
hyperlinks are provided to websites of
Indian missions, states, ministries and

reputed organizations. Audio-visual
material is also incorporated. The
weekly MEA Newswire covering
important developments of the week
continued to target intellectuals,
opinion-makers, think-tanks and Indiawatchers across the globe. The
Ministry of External Affairs website
proved to be a vital tool in
dissemination of information by the
Office of the Spokesperson and a
source of information related to India
and the Ministr y. It consistently
featured among the top 5 GOI
websites with document access of
over 75000 per day from both inside
and outside India.

Visits by Foreign Media
External Publicity Division in coordination
with Indian missions abroad facilitated the
visits of more than 75 foreign journalists to
India between January 2003 and March
2004. These familiarization visits by senior
jour nalists and editors from Austria,
Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Cambodia,
Czech Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Hungary, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia,
Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Russia, Senegal,
South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Hongkong,
Seychelles, Trinidad & Tobago etc. were
aimed at providing them a flair of modern
India through visits to important institutions
and cities and meetings with senior officials,
intellectuals, academicians, businessmen etc.
The visits had the desired effect and led to
increased positive coverage of India and its
achievements in reputed foreign journals.

Media Facilitation
An important role of the External Publicity
Division is to provide logistical and liaison
support to foreign media accompanying
Heads of State/Government visiting India
and Indian media delegations accompanying
Prime Minister, President and Vice President
on their foreign visits. The division played
its role in providing accreditation facilities,
access to ceremonial areas, transport,
accommodation etc. and issuing media
advisories to foreign and Indian media

France, Germany, Guyana, Iran, Israel,
Lesotho, Laos, Mauritius, Mongolia,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Poland,
Romania, Senegal, Singapore, Slovak
Republic, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname
and Zambia. Similar facilities were also
provided to the Indian media delegations
travelling abroad on VVIP visits. The
Division contributed effectively by setting up
media centres with Internet, telephone, fax
and other facilities as also liaison with local
authorities during the VVIP visits to
Bulgaria, China, France, Germany,
Indonesia, Myanmar, Russia, Seychelles,
Sudan, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan,
Thailand, Turkey, UAE and New York
(UNGA). External Affairs Ministers visits to
Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Botswana,
Cambodia, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan,
Mauritius, Myanmar, Russia, Singapore,
South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Syria,
Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey and
USA were also serviced in a similar manner.
Elaborate arrangements, including transport
by two chartered aeroplanes, were made for
a media contingent of over 300 journalists,
which covered the 12th SAARC Summit,
held in Islamabad in January 2004.
Assistance was also provided to Indian
journalists based in foreign countries and
those going abroad on special missions.
The Division provides assistance in respect
of credential documents, visas, residence
per mits etc. to approximately 300
representatives of foreign news agencies and
media organizations based in India. During
the period under report, visa extension and/
or accreditation facilities were extended to
about 195 foreign journalists. More than 70
journalists from ethnic media from abroad
were serviced during each of the 1st and 2nd
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas held in New Delhi
in January 2003 and January 2004.

India Perspectives
The Ministrys monthly magazine, India
Perspectives remained the cornerstone of
the Divisions efforts to promote India with
special emphasis on Indias rich cultural
!

heritage. The circulation of the magazine
through Indian missions and posts remained
largely steady at about 55000 copies per
month. The magazine continued to be
published in 10 different international
languages chosen to give it wide reach.
Besides Indian culture, conscious efforts were
made to project modern India to the world
audience through carefully selected articles
on the impressive achievements of the Indian
economy, rapid strides made by India in IT
and S&T, global appeal of popular Indian
films, immense potential for tourism in India
etc. The articles, encompassing all facets of
life in India, were illustrated by aesthetic
photographs and caricatures. Indias foreign
policy orientations in todays world scenario
were also sought to be projected in a subtle
manner through the magazine. The current
and old issues of India Perspectives were also
made available on the website of the
Ministry. Judging from the positive feedback
received from Indian embassies around the
world, the magazine has been able to
establish a niche for itself in several
countries. The January 2003 issue of India
Perspectives was solely devoted to the Indian
Diaspora to mark the First Pravasi Bharatiya
Divas.

Audio-Visual Publicity
The commissioning and supply of
documentaries, presentation/lending of old
documentaries and feature films to Indian
missions and foreign gover nments/
organizations, dubbing and subtitling of
films in foreign languages, procurement and
supply of feature films for participation in
film festivals and Indian film weeks abroad,
organizing cultural publicity and exhibitions
etc. are some of the major audio-visual
publicity activities undertaken by the
External Publicity Division.
A crisp 15-minute film, Fulfilling the
Vision, showcasing modern India and the
rapid strides that the country has taken,
particularly in infrastructure, space and IT
over the last 5 years was produced in
September 2003. The film was shown during
Prime Ministers interactions worldwide and
many Missions used it during the Republic
Day 2004 celebrations.

Seven more documentaries were completed
on a variety of themes consistent with Indian
foreign policy and promotion of Indian
interests. The documentaries included

and several other documentaries were also
commissioned and are in various stages of

commissioned by the Ministry were
organized for the diplomatic community
based in New Delhi, Indian and foreign
media personnel and eminent persons from
the world of art and cinema. The latter also
won the Best Promotional Film award at
50 th National Film Awards 2003. The
External Publicity Division actively
supported the 34th International Film Festival

weeks were organized in Chile, Egypt,
France, Kenya, Maldives, Mauritius,
Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, Russia,
Spain, UK and USA (Washington, New

acquired and sent to the missions for noncommercial telecast on foreign TV channels.
Besides, audio-visual material in the form of
telecast quality Betacam cassettes, CDROMs, audio and video CDs and cassettes
were also supplied to the missions for

15. Passport, Visa and Consular Services

T

he CPV Division of the Ministry of
External Affairs through the Central
Passport Organisation (CPO) and through
the passport, visa and consular wings of
Indian Missions and posts abroad provide a
direct interface with the general public in
India, with the Indian community resident
abroad and with the foreign nationals. The
Ministry issues passports and renders
passport related services through its Passport
Offices in India.
Currently there are 30 Passport Offices in
India. The last one was opened in Surat in
August 2003. Government has also decided
to open Passport Offices in the remaining
two new states i.e. Chhatisgarh and
Uttranchal as well as in the city of Shimla.
Arrangements for opening of these three
passport offices are being worked out.
As part of Decentralisation Scheme, District
Passport Cells (DPCs) have been opened at
districts level where the office of the District
Magistrate or Superintendent of Police
receives passport applications and after
scrutiny and police verification forwards
them to the concerned Passport Office for
issuance of passports. Currently there are
about 380 DPCs covering more than half
of the districts in India.
All Passport Offices, including the
recently opened Passport Office in
Surat, are computerized. All Passport
Offices are issuing machine printed
and machine readable passports.

As part of strengthening of public grievances
mechanism, all Passport Offices have been
instructed to set up Facilitation Counters and
Help Desk to assist applicants and also to
attend to any grievances/complaints
promptly.

Passport Services
Decentralisation through Post
Offices and District Offices
The Division aims at making the passport
services easily accessible to the public by
enabling them to deposit their passport
applications through a wide network of
offices at the District/Sub-divisional level.

District Passport Cells

Building Projects

Decentralisation at district level envisages
acceptance of passport applications at
district level through a designated office (DM
or SP) in each district of the country. The
designated offices function as the District
Passport Cells (DPCs). Under the system,
the DPCs after accepting the applications get
police verification carried out and send the
applications with the Police Verification
Reports to the concerned Passport Office.
As of now, 380 DPCs are functioning in the
country. Opening of DPCs has resulted in
decongestion in Passport Offices to a large
extent. Besides speeding up police
verification process, it has also provided a
great relief to the public who do not have to
travel long distances to reach Passport
Offices. The passport applications are also
received through the network of Speed Post
Centres. Currently there are about 150 such
Speed Post Centres accepting Passport
Applications.

The Government has taken up construction
of buildings to house the Passport Offices at
Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Jaipur,
Bhubaneshwar. At present, Passport Office
buildings at seven places (Mumbai, Cochin,
Kozhikode, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Panaji
and Patna) are owned by the Ministry of
External Affairs. The building for Passport
Office at Chandigarh was completed.
Passport Office buildings at seven places are
owned by Central Gover nment/State
Government and are rented in 18 places.
The process for purchase of land at five
places
i.e.
Thiruvananthapuram,
Tiruchirapalli, Guwahati, Jammu and
Jallandhar is also in progress. The Division
is also trying to take a property for Passport
Office Srinagar on long-term lease.

Ongoing Innovations
The Tatkaal Scheme for out-of-turn issue
of passports has enabled the system to
speedily respond to demand for issuance of
passports in urgent cases. During the year
2003 a total of 1,61,216 Passports were
issued under Tatkaal Scheme resulting in
additional revenue of Rs.24.37crore.
Review of Passport Issue System
A Committee on Review of the Passport
Issue System which was set up in the
Cabinet Secretariat in 2001, made various
recommendations to simplify the passport
issue system. A large number of
recommendations have already been
implemented and the remaining
recommendations are being processed in
consultation with the concerned agencies.
The main recommendations of the
Committee relate to the decentralisation of
the passport issue system at the State level
through the establishment of District
Passport Cells and the simplification of
procedures so as to do away with the police
verification requirement for applicants from
certain categories.

Computerisation
At present, all the 30 Passport Offices have
been computerised. Websites have been
established in almost all Passport Offices.
Status check of passport applications
through Internet is operational.
Volume of Passport Applications
During the year, a total number of 29,55,529
passports were issued and 3,28,935
miscellaneous services were rendered. While
there was an increase of 10.84% in the issue
of Passports, the miscellaneous service
rendered registered a decrease of 5.27% in
comparison to passports issued/
miscellaneous services rendered during the
corresponding period in the year 2002.
Detailed figures of receipt of passport
applications/passports issued/ miscellaneous
services rendered including total revenue and
expenditure of passport offices are at
Appendix IV.
Machine Writing of Passports
All 30 Passport Offices are issuing machine
printed and machine readable passports
which have the scanned photograph and
signature of the applicant printed on the
passports.
Scanning of Passport Files

Training of the CPO Personnel
In order to improve working skills of the
officials of passport offices, computer
training was arranged for 328 officials of
Passport Offices.
Passport Officers Conference

on
modernization, decentralization,
elimination of pendencies, speedy
redressal of public grievances, proper
maintenance of Passpor t Office
premises and zero tolerance towards
corruption and negligence. These also
formed part of the agenda of the
conference.

Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad render
consular services to Indian nationals living
and working in foreign countries. In cases
of deaths of Indians abroad, prompt
assistance was provided by our Missions and
Posts for completing the formalities for early
despatch of the mortal remains, liaison with
the local and Indian authorities and keeping
the relatives of the deceased informed.
Visas
Over the years, the procedure for grant of
visa by our Missions and Posts has been
liberalised. Many Missions and Posts grant
visas either on the same day or within 48
hours.

"

161 Indian Missions and Posts abroad
provided visa services to 7,46,702
foreigners during the period from
January, 2003 to June, 2003.

Visa related agreements

facilitate travel between Indian and other
countries, bilateral agreements on visa free
travel for diplomatic and official passport
holders were signed with Thailand, Chile,
Armenia, Israel, Hungary, Peru, Tajikistan
and Myanmar during the year 2003-04.
Consular Attestation

Bilateral Agreements
In order to provide a legal and institutional
framework to combat organised crime,
international terrorism and drug trafficking,
and to respond to the growing international
dimensions of financial and other crime,
bilateral agreements are being negotiated
with several countries to provide legal underpinning to this international effort. These
consular agreements include Extradition
Treaties, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties
(MLATs) in Criminal Matters and Mutual
Legal Assistance Treaties in Civil Matters.
Extradition Treaties were signed with
France, Poland, South Africa, Mauritius,
Bulgaria and Tajikistan. Extradition Treaties

to negotiate Extradition Treaties and MLATs
in Criminal Matters.
Extradition Cases and Legal
Assistance
The Ministry actively pursues request for
extradition and legal assistance from foreign
Governments both for criminal and civil/
commercial offences. The requests for
extradition emanate from our obligations
under the Extradition Treaties or Extradition
Arrangements entered into with various
countries. During the year 2003, five
extradition requests from various Indian
investigating agencies were forwarded to the
foreign governments. During the same
period India received five extradition
requests from the foreign Governments. In
the year 2003, two persons were extradited
by the Government of India. One person
was extradited to India in 2003. In the year
2003, the Government of India received 105
requests for legal assistance from the foreign
Governments and 24 Indian requests for
legal assistance in criminal matters were
forwarded to the foreign Governments.
Vision

16. Administration and Organisation

In the global arena, the areas of activity of
the Ministry of External Affairs have
increased over a period of time. This
Ministry is actively engaged in various
activities like promoting free trade areas
between India and other parts of the world,
extradition, security related and antiterrorism issues, as well as on pursuing
bilateral cooperation in the commercial,
economic and scientific fields with US,
Russia and other countries. The foreign
policy pursuits and interests of India in the
region and beyond have been growing
steadily. Given the present pace and intensity
of diplomatic activity in which India is
engaged, the need for additional manpower
in the Ministry of External Affairs being felt
now is more acute than ever.
While delivering the Inaugural
Distinguished Persons Lecture in the
Foreign Service Institute in January,
2003, Shri Yashwant Sinha, External
Affairs Minister had emphasized that:
“As an emerging world power, 600 and
odd officers are not sufficient to
provide the sinews for Indian
diplomacy”.

With the opening of Indian Consulate
General at Birgunj, the number of resident
Indian Diplomatic Missions/Posts and other
offices abroad increased to 162. The total
strength of the Indian Foreign Service A (IFS
A), Indian Foreign Service B (IFS B),
Interpreter and Legal & Treaties (L&T)
cadres of the Ministry is 3491 as detailed in
the table at Appendix I.
Recruitments made in the Ministry in 200304 through Direct Recruitment (DR),
Departmental Promotions (DP) and Limited
Department Examinations (LDE) including
the reserved vacancies, are given in the table
at Appendix II. The language proficiency
of the officers in the Ministry is reflected in
the table given at Appendix III.
The cadre review of Indian Foreign Service,
both Branch A and B, is at an advanced stage
of finalisation to meet the functional
requirements of the Ministry and also to
improve the legitimate promotional avenues
of the respective cadres.

The revised Financial Powers of
Government of Indias Representatives
Abroad have been brought out on a CDROM for easy referencing by users. In its
continuing efforts to provide facility to
serving officers, Amendments to Para 5 of
Annexure XI to IFS (PLCA) Rules were
carried out to grant passage to a parent who
becomes single and dependent on the officer
at the time when the officer is posted abroad.

Establishment Division
The Establishment Division of the Ministry
of External Affairs is a service Department

Prague, Chicago and Panama were identified
for this purpose. Properties in Prague and
Chicago were accordingly purchased. It is
proposed to set up a Cultural Centre in
Washington DC and the transaction for a
property which had been identified could not
be completed owing to absence of local
zoning laws. It is now proposed to redevelop
one of our existing properties to house an
auditorium and cultural centre. In
September 2003 the Delegation of Financial
Power Rules have been liberalized and the
Ministrys financial power for such matters

has been raised from Rs.5 crores to Rs.15
crores. This is expected to encourage
acquisition of properties by the Ministry and
our Missions/Posts have been told to send
suitable purchase proposals for processing in
the Ministry.

17. Coordination

T

he Coordination Division consists of
three Wings: Parliament Section,
Coordination Section and Students Cell.
Parliament Section
Coordination Division is the nodal point of
the Ministry of External Affairs for all work
relating to Parliament. The Coordination
Division also organizes the meetings of the
Consultative Committee on External Affairs,
and coordinates and looks after work relating
to Parliamentary Standing Committee on
External Affairs and other Parliamentary

into consideration several factors. These
include guidelines laid down by the
Government of India for this purpose; the
political and functional justification for the
visit; the background and antecedents of the

18. Non Resident Indians and People of
Indian Origin Overseas

C

ontinuing our policy of active
engagement of the Indian Diaspora,
several steps were taken to address their
concerns and meet their expectations and
aspirations.
Responding to the long standing demands
of the Indian Diaspora to strengthen
emotional and cultural bonds with India and
in pursuance of the Prime Ministers
assurance at the PBD 2003, the Ministry of
External Affairs, in coordination with the
Ministry of Home Affairs, secured passage
of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2003
in December 2003, which has since been
enacted to grant Dual Citizenship to the
Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) in 16
specified countries, whose legal systems are
compatible with the concepts of the Dual
Citizenship and which have a large
concentration of the Indian Diaspora.
Consequential changes in the Citizenship
Rules are being finalized by the Ministry of
Home Affairs.

In pursuance of the assurance of the Prime
Minister at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2003,
the Ministry of External Affairs pursued
with the Ministry of Human Resource
Development and secured the Governments
decision to reserve 1/3 rd of the 15%
supernumerary seats reserved for NRIs/
PIOs, across different disciplines in
educational institutions, for children of NRIs
in the Gulf, at the fees applicable to the
resident Indians.
To promote welfare of the overseas Indian
workers, the Ministry of External Affairs
coordinated efforts with the Ministry of
Labour in launching of the Pravasi Bharatiya
Bima Yojana, applicable to all Indian
emigrant workers in December 2003.
The Seventh World Hindi Conference was
held in Paramaribo, Suriname in June 2003,
with participation of over 500 delegates. It

An official delegation from India
participated in the 150 th Anniversary
celebrations of the Indian arrival in the

"$

French Caribbean island of Martinique in
June 2003. A delegation from the French
Caribbean island of Guadeloupe led by the
Deputy Chairman of its General Council
visited India in November 2003 to discuss
the programme of the 150th Anniversary
celebrations of the first Indian arrival in
Guadeloupe. The delegation met the Chief
Minister of Pondicherry from where most
of the PIOs in the Island originally came
and invited a delegation to visit Guadeloupe
for the occasion.
A website www.stio.nic.in was launched
jointly with the Department of Science and
Technology for interactive exchanges with
Scientists and Technologists of Indian origin,
with a view to assist them in their endeavour
to play a role in national development.
An Empowered Committee was constituted
by the Government to discuss possible role
for scientists and technologists of Indian
Origin in the USA, in areas of Internal
Security within the ambit of Indo-American
bilateral relations. The Committee held
three meetings including one in USA.
A national seminar on Private International
Law was organized in December 2003
jointly with Indian Society for International
Law to discuss various matters concerning
marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody,
inheritance etc., which have a bearing on
matrimonial alliance of NRIs and PIOs in
India. Difficulties being faced by NRI/PIO
ex-servicemen abroad in receiving pensions
from India were discussed with Ministry of
Defence and appropriate steps were taken
to obviate the difficulties.
Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD) 2004 was held
on 9-11 January at New Delhi. Over 2000
delegates including 1321 from 61 countries

19. Foreign Service Institute

T

he Foreign Service Institute (FSI)
continued in its endeavor to train
foreign diplomats from all over the world
apart from training of IFS Probationers.
The 2002 batch of the Indian Foreign
Service completed the training at the FSI
and the 2003 batch commenced their
training at the FSI from January 2004.
Foreign Service Institute organised thirtysecond Professional Course for Foreign
Diplomats (PCFD) from 13 January to 21
February 2003 in which 23 diplomats
participated. In addition, two diplomats
from Afghanistan and one from Israel
participated in the above-mentioned PCFD
in term of special agreement. The thirtythird PCFD was successfully held from 24
March to 2 May 2003 .The 34th PCFD was
conducted from 27 October to 5 December
2003, in which diplomats from 26 countries
participated. Another Special Course for Afghan
Diplomats (SCAD) was also conducted during
the period from 21 July to 12 September
2003. Apart from these a special Course for
Lao Diplomats (SCLD) was conducted from
15-26 December 2003.
Earlier FSI used to conduct an Orientation
Course for diplomats resident in India.
However, in order to also target senior-level
diplomats from the capitals of major players
in world affairs, and to expand Indias
outreach in keeping with its emerging
regional and global role, it was decided to
subsume the orientation course in the
Advanced Course on Asia for Foreign Diplomats
(ACAFD), covering Asian affairs with special
references to South Asia and India.
The first ACAFD was successfully held from
1526 September 2003 on a self-financing
basis. Participants included diplomats from
USA, Russia, China, Canada, Germany,
Kuwait, UAE etc. Given the enthusiastic

"&

response to the course, FSI intends to
conduct one such course every six months.
Also, in pursuance with the Government of
Indias policy to continuously develop
knowledge and skills of government officials,
FSI has been entrusted with the
responsibility of the mid-career training of
the Indian Foreign Service. Given the
constraints of our officers being dispersed
all over the world in different time zones,
classroom kind of teaching was found
unsuitable for such training. Development in
Information Technology now make it
possible in delivering online training
programmes through a virtual campus.
Accordingly FSI has recently signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
with IGNOU for designing an inter/
intranet-based virtual campus for the mid
career programme.
Keeping in view the changing nature of
diplomatic work, FSI restructured the
training programme for the 2002 batch
officer trainees of Indian Foreign Service, to
include a two month long module on
economic diplomacy consisting of the
following:
n Lecture sessions on contemporary
issues in the field of international
trade & commerce and Indian &
International economy by a pool of
experts.
n One week long attachment in
Bankers Training College, Mumbai
on functioning of Financial
Institutions.
n Six week long cor porate
attachment organized by Center for
Public Policy, IIM Bangalore.
n One-week attachment with the
Commerce Ministry.

Also, to inculcate proper communication
skills, a workshop was organized with the
help of our former diplomats and an expert
from Indian Institute of Mass
Communications.
During the year 2003, MoUs for cooperation

loans to the Governments of Bangladesh and
Bhutan to assist in the implementation of
developmental projects. During 2003-2004.
The loans extended to Government of
Bangladesh and to Government of Bhutan
amount to Rs.20.50 crores and Rs.327.50
crores, respectively.
4. The Budget of the Ministry of External
Affairs is essentially a Non-Plan Budget.
However, from 1996-97, a Plan head has
been established with the approval of the
Cabinet. This primarily caters to certain
large developmental projects undertaken in
Bhutan, as part of project assistance
requested by Government of Bhutan in the
Government of Indias Aid to Bhutan
Programme. The Tala Hydroelectric Project
currently under implementation in Bhutan
is a prestigious and important project. The
other projects being funded from the Plan
head are the Kurichu Hydroelectric Project
and the Dungsum Cement Plan project, both
in Bhutan.
5. The estimated expenditure on the
Headquarters of the Ministry of External
Affairs during the current financial year is
estimated to be of the order of Rs. 106.94
crores which forms about 3.5% of the total
estimated revenue expenditure of the
Ministry. Estimated expenditure on Indian
Missions and Posts abroad is expected to be
of the order of Rs. 831.83 crores which is
about 27% of the total revenue expenditure
of the Ministry.

Aid to Myanmar
less than 1%

Aid to
Bangladesh
2%

3.1Aid to Bhutan accounts for 68% of Indias
total aid budget. Other important
destinations for Indian aid programs include
African countries- 8%, Nepal  6%,
Bangladesh- 2 %, Sri Lanka  1%, and Other
countries  15%.

6. The Ministry of External Affairs revenue
from Passport and Visa fees and other
receipts are likely to be of the order of Rs.
1074.52 crores. It is estimated that Passport
fees would account for about Rs. 505.69
crores, Visa fees for Rs. 544.91 crores and
other receipts for Rs. 23.92 crores.

Appendix VIII

C & AG Report of Ministry of External Affairs

REVIEW OF GRANT NO. 22
Unspent Provision: The unspent Provision registered a constantly
increasing trend from Rs. 116.26 crore in 1999-2000 to Rs. 136.85
crore in 2000-2001, which further increased to Rs. 258.84 crore
during 2001-2002.
Schemes Affected by Unspent Provision: The main areas/
schemes affected by unspent provision during 2001-02 were Embassies
and Missions (Rs. 36.12 crore); Discretionary Expenditure (Rs. 54.03
crore); aid to Bhutan (Rs. 25.25 crore); Aid to Nepal (Rs. 69.47 crore);
Construction-External affairs (Rs. 41.77 crore) and loans to
Government of Bangladesh (Rs. 26.84 crore). This trend of large
unspent provision was also persistent during previous years 19992001.
Surrender of Unspent Provision: while the Ministry surrendered
only 33 to 51 per cent of the total unspent provision during the period
1999-2002, even these were not surrendered till the last day of the
financial year except on 28.03.02 for 2001-2002.
Unrealistic Budgeting: Under 17 sub-heads there was excess
provisioning leading to unspent provision ranging between 23 and
99 per cent during 2001-02. Under 7 sub-heads under-provisioning
lead to excess expenditure over the original budget estimates during
2001-2002.
Injudicious re-Appropriation: In 5 cases re-appropriation of
funds to sub-heads remained fully unutilised during 2001-2002. In 2
cases sub-heads from which funds were re-appropriated, ultimately
ended up with excess expenditure. Similar trend in previous years
1999-01 also.
Irregular Re-Appropriation: Augmenting funds in excess of Rs.
1.00 crore through re-appropriation in a sub-head was made without
approval of Secretary(Expenditure).
Rush of Expenditure: Under six major heads the expenditure
incurred during March 2002 and last quarters of 2001-02 ranged
between 13 to 65 per cent and 31 to 67 per cent of total expenditure
under the major head respectively. Similar trend existed during 19992001 also.
Deficient Control by PAO: The Pay and Accounts Office of the
Ministry made excess payment of Rs.50.07 crore over the available
funds during 2001-02 under three sub-heads.
Unauthorised expenditure on engagement of locally
recruitted and contingency-paid personnel: Notwithstanding
repeated audit observations and instructions issued in pursuance
thereof, Missions and Posts abroad continued to violate the rules and
regulations governing the employment of locally recruitted personnel

and staff paid form contingencies resulting in unauthorised
expenditure aggregating to Rs.5.99 crore.
Avoidable additional expenditure: Non-adherence by the
Indian Missions at Bratislave, Bucharest, Minsk, Moscow, Prague
and Warsaw to the Ministrys specific instructions in regard to
provision of air tickets to trainees nominated under the ITEC
Programme resulted in an estimated additional expenditure of
Rs.1.70 crore.
Avoidable additional expenditure on property purchase:
Contrary to its own norms and the assurance to the Public Accounts
Committee, the Ministry approved the purchase of a residential
property in Budapest far in excess of the entitlement of the officer
for whom it was intended and containing inessential and ostentatious
facilities involving substantial additional investment and recurring
expenditure on maintenance.
Avoidable expenditure on premature leasing of a
temporary residence: Failure, in contravention of the Ministrys
specific instructions, to synchronize the leasing of a temporary
residence for the Ambassador to Spain with the renovation of the
Government owned Embassy Residence resulted in avoidable
expenditure of Rs.36.49 lakh.
Avoidable additional expenditure: Failure of the Indian Mission
at Warsaw to entrust the painting of the exterior of the Embassy
Residence to the lowest bidder resulted in avoidable additional
expenditure of Rs.14.50 lakh.
Irregularities in hiring of Embassy residence and
avoidable expenditure on rent: Contrary to the specific
stipulation prohibiting any private understanding with landlords and
in transgression of the dictates of propriety, the Mission in Algiers
entered into two separate lease deeds prescribing different rents in
respect of the Embassy Residence in compliance with the landlords
wishes.
(Para 4.6 of Report No.2 of 2003)
Transaction Audit Observations
Recurring loss of interest attributable to deficiencies in
resource management: Repeated audit observations
notwithstanding, cash management by overseas Missions continuing
to be deficient resulting in retention of cash balances in excess of
actual requirements and consequential recurring loss of interest.
