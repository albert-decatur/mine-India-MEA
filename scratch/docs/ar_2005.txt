former King Zahir Shah and held talks with Foreign
Minister Dr. Abdullah. He inaugurated the new surgical
block of the Indira Gandhi Hospital, which had been
reconstructed with Indias assistance. Afghan Foreign
Minister, Dr. Abdullah paid a return visit to India on 3&
4 July 2005.

Afghanistan

The year 2005 saw the fulfillment of the Bonn Agreement
in Afghanistan with the completion of the Parliamentary
and Provincial Council elections in September 2005.
Indias bilateral relations with Afghanistan attained a
higher level of interaction. Afghan President Hamid
Karzai paid a working visit to India from 23-25 February
2005 and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh paid a return
visit to Kabul on 28&29 August 2005. There were regular
political exchanges between the two countries. India
continued to strengthen its assistance programme for
Afghanistans rehabilitation and reconstruction.

Bilateral relations got further strengthened when Prime
Minister paid an official visit to Afghanistan on 28&29
August 2005. The two leaders underlined that the
establishment of a sovereign, stable, democratic and
prosperous Afghanistan was essential for peace and
stability in the region. They condemned global terrorism
as a threat to democracy and declared that there could
be no compromise with those who resorted to terrorism.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed Indias continued
commitment to Afghanistans reconstruction and pledged
an additional financial assistance of $ 50 million. During
the visit, the foundation stone for Afghanistans new
Parliament building, to be constructed under Indias
assistance programme, was also laid. Three documents
were signed, which included an MoU on Small
Development Projects, an Agreement on Cooperation in

One of the significant changes in the political landscape
of Afghanistan in 2005 was the conduct of the
Parliamentary and 34 Provincial Council elections, in
September 2005. Subsequently, the newly constituted
Afghan National Assembly was convened on 19
December 2005. However, peace and stability eluded
Afghanistan with repeated incidents of violence
engineered by suspected Taliban, Al Qaeda and Hizb-eIslami elements, with outside support. The year 2005 was
the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the end of Taliban
regime in 2001, when more than 1500 Afghan citizens
died. In addition, the problem of cultivation, production
and trafficking of narcotic drugs persisted, thereby
undermining the political and economic reconstruction
of Afghanistan.

the field of Healthcare and Medicinal Science and an
MoU on Cooperation in the field of Agricultural Research
and Education. A Joint Press Statement was issued during
the visit.
India welcomed Afghanistans decision to seek
membership of the SAARC. In the Final Declaration of
13th SAARC Summit on 13 November 2005 in Dhaka,
Afghanistan was formally invited to join SAARC as a
member.

Despite the difficult internal situation in Afghanistan,
bilaterally, India and Afghanistan achieved significant
progress. One of the first bilateral interactions at the
highest level in 2005 was the working visit of President
Karzai, accompanied by eight Cabinet Ministers, to India
from 23-25 February 2005. Two MoUs on Cooperation in
the field of Civil Aviation and Media & Information were
signed during the visit.

India’s Assistance to Afghanistan
Indias present commitments add up to US $ 550 million
over the period 2002-2010. Some of the major commitments
made by India in Afghanistan in 2005 included:

In an unfortunate turn of events, an official of the Border
Roads Organisation, Shri Maniyappan Raman Kutty, who
was working in the Zaranj-Delaram road project was
abducted on 19 November 2005 and later killed on 22
November 2005 by suspected Taliban militants. The
Government of India had made every effort to seek the
safe release of the abductee, in cooperation with Afghan
authorities. Despite this set back, India reiterated its
commitment towards Afghanistans reconstruction.

Bangladesh
Indias relations with Bangladesh are characterized by
close historical and cultural affinities. Ties with
Bangladesh were strengthened through wide ranging
interaction and visits at political and official level
including at the highest political level in the context of
the SAARC Summit. In recent years, there have been a
number of initiatives that have strengthened bilateral ties
though security concerns continue to impede greater
development in bilateral ties. These concerns relate to
the presence and activities of Indian insurgent groups and
their leaders from the northeast of India on Bangladesh
soil, the rising influence of political parties and
organizations of radical Islamic and fundamentalist
orientation and border crimes including illegal crossings.

China
The year 2005 marked the 55 th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between India and
China. During the year, high-level political exchanges
coupled with expansion of functional cooperation
enhanced the bilateral relationship. 
The visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to India 9-12
April 2005 signified a milestone in bilateral relations. The
outcome of the visit was substantive. Eleven Agreements/
MoUs were signed. A report of the Joint Study Group

A Protocol on Modalities for the Implementation of
Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field Along
the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border
Areas was also concluded during the visit. It was
reiterated that pending a final resolution, the two sides
would continue to make joint efforts to maintain peace
and tranquility in the border areas. Both sides also agreed
that it was important that the Joint Working Group (JWG)
also continued its work to seek an early clarification and
confirmation of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  

(JSG) on the future direction of India-China trade and
economic relations was presented to the two Prime
Ministers.  
Both sides reached broad consensus on bilateral, regional
and international issues of common concern. Reviewing
the progress in bilateral ties in recent years the two sides
agreed that India-China relations had entered a new stage
of comprehensive development. It was decided to upgrade
the India-China relationship to a strategic and
cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity.

Development of trade and economic relations was a major
area of focus of Premier Wens visit.  Both sides agreed to
set a target of bilateral trade volume of US$ 20 billion or
higher by 2008. The Joint Study Group (JSG) report
presented to the two Prime Ministers identified a series
of measures related to trade in goods, trade in services,
investments and other areas of economic cooperation,
and recommended their expeditious implementation to
remove impediments and facilitate enhanced economic
engagement between India and China. The two Prime
Ministers tasked the Ministerial-level India-China Joint
Economic Group (JEG) to consider these
recommendations and coordinate their implementation.
The JSG has also recommended an India-China Regional
Trading Arrangement, comprising trade in goods and
services, investments, trade and investment promotion
and facilitation, and measures for promotion of economic
cooperation in identified sectors. The two Prime Ministers
agreed to appoint a Joint Task Force to study in detail the
feasibility of, and the benefits that may derive from, the
India-China Regional Trading Arrangement and give

The two Prime Ministers signed a Joint Statement on April
11 2005.The Joint Statement reflected the consensus that
India-China relations transcended bilateral issues and
have acquired a global and strategic perspective. In this
context, it was agreed to further develop and diversify
bilateral relations and to resolve outstanding differences
in a proactive manner without letting them come in the
way of continued development of relations. The year 2006
was declared as the Year of India-China Friendship. 
During the visit, the two sides exchanged views on the
India-China boundary question and reiterated their
readiness to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable
solution, through equal and friendly consultations and
proceeding from the overall interests of bilateral relations.
An important outcome of the visit was the signing of the

On the economic front, India remains committed to
achieving the mutually agreed target of increasing bilateral
trade to US$ 1 billion by 2006. During 2004-05, Indias

7 May 2005. As regards transportation of gas from
Myanmar to India, the two sides are discussing various
options including a pipeline through North-East India and
import of compressed and liquefied natural gas.

Nepal
As close neighbours India and Nepal share a unique
relationship of friendship and cooperation underpinned
by cultural and wide-ranging commercial and economic
links. India shares over 1850 kms of open border with
Nepal. There has been a long tradition of free movement
of people across the borders.

India is assisting Myanmar with the delimitation of its
continental shelf and to this end, a workshop was
organised for Myanmar scientists at the National Centre
for Antarctic and Ocean Research in Goa from
24-28 October 2005. This will be followed by further
studies at NCAOR, Goa. Meanwhile, the third IndiaMyanmar Joint Workshop on Oceanography was held in
Yangon from 16-24 December 2005.

The political instability and adverse security situation in
Nepal were causes of deep concern to India during the
year. The gap between the Monarchy and political parties
widened, particularly after the 12-point Understanding
in November 2005 between the seven party alliance and
the Maoists. The decision by the Maoists to call-off their
four month long unilateral ceasefire on 2 January 2006
was an unfortunate one. India maintained regular
interaction with the Constitutional forces in Nepal
including the Monarchy and the political parties. Prime
Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh met His Majesty King
Gyanendra of Nepal on the sidelines of Afro-Asian
Summit in Jakarta on 22 April 2005. The two leaders met

Constitutional forces which include both the institution
of Monarchy and the political parties, should work
together in order to confront the challenges facing Nepal,
including the Maoist insurgency. There is no military
solution to the problems facing Nepal. India wishes to
see a peaceful, stable and prosperous Nepal in its
neighbourhood and stands ready to support all efforts
aimed at bringing about a peaceful solution to the
problems confronting Nepal.

Officials of the two Governments met in May, 2005 to
discuss ongoing cooperation in construction of
embankments on selected rivers in Nepal and developing
comprehensive short-term and long-term strategies for
joint efforts at flood control and management of common
rivers. The Joint Team of Experts on Sapt Koshi High
Dam and Sun Kosi Diversion Scheme, to be developed in
Nepal, met in June 2005 to review the field investigations
for the projects being carried out by the Joint Project
Office, established in Nepal in August 2004 for a period
of 30 months with Indian assistance.

Small Development Project Scheme worked successfully
with focus on three sectors  Education, Health and
Infrastructure. At present 115 small and large projects
are under implementation under the small Development
Project scheme, covering 61 districts of Nepal.
Major projects are at the take-off stage. They include the
Bir Hospital Trauma Centre, Manmohan Adhikari
Polytechnic and other border infrastructure development
projects. Invisible Goiter has been eradicated through the
supply of iodized salt from India.

India and Nepal launched a pilot project for regulating
cross-border movement from 1 November 2005 at
Rupaidiha (District Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh)  Nepalgunj
(District Banke, Nepal) check-posts. Under this scheme
Indian and Nepalese citizens crossing the border at this
check-post would require to be in possession of identity
documents, as mutually agreed upon by both
Governments.

India offers annually about 1000 scholarships to Nepalese
students in various courses. In addition, a number of
Nepalese students come to India to study at their own
expense.

Pakistan

India-Nepal bilateral trade grew by 14.4%. By the end of
the Nepalese fiscal year 2004-05, bilateral trade with India
amounting to USD 1.8 billion accounted for 65.8% of
Nepals total external trade. Indias share in Nepals
imports stood at 64.9%. India, on the other hand, absorbed
about 67.7% of Nepals exports.

Relations between India and Pakistan during this period
were marked by a desire to expand their interaction in an
atmosphere free of violence and terrorism, though India
continued to have concerns on this account. The ceasefire
along the Line of Control, International Border and
Actual Ground Position Line (Siachen) that came into
effect on 25 November 2003 continued to hold except
for some minor incidents.

Senior officials from Nepal and India met in Kathmandu
(2-3 December, 2005) to review the provisions of the
India-Nepal Treaty of Transit which was due for renewal
on 5 January, 2006. India decided to extend for a period
of three months the modalities, routes, conditions of

commenced with the meeting of the Foreign Secretaries
in December 2004 crossed several milestones during the
year. The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service started on
7 April 2005 across the Line of Control, allowing the
people to move across and meet with their divided
families. A decision was taken to link up Poonch-Rawalkot
by bus across the LoC and to start a truck service on the
Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route. The two countries
commenced bus service between Amritsar & Lahore while
bus service between Amritsar-Nankana Sahib is expected
to start shortly. The rail service between Munabao in
Rajasthan and Khokhrapar in Sindh of Pakistan has been
resumed after 40 years on 18 February 2006. The two
Governments also agreed in principle, to expand the list
of pilgrimage sites and increase the number of pilgrims by
revising the Protocol signed in 1974. The third round of
the Composite Dialogue commenced as agreed in January
2006.

Commerce & Trade
The year 2005-06 witnessed substantial growth in bilateral
trade which grew from US$ 240 million during AprilAugust last financial year to US$ 299 million during the
same period in 2005-2006, an increase of 25%. Exports
from Pakistan registered a rise of 93% though the trade
balance remained in favour of India. Pakistan increased
its positive list allowing import of Indian goods marginally
to 773 while the Attari-Wagah border was opened by it
for select goods, namely onions, tomatoes, potatoes, garlic
and meat. In July 2005, while announcing its Trade Policy,
Pakistan added three items- sugar, oats and mild steel for
construction to the list of importable items from India.
However, India was still awaiting MFN status to be
accorded by Pakistan even though the same had already
been given by India to Pakistan. The Commerce
Secretaries of two countries had met in August 2005 and
agreed to open Bank branches in each others country.
Reserve Bank of India and its Pakistan counterpart
announced that the process for opening two branches by
each side would start.

Humanitarian Approach to Prisoners
Another achievement of the dialogue process was the
release of 435 Indian prisoners including 371 fishermen,
and 148 Pak prisoners including 51 fishermen by the two
Governments, on 12 September 2005. This was based on
an agreement reached during the Home Secretary level
meeting on 30 August 2005. It was also agreed that the
prisoners issue would be dealt with in a humanitarian
manner by notifying the arrests immediately, providing
consular access within three months and releasing
prisoners as soon as the prison term was over. India
unilaterally released another 26 prisoners on 18 November
2005. There was commitment to continue the goodwill
approach to this humanitarian issue of prisoners.

Other Important Developments
There were further discussions on issues such as Siachen
and Sir Creek. It was agreed in the second round of
Composite Dialogue that a Joint Survey will be held on
the Sir Creek. Differences on Baglihar Hydroelectric
Project were referred to a neutral expert who had held
two meetings so far with the two sides and the third
meeting is expected to be held in February 2006.
Cooperation was also witnessed in the areas of Civil
Aviation and both sides agreed in principle to increase
the number of destinations, frequencies and designated
airlines. The underlying principle for this flexibility was
the desire to provide additional facilities for travel to the
people. The same spirit had also encouraged the two
Governments to agree to reopen their Consulates in

on Pre-notification of the Flight Testing of Ballistic
Missiles and an MoU for Communication Link between
Coast Guard of India (CGI) and Pakistan Maritime
Security Agency (PMSA). The former was an important
Confidence Building Measure while the latter was

maritime agencies guarding the coasts. Besides, an MoU
for cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking was
agreed to in principle and would be signed shortly. Visa

Annual Report 2005 - 2006

Statement issued by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and
President Musharraf reiterated their commitment to the
dialogue process. Foreign Secretary visited Islamabad
from 31 August-2 September 2005 to review the second
round of the Composite Dialogue. Foreign Secretarys visit
was followed by the visit of the then External Affairs
Minister Shri Natwar Singh from 2-5 October 2005 to
review the progress made in the first two rounds of the
Composite Dialogue and to revive the Joint Commission
after a 16-year interregnum. The revival of the Joint
Commission was a major achievement which was
reflective of the desire of the two countries to provide an
institutional basis for bilateral interaction on a sustained
basis.

Pakistan, however, declined Indian offers of helicopters,

Rs. 69 crores or US$ 15.5 million. The High Commission
of Pakistan was also permitted to source supplies and to
open a Bank Account to receive cash donations from
Indians.
Prompt over-flight clearances were accorded for relief
planes of other countries. Pakistans rescue helicopters
were allowed to fly in the no-fly zone close to the LoC
with permission, as a special gesture. Special telephone
centres were opened on the Indian side of the LoC to
facilitate calls by Indians to their relatives in Pakistan/
PoK. Foreign organisations were allowed to source supplies

relief camps, cross-LoC joint relief operations, medical
relief teams and repair of telecom infrastructure.
Cross Border Terrorism
India had continuing concerns on cross-border infiltration
and incidence of terrorist violence in India linked to it.
Despite Pakistans assurance that steps would be taken to
prevent such infiltration, there was no sustained decline
in infiltration and violent incidents. India expressed the
hope that Pakistan would take concrete action in this
regard. The importance of Pakistan fulfilling its
commitment outlined in the Joint Press Statement of
6 January 2004 of not permitting the use of territory under
its control to support terrorism in any manner was
repeatedly reiterated. India made it clear that the whole
dialogue process hinged on building an atmosphere of trust
and confidence, free from violence and terror.

Assistance to Earthquake Victims
There was an outpouring of sympathy in India for the
victims of the earthquake. Prime Minister spoke to
President Musharraf telephonically the same day on 8
October 2005 when the devastating earthquake hit the
northern parts of southern Asia that claimed more than
80,000 lives in PoK and Pakistan. India sent relief material
immediately and announced an assistance of US$ 25
million at the international conference in Geneva
organised by UN Coordinator for Emergency Relief.
Government of India sent Minister of State for External
Affairs to represent India at the international conference
held in Islamabad on 19 November 2005 and offered to
take up reconstruction projects in health and education
sectors and to source construction material from the
amount it pledged at Geneva. Government of India
provided more than 1300 tonnes of relief goods including
the material that were handed over across LoC. Besides

INTERNATIONAL LAW AND
DEVELOPMENTS
Report of the Sixth Committee
The Sixth Committee of the UN had a fruitful session
this year. The Committee adopted two legal instruments
namely, Convention on Electronic Communications and
International Contracts and the Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Safety of United Nations and
Associated Personnel. Efforts were made, throughout the
session, keeping in view the importance given to the
adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on
International Terrorism during this session, to resolve the
remaining outstanding issues on the draft comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), more
importantly, by formulating the language on self
determination, delineation of legal regime under the

109

Annual Report 2005 - 2006

Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism and
International Humanitarian Law, with a view to reach a
consensus. To facilitate further negotiations, the
Committee decided to convene the meeting of the Ad
Hoc Committee to elaborate the Draft Comprehensive
Convention from 27 February-3 March 2006. To make it
clear that the Ad-Hoc Committee should make every
effort to finalize the Convention during this meeting, the
Sixth committee resolution on this agenda item this year,
unlike previous years, did not authorize any Ad-hoc
Committee meeting during the sixty first session. It may
be recalled that sixth committee adopted similar provision
in the last years resolution, which facilitated the
finalization and adoption of the Draft Convention on
Nuclear Terrorism during the meeting of the Ad Hoc
Committee, held in March-April 2005.
Items in the Plenary
This year the debate on the plenary item: Oceans and
the Law of the Sea mainly focused on protection of
worlds marine environment and sustainable fishing
practices. During this session, The General Assembly
decided that the Ad Hoc Open ended Informal Working
Group established pursuant to paragraph 73 of its
resolution 59/24, would study issues relating to the
conservation and sustainable use of marine biological
diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. It also
decided to continue with open ended UN informal
consultative process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea
for the next three years.
The General Assembly decided to launch an assessment
of assessments, to be completed within two years, as a
preparatory stage towards the establishment of the regular
process for global reporting and assessment of the state of
marine environment. In this connection, General
Assembly established an Ad Hoc Steering Group on an
equitable geographical basis including setting out the
functions to be performed by the Steering Group.
On sustainable fisheries, the Assembly requested the
Secretary-General to convene in March 2006, the 5th
round of informal consultations of States Parties to the
Fish Stocks Agreement, to serve as preparation for the
Review Conference. It was also decided that States which
are not parties to the Agreement can also participate fully

in the 5th round of informal consultations of State Parties
to the Agreement on equal footing with States Parties to
the Agreement, except that they will not have voting
rights.
International Maritime Organization (IMO)
The Diplomatic Conference of the IMO held in London
from 10-14 October 2005 adopted the Final Text of the
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against
the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988. This initiative
was taken by IMO in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks on US in 2000. The amended SUA Convention
and its Protocol provides for various issues that are not
connected with terrorism per-se, but are aimed at ensuring
disarmament and non-proliferation issues. Moreover, this
also attempts to legalize the proliferation security
initiative (PSI) activities initiated by the US and its
participants. India opposed these amendments and
recorded its reservations during the Legal Committee as
also during the IMO Diplomatic Conference.
Oceans and Law of the Sea
At its 60th session, the United Nations General Assembly
has adopted two resolutions 60/30 and 60/31 respectively
on the agenda items Oceans and Law of the Sea and 
Sustainable fisheries, including through the 1995
Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of
the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December
1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks,
and related instruments. The General Assembly
reaffirming the unified character of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, stressed the
need for the harmonization of national legislation with
the Convention for the purpose of implementation of its
provisions. The Assembly has called upon the donor
agencies and States to help financially the developing
States and to provide them technical assistance for
building up their capacity to implement the provisions of
the Convention and to prepare their submissions to the
Commission on the Limit of the Continental Shelf
(CLCS). It encouraged the States to cooperate in
combating piracy, armed robbery at sea, smuggling and
terrorist acts against shipping and other maritime interests.
The Assembly also urged the States to control, reduce

110

United Nations and International Organizations

and minimize marine pollution from land-based sources,
and also to improve understanding and knowledge of the
deep sea, in particular of the extent and vulnerability of
deep sea biodiversity and ecosystems. The Assembly has
decided to establish an organizational arrangement in
connection with the work of the Regular process for global
reporting and assessment of the state of the marine
environment, including socio-economic aspects (the
global process). This arrangement would include an ad
hoc steering group to oversee the execution of the
assessment of assessments, two UN agencies to co-lead
the process and a group of experts. The activities of the
arrangement would be financed through voluntary
contributions and other resources available to
participating organizations and bodies.
On matters relating to fisheries, the Assembly called all
States to apply the precautionary and ecosystem approach
to the conservation, management and exploitation of fish
stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly
migratory fish stocks in accordance with the Fish Stocks
Agreement and to harmonize their national laws with the
provisions of the Agreement. It urged the States not to
permit their vessels to engage in illegal fishing on the high
seas or in area under the national jurisdiction of other
States and to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated
fishing.
Special Committee on the UN Charter
The Special Committee on the Charter of the United
Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the
Organizations is considering several proposals relating
to: the maintenance of international peace and security;
the Trusteeship Council; coordination with other
committees/bodies that are also involved in work related
to the maintenance of international peace and security,
in particular with regard to assistance to third states
adversely affected by sanctions. At its 60th session, the
General Assembly after considering the report of the
Special Committee of its work at its 2005 session has
adopted resolution 60/23. The Assembly has requested
the Special Committee to give priority consideration to
implementation of Charter provisions relating to
assistance to third states adversely affected by sanctions.
Indias stand over the years has been that the Security
Council should hold the primary responsibility towards

the affected third States, as a part of the sanctions
imposing decisions.
UNCITRAL
The Legal and Treaties Division participated in Working
Groups meetings of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) relating to
Electronic Commerce, Transportation and Security
Interests. During the 38th Annual Session of UNCITRAL
in July 2005, the Commission adopted the Convention
on the Use of Electronic Communications in International
Contracts. The Convention incorporates many of the
essential principles of the Model Law on Electronic
Commerce, including party autonomy and legal
recognition of electronic communications. However, some
principles have been significantly modified to meet the
need for greater certainty required in a convention,
especially provisions on the time and place of contract.
New principles have also been incorporated in the
Convention, including invitations to make offers, use of
automated information systems, and errors in electronic
communications, reflecting new legal concerns that have
arisen since the release of the first Model Law in 1996.
Maritime Transport Law
The Division participated in the fifteenth and sixteenth
sessions of Working Group III (Transport Law) of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(UNCITRAL), held respectively at New York, USA from

goods by sea and other modes, to cope with the practical
changes in this field resulting from technological
developments. At the fifteenth session, discussions were
held on provisions relating to the Freedom of contract,
Jurisdiction, and arbitration. At the sixteenth session,

New Delhi from 5-7 December 2005. All BIMSTEC
Member States participated in the Meeting. The SubGroup extensively deliberated on the legal framework to

combat terrorism and transnational crime existing in
respective member countries. The Member States also
highlighted various measures, legislative and
administrative, that they have adopted to implement
international conventions on international terrorism and
relevant Security Council resolutions. The delegations
also noted the availability of limited resources, lack of
technical expertise and other complexities involved in
the implementation of counter-terrorism conventions and
other problems involved in inter-governmental
coordination. Delegates further highlighted the need for
the compilation of national laws, bilateral treaties and
regional arrangements to enable them to evolve suitable
mechanism to facilitate extradition and mutual legal
assistance. The delegations also considered the draft
agreement on combating international terrorism,
organized crime and illicit drug trafficking amongst
BIMSTEC Member States, which was proposed by India.
The Sub-group recognised the importance of such an
agreement and decided to further work on the same.

furthering the economic interests of developing countries
in various international organizations and in multilateral,
regional and sub-regional groupings.

SAARC
The Thirteenth SAARC Summit took place in Dhaka
on12 &13 November 2005.
India has long advocated that if South Asia is to become
a dynamic component of the larger process of regional
cooperation and globalization that is taking place in the
world, it must first bring about economic integration
amongst the member countries, as an essential prerequisite. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh put
forward a new vision of a SAARC, where political divisions
do not stand in the way of the free movement of peoples,
goods and services, and ideas, across the region. In this
context, Prime Minister offered, on a reciprocal basis,
transit facilities to all countries of the region and also
greater air connectivity through a virtual open skies
arrangement.
A consensus decision was taken by the SAARC Heads of
State and Government to welcome Afghanistan as
SAARCs eighth member. With Afghanistans entry,
SAARC would acquire a more complete regional identity.
The Summit noted the renewed interest of other regional
and international organizations and entities to cooperate
with SAARC in fields of mutual interest. India has
welcomed the interest shown by China as well as Japan
to be associated with SAARC as Observers.
Indias offer for hosting the SAARC Centre for Disaster
Management and Preparedness has been welcomed and
accepted by the Summit. There was a clear recognition
that a permanent regional response mechanism dedicated

to disaster preparedness, emergency relief and
rehabilitation is required. Indias record and demonstrated
capabilities in this regard are well known. This Centre
will be closely associated with the National Institute for
Disaster Management in Delhi.
The proposal made by India for the setting up of a South
Asia University that would bring together scholars,
scientists and students from all over South Asia in a center
of excellence was welcomed.
The Summit has also noted with appreciation the other
proposals made by India, such as the setting up of a
Regional Food Bank, SAARC Museum of Textiles &
Handicrafts, a Regional Tele-medicine Network, and the
holding of a SAARC Car Rally in the run up to the 14th
SAARC Summit.
A major theme at the Summit was cooperation in counter
terrorism. The Summit Declaration contained a strong
condemnation of terrorism, and a renewed commitment
to eliminate this scourge. For the first time, there was
also a clear reference to avoid double standards in tackling
this collective challenge.
The Summit was also notable for the signing of three
important trade facilitation agreements. These included:
n

The Agreement on Mutual Administrative
Assistance in Customs Matters

n

The Agreement on the Establishment of SAARC
Arbitration Council.

for India across the continents.
The TC Division has been allocated an amount of Rs. 49
crores under ITEC and Rs. 6.5 crores under SCAAP while
the DP Division has been allocated Rs. 8 crores under

Consular, Passport and Visa Services

The CPV Division of the Ministry of External Affairs
through the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) and
the passport, visa and consular wings of Indian Missions
and posts abroad provides passport and consular services
to Indian citizens and NRIs and consular and visa services
to foreign nationals.
There are at present 30 Passport Offices in India. All
Passport Offices have been computerized; and they issue
machine-printed and machine-readable passports. Grant
orders for issue of passport are generated electronically.
All routine passport related work such as generation of
cash, index checking, printing of passports, addresses and
dispatch is computerized and records are maintained
electronically. Passport Applications are also being
scanned and stored electronically.
As part of strengthening the public grievances mechanism,
all Passport Offices have been instructed to set up
Facilitation Counters and Help Desks to assist applicants
and also to attend to grievances/complaints expeditiously.
A public grievances mechanism also exists within the CPV
Division under close supervision of the Joint Secretary in
charge of the Division. As provided by the Right to
Information Act, 2005, a Central Public Information
Officer and Assistant Public Information Officers have
been appointed to provide information to the citizens.

Passport Services
Decentralisation through Post Offices and
District Offices
As part of a Decentralisation Scheme, District Passport
Cells (DPCs) have been opened at district levels where
the office of the District Magistrate/Superintendent of
Police receives passport applications and after scrutiny
and police verification, forwards them to the concerned
Passport Office for issuance of passports. Currently, there
are 462 DPCs in 28 States/UTs in India. The opening of

15

DPCs has resulted in decongestion in Passport Offices to
a large extent. In addition to expediting the police
verification process, DPCs also provide relief to the
applicants who do not have to travel long distances to
approach Passport Offices. The passport applications are
also received through the network of Speed Post Centres.
Currently there are 218 Speed Post Centres accepting
passport applications. There is a proposal under active
consideration to open additional Speed Post Centres in
the future.
Ongoing Innovations
The Tatkaal Scheme for out-of-turn issue of passports
has enabled the system to speedily respond to demand
for issuance of passports on urgent basis. During the year
2005 a total of 244516 passports were issued under the
Tatkaal Scheme resulting in an additional revenue of Rs.
39.85 crore. Tele-enquiry system is available in 22 Passport
Offices and touch screen enquiry kiosk has been
introduced in PO Bangalore on a pilot basis.
Review of Passport Issuance System
An Inter-Ministerial Committee on Review of the
Passport Issuance System, which was set up in the Cabinet
Secretariat has made several recommendations to simplify
the passport issuance system. A large number of
recommendations have already been implemented and
the remaining recommendations are being processed for
implementation, in consultation with the concerned
agencies. As a result, the passports are now issued quickly.
The time period for Tatkaal for fresh applications has been
reduced to a maximum of 20 days instead of the earlier
35 days. In all re-issue cases, the same has been brought
down from 1-10 days to 1-5 days. A full 10 year validity
passport is now issued in all cases of additional booklet,
lost passport, damaged passport and in case of change in
appearance, name, date of birth, place of birth and
signatures.

Annual Report 2005 - 2006

Infrastructure
The construction of buildings to house the Passport
Offices at Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Jaipur and
Bhubaneshwar has been taken up. At present, Passport
Office buildings at eight places viz Mumbai, Chandigarh,
Cochin, Kozhikode, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Patna and
Panaji are owned by MEA. Office premises in six Passport
Offices are owned by Central Government/State
Government and are rented in 16 Passport Offices. The
process for purchase of land for four Passport Offices i.e.
Tiruchirapalli, Guwahati, Jallandhar and Mumbai is also
underway. Due to an incident of fire caused by militants
in the month of January 2005, the RPO, Srinagar was
completely gutted. It was restored to full function in the
month of May 2005 in a rented building.
Computerisation
At present, all 30 Passport Offices have been
computerised. E-mail facility is available at all
computerised Passport Offices. Web-pages have also been
created for all Passport Offices. A proposal for a
comprehensive computerised network and connectivity
with interlinking of all Passport Offices is being looked in
to.
Workload
During the period Jan-Dec 2005, a total number of
3570730 passports were issued and 464122 miscellaneous
services were rendered. Passport-Office wise break-up of
the figures for number of passport applications received/
passports issued/misc services rendered and revenue and
expenditure is at Appendix-IV. A pendency drive at Delhi
RPO during February and March 2005 was undertaken
to clear the pendency of about 43000 files. A similar drive
was also undertaken at Jaipur and Ghaziabad during the
year. The Staff Inspection Unit (SIU) of the Ministry of
Finance conducted norms study of Passport Offices and
submitted their report in the first week of December 2005.
Proposal for augmentation of staff in various grades in
the Passport Offices has been sent to Finance Ministry.
This would take care of the increasing workload in the
passport issuance system.
Scanning of Passport Files
Lack of sufficient space for storage of old applications and
difficulties in speedy retrieval for reference or for court

related matters has been a long standing problem. To
overcome this problem, it was decided to scan old
applications and to store the information in CDs. CNE
(Committee on Non-Plan Expenditure) approval was
obtained. Scanning of old passport application has been
completed in all Passport Offices.
Passport Officers Conference
A Passport Officers Conference was held at Kolkata on 1
September, 2005. Minister of State for External Affairs,
Shri E. Ahamed, who inaugurated the Conference,
directed to initiate pendency clearance drive in all
Passport Offices during 15-30 September 2005.
Accordingly, efforts were made to clear the pendency.
Minister of State for External Affairs also desired that
the internal vigilance in the CPV Division should be
strengthened. Necessary steps were taken to strengthen
the vigilance system in the Central Passport Organisation.

Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad render consular services to
Indian citizens and NRIs abroad. In cases of deaths of
Indians abroad, prompt assistance was provided by our
Missions and Posts for completing the formalities for early
despatch of the mortal remains, liaison with the local and
Indian authorities and keeping the relatives of the
deceased informed. The Staff Inspection Unit (SIU) of
the Ministry of Finance conducted study, to review the
norms for Consular work, which were 27 years old, at
Dubai, Dhaka, London, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait and
submitted their report in October 2005. All the Missions
and Posts have been requested to send their requirement
of staff on the basis of the revised norms evolved. A
consolidated proposal for augmentation of staff containing
both India based and Local posts has been forwarded in
December 2005, to Finance Ministry for approval.
In the case of number of Indians arrested abroad and
number of deaths of Indians abroad, the data is incomplete
and awaited. The amount of compensation paid to the
dependents in cash through Indian Missions at the
following countries during the period of report is indicated

Visa Services
Over the years, the procedure for grant of visa by our
Missions and Posts has been simplified. Most Missions
and Posts grant visas either across the counter on the same
day or within 48 hours.
A project for computerisation of the Visa & Passport
Wings of the Missions and Posts in the Gulf, West Europe
and North America is under implementation. In the first
phase, those Missions and Posts would be computerised
where the volume of services rendered is high.
Computerisation of Consular activities has been
completed in Dubai, Islamabad and New York during the
year. Several more Missions are being computerised.

efficient.

Consular Agreements – Extradition and
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements
In order to provide a legal and institutional framework to

The Ministry actively pursues requests for extradition and
legal assistance from foreign Governments both for
criminal and civil/commercial offences. The requests for
extradition emanate from Indias obligations under the
Extradition Treaties or Extradition Arrangements entered
into with various countries. During the year 2005, 9
Extradition requests from various investigation agencies
were forwarded to the Foreign Governments. During the
same period, India received 10 extradition requests from

Effective pursuance of Indias foreign policy objectives
necessitates increase in Indias diplomatic presence
abroad. Equally important is to ensure that the
Headquarters of the Ministry is adequately manned at all
levels. The challenge for the Administration Division was
to optimize the available resources to ensure requisite
deployment levels in the face of dwindling number of
support staff. Towards this objective, following detailed
studies, deployment of personnel was rationalized taking
into account possible synergies in overlapping functions
and total available resources. In a special initiative, with

examined various aspects of the indexation system vis-àvis systems followed by the ICSC and the EC for making
the indexation scheme more effective and responsive to
the changing global environment. One of the important
suggestions was to examine the possibility of reviewing
the basket of goods and services for adapting it to the
present day consumption pattern. A special committee
headed by Additional Secretary (Admn.) has already been
set up for this purpose. The Ministry has also prepared a
comprehensive proposal for the rationalization of the
system of representational grant taking into account the
growing global profile of India as well as the changing
cost of living. Once approved, the new system would be
more rational and equitable, besides having an in-built
system of self-correction based on partial indexation of
the scheme. The system of special grants to our Heads of
Mission/Post for dealing with special occasions, including

135

Annual Report 2005 - 2006

VIP and VVIP visits has also been further streamlined.
Another important step is the governments decision to
grant hardship allowance to India-based officers working
in our Missions/Posts in Afghanistan and Iraq to alleviate
the impact of extreme hardship.
Special efforts were made for better maintenance of MEA
premises in South Block and Akbar Bhavan. Besides
upgrading common facilities, the Ministry is working on
a programme to introduce modular sitting arrangement
in the various divisions/sections for more efficient space
utilization. Steps are also being taken for upgrading and
improving the existing fire fighting infrastructure in South
Block and Akbar Bhavan.
External Affairs Hostel at K.G. Marg was given a facelift.
The entire property was painted and the reception area
was upgraded with better flooring and interiors. The old
lifts at the New Hostel, Gole Market, are also in the
process of being replaced. Steps are being taken for
improving the occupancy of the MEA Housing Complex
in Dwarka by effectively addressing the problems of
security, communications and water supply. Five units
have been partially furnished to be converted into transit
houses to take care of the initial accommodation
requirement of officers returning from abroad.
The first phase of the renovation of C-I Hutments on
Dalhousie Road for the Archives & Records Management
Division has been completed. Efforts are also under way
for improving the entrance at Gate No. 4 and 8 of South
Block. The Ministry is also working on a proposal for
creating a special Map-cum-Situation room with the
state-of-the-art technology.
The committee for selection of art objects for our Missions/
Posts abroad met on as many as four occasions during
2005, besides several visits to reputed art galleries/emporia
for identifying suitable art objects. The Committee also
undertook visits to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai
for establishing direct contacts with regional producers/
suppliers of art work. The requirements of a majority of
the Missions/Posts were met.
The preparatory work was by and large completed on the
project for renovation of Jinnah House, Mumbai, the site
for the SAARC Sub-Regional Cultural Centre. Work on
the project is expected to start soon.

The Ministry has initiated a proposal for updating the
Delegation of Financial Powers of Heads of Mission/Post
abroad for bringing them in line with the present situation.
Separately, a number of individual proposals have also
been initiated for streamlining the procedures, especially
with regard to plinth area norms for leasing of property;
provision of furniture and equipment at the residences of
Heads of Mission/Post; provision of Indian and
international TV channels for Head of Missions/Posts
abroad; and simplification of procedure for acquisition of
official cars.

Projects Division
Projects Division is responsible for purchase of built-up
properties and construction of properties in India and
abroad for the use of Ministry of External Affairs.
Proposals relating to repairs/renovation of Government
owned properties in stations abroad are also handled by
the Projects Division. As of now, Government owns 77
Chancery buildings, 83 HOM/HOP residences and 610
officers/staff residences abroad. Currently, 37 construction
projects including three major renovation/ redevelopment projects in Geneva, Singapore and Karachi
are at different stages of execution.
Construction is in progress on the Foreign Service
Institute Complex in New Delhi, the Asian African Legal
Consultative Organisations (AALCO) Complex in New
Delhi, the ICCR Regional Office in Kolkata and for RPOs
buildings at Jaipur, Bangalore and Lucknow. As for

Complex in Warsaw. Construction projects such as the
residential complex in Islamabad, Embassy Complex in
Brasilia, apartments in London and Embassy Complex in
Tashkent are in advance stages of processing and the
financial approval of competent authorities is being
sought. For the re-development of Government owned
properties in Tokyo and for construction of Chancery and
residential units in Dhaka, respective consultants have

Committee.
Based on progress of pre-construction activities, it is
expected that a number of projects may reach ground
breaking stage in the next financial year. Prominent among
these construction projects are Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan,
Chanakyapuri residential quarters, Indian Embassy
Complex in Kathmandu/Muscat/Brasilia/Abuja/Warsaw/
Beijing/Islamabad/Kabul/ Tashkent and Bangkok. In
addition, re-development project in Singapore and
construction of apartments in London may also reach
construction stage during 2006-07. AALCO construction
project is in final stages of completion and separately
partial completion of Foreign Service Institution Complex
is being attempted in the current Financial year.
The Ministry has adopted a two pronged approach for
construction and acquisition of properties abroad and in

India with a view to bring down Ministrys rental liability.
Mindful of higher rentals being paid at some stations
abroad and considering favorable conditions for purchase
of properties in certain stations, a list of priority stations
has been worked out for acquisition of properties in next
few years. In the current financial year, Embassy
Residence-cum-Chancery in Ulaanbataar has been
purchased and financial approval has been obtained for
purchase of additional Chancery building in Paris and for
a plot for Chancery construction in Georgetown.
Acquisition proposals for purchase of properties for
Embassy Residences in Tehran, Caracas and Buenos Aires
are under active consideration. Ministry is also examining
proposals for acquisition of plot of land at Nairobi and
Addis Ababa.
The allocation of Rs. 66.41 crore in B.E. 2005-2006 under
Capital Outlay stands fully utilized and an additional of
Rs. 42 crores has been granted in the 2nd Batch for
Supplementary Demands for Grants. Based on realistic
assessment of progress in various construction projects
and acquisition proposals, a substantial hike in budgetary
allocation in Capital Outlay has been sought in Financial
Year 2006-2007.

Implementation of Official Language
Policy and Propagation of Hindi Abroad

The Ministry of External Affairs is making all efforts

towards implementing the Official Language Policy of the
Government of India and for the promotion and
propagation of Hindi in its offices, including in Indian
Missions/Posts abroad. Further, the Ministry plays an
important role promoting and propagating Hindi abroad
through Indian Missions/Posts.
Documents like Bilateral Treaties, Agreements,
Memoranda of Understanding, Credentials, Speeches of
President, PAC paragraphs, Annual Report of the Ministry
and Parliament Questions submitted to both the Houses
of Parliament are issued bilingually. Hindi forms an integral
part of the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) training
programmes. Intensive training on Governments Official
Language policy and its implementation (Rules and
Regulations) was given to the fresh trainees in their
departmental training programme. The Parliamentary
Committee on Official Language inspects Regional
Passport Offices from time to time.
For promotion and propagation of Hindi abroad, the
Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) deputes
visiting Hindi Professors to the 12 Chairs maintained in
various foreign Universities/Institutions abroad. Indian
Cultural Centres have been set up in many countries,
which work towards promotion and propagation of Hindi.
A World Hindi Secretariat is being set-up in Mauritius
with the active support of India. Its Governing Council
and Executive Board have been formed and its first
meeting will be held once a Secretary General is
nominated by Mauritius and the Deputy Secretary
General by India.
Indian Missions/Posts abroad encourage foreign nationals
to learn Hindi, for which local Hindi learning classes are

organized. Local organizations engaged in promotion and
teaching of Hindi abroad are supported financially by
Missions/Posts abroad as well as through donation of
textbooks, dictionaries, audio-visual cassettes, computer
software, CD-ROMs, Hindi magazines and childrens
literature. Special Hindi learning kits have also been
provided to Missions/Posts, which are in great demand.
Missions/Posts assist in the learning of Hindi through
correspondence courses conducted by Central Hindi
Directorate as well as encourage foreign nationals to apply
for scholarships to learn Hindi at the Kendriya Hindi
Sansthan, Agra.
To encourage use of Hindi abroad, on national days, the
Presidents address to the Nation is read out in Hindi by
most Missions/Posts abroad. Cultural programmes in
Hindi are also organized with the participation of local
members of Indian community. Literary events, essay
competitions and Kavi Sammelans are organized by
Missions/Posts, apart from celebration of Hindi Divas.
Some Indian Missions also publish Hindi magazines. From
time to time, Hindi Conferences are organized abroad to
propagate Hindi abroad. A regional Hindi Conference of
Asia Pacific countries was organised at Sydney (Australia)
on 4 & 5 February 2006 and ways of promoting the
language in the region was discussed. Panels of Hindi
interpreters have also been set-up in 32 countries to
interpret from the local language to Hindi and vice-versa.
A high level Committee, under the Chairmanship of
Minister of State for External Affairs has been
reconstituted on the introduction of Hindi as a Language
in the United Nations. Efforts are underway to prepare
an Advocacy Paper and constructive meetings have been
held in this regard by the Committee.
