upkeep of Sikh Gurudwaras and Hindu temples in Pakistan; the treatment of Indian
pilgrims visiting shrines in Pakistan; and, the enhancement of mutually beneficial
trade. Prime Minister focused on terrorism being promoted in the State of Jammu &
Kashmir, and conveyed in clear terms that India had the resolve, strength and stamina
to counter terrorism and violence until it is decisively crushed.
In his presentations, President Musharraf focussed almost exclusively on Jammu
& Kashmir and re-stated well-known Pakistani positions on Jammu & Kashmir.
The Indian side worked very hard to bridge the vast differences that existed in
our respective approaches to bilateral relations, and to arrive at a draft joint document
that would move India-Pakistan relations forward. India made proposals for the
structure of a future dialogue process on all issues, including meetings at official,
Ministerial and Summit levels. Proposals were also made to address the issues of
Peace & Security-including nuclear and conventional CBMs, Jammu & Kashmir,
terrorism, and on the other subjects of the Composite Dialogue. Eventually, however,
this quest for a joint document had to be abandoned because of Pakistans insistence
on the settlement of the Jammu & Kashmir issue as a precondition for the
normalization of relations. Pakistan was also reluctant to acknowledge and address
cross border terrorism, which it sponsors in India.
Pakistan Sponsored Terrorism
Soon after the Agra Summit, Pakistan extended formal invitations to PM and
EAM to visit Pakistan. However, a series of terrorist attacks in Jammu & Kashmir
including the massacre of Hindu pilgrims (3 August) and the attack on the Jammu
Railway Station (7 August), served to underscore the fact that though Pakistan
professed a desire for dialogue in public, it was continuing to sponsor cross-border
terrorism in India. It was thus obvious that Pakistan was unwilling to give up its
strategy of confrontation, violence and deception, while dealing with India.
The terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September, radically changed
international perceptions on state sponsored terrorism. Pakistan was compelled to
join the international campaign against terrorism in Afghanistan. Many media
analysts noted the intense international pressure that was brought to bear on Pakistan
before it finally agreed to join the international campaign against terrorism. While
it joined the international coalition, Pakistan sought to maintain its policy of

Annual Report 2001-2002
sponsoring terrorism in India unchanged. In an address to the Pakistan nation, the
President of Pakistan sought to justify his decision to join the international coalition
against terrorism in Afghanistan on the grounds that this was the only way Pakistan
would be able to protect its so-called Kashmir cause. During this time, Pakistan
based terrorist also continued to conduct terrorist attacks in J&K. On 1 October,
terrorists from the Pakistan based Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) attacked the J&K State
Assembly. Later in the month a similar desperate attempt was made against the
Awantipura Airforce Station. Both these attacks were successfully foiled.
However, the abortive terrorist attack against Parliament on 13 December, by
elements of the Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and JeM, was undoubtedly the
most audacious, as also the most alarming act of terrorism in the nearly two decades
long history of Pak-sponsored terrorism in India. This time, the Pakistan based
terrorists and their mentors across the border had the temerity to try and wipe out
the entire political leadership of India. Much thought and reflection have been given
as to why Pakistan based terrorist groups and their mentors decided to raise the
stakes so high, even while Pakistan was still professing its support to the international
coalition against terrorism. The only answer that satisfactorily addresses this query
is that Pakistan-a product of the indefensible Two Nation Theory, a theocratic state
with an extremely tenuous traditions of democracy- is unable to reconcile itself
with the reality of a secular, democratic, self confident and steadily progressing
India, whose standing in the international community is getting inexorably higher
with the passage of time.
The 13 December attack against Parliament, as also the 11 September attacks in
the United States, have shown that no country can afford to tolerate terrorism any
longer. The Prime Minister in his address to the nation on 13 December 2001 declared
that Indias fight against terrorism has now entered a decisive phase. Those behind
the attack on Parliament would be shown that the Indian people are united and
determined to stamp out terrorism from the country once and for all.
On 14 December, it was conveyed to Pakistan, through their High Commissioner
in New Delhi, that India expected Pakistan to take action against the two terrorist
organizations, based in Pakistan, who were responsible for the attack on Parliament.
Pakistan was also reminded that under international law it was obliged to take such
action. However, the Pakistani authorities continued to show a complete lack of

concern, even going to the extent of making the absurd suggestion that the attack
was organized by Indias intelligence agencies to discredit Pakistan. In view of this
lack of concern, on 21 December, India announced that it had decided to recall its
High Commissioner from Islamabad, and would also suspend the services of the
Samjhauta Express and the Delhi-Lahore bus service from 1 January 2002.
Despite these steps, Pakistan still failed to grasp the seriousness with which
India viewed the attack on her Parliament, and the rejection by the entire crosssection of our countrys opinion of Pakistans sponsorship of cross border terrorism
and its promotion of terrorism as an instrument of state policy. In view of this
Government announced, on 27 December, some further measures. This included a
reduction of the strengths of the respective High Commissions in the two countries
by 50per cent; a restriction on the movement of officials of the Pakistan High
Commission in New Delhi and their family members, to the municipal limits of Delhi;
and, the suspension of over flight facilities to Pakistan or Pakistan Airlines from 1
January 2002. On 31 December, India also handed over to Pakistan, a list of 20 fugitives
from law that had received safe haven in that country, and indicated that we expected
Pakistan to take action to apprehend them and extradite them back to India.
Additional troops were also moved along the AGPL, LoC and the International
Boundary in order to prevent further infiltration of terrorists into India.
On 12 January 2002, the President of Pakistan announced that he would start
initiating action against terrorist groups operating in Pakistan, and that henceforth
would not allow Pakistan territory to be used for terrorism anywhere in the world,
including in Jammu & Kashmir. In a statement issued by the Minister of External
Affairs (13 January 2002), India welcomed the newly declared commitment of Pakistan
President, and asked that this commitment must also be extended to include all
territories under Pakistans control today. It was also stated, that India would assess
the effectiveness of this commitment only by the concrete action Pakistan took on
the ground. In this regard, India expected Pakistan to stop all infiltration across the
International Boundary and the Line of Control, take steps to end the funding and
financing of terrorist groups in Pakistan, and ensure that the daily cycle of terrorist
violence in J&K and other parts of India, be brought to an end.
In the 13 January statement, India also reiterated its firm commitment to a
bilateral dialogue process with Pakistan in accordance with the Simla Agreement
9

India's Neighbours
and the Lahore Declaration. It noted that should the Government of Pakistan
operationalize its newly stated commitment to eradicate cross border terrorism, we
will respond fully, and would be prepared to resume the composite dialogue process.
Indias position on Pakistan sponsored cross border terrorism has received widespread
support from the international community, which accepts that there can be no
justification for terrorism and that terrorism must be eradicated wherever it exists.
Release of Fishermen
196 Indian Fishermen who were in Pakistani custody since March/April 2001
were released by the Government of Pakistan on 30 October 2001. Out of them, 155
were repatriated on 30 October while the remaining 41 were repatriated on 2
November 2001. Another 48 Indian fishermen with 8 boats were released by Pakistan
on 9 December and were repatriated to India on 10 December 2001.
India released and repatriated 202 Pakistani fishermen on 3 December 2001.
With this, India has repatriated a total of 362 Pakistani fishermen during this year.
Pakistan has released a total of 403 Indian fishermen during the year 2001.
Sikh Jathas
The Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines 1974, inter-alia provides for the visit
of four Sikh Jathas to Pakistan each year. Until 1998, SGPC was regularly taking four
Jathas to Pakistan on the occasions of Baisakhi (April), Martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev
Ji (May-June), Barsi of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (June-July) and the Birth Anniversary of
Guru Nanak Dev Ji (November).
During the current year, first official Jatha consisting of about 1800 pilgrims
visited Pakistan in April on the occasion of Baisakhi. The second Jatha of about 600
pilgrims visited Pakistan from 18-27 May 2001 on the occasion of Martyrdom Day of
Guru Arjan Devji. The third Jatha of about 260 pilgrims was sent by SGPC from 18-29
June 2001 on the occasion of Barsi of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. On the occasion of Guru
Nanak Dev's Birthday celebrations, about 2,200 Sikhs pilgrims left for Pakistan on 27
November 2001.

SAARC
The long overdue Eleventh Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
10

Cooperation was held from 4-6 January 2002 at Kathmandu. The Summit was attended
by the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs. Foreign Secretary and
other senior officers from the Ministry and Prime Minister's Office also attended. All
other Heads of State/Government from SAARC member States also participated. The
Summit was preceded by the meetings of the Programming Committee, Standing
Committee and the Council of Ministers from 28 December 2001 to 3 January 2002.
The final Kathmandu Declaration that came out of the 11th Summit is a well balanced
document that covers all areas of interest and concern to SAARC. The Ministry was
specially satisfied that many of Indias view points on crucial items including the
economic agenda, the social issues of poverty etc. and on terrorism got reflected
adequately in the final Declaration. Important items deliberated during the Summit
are as below:
(i) Poverty Alleviation - The Summit expressed its firm resolve to tackle the problem
of poverty by actively promoting the synergetic partnership among national
governments, international agencies, private sectors and civil society. It was
agreed that a special session at the Ministerial level should undertake a
comprehensive review of the status of implementation of poverty eradication
policies and programmes carried out thus far, and to recommend further concrete
measures to enhance operation at the regional level to the Twelfth SAARC
Summit. It was also agreed to reconstitute the Independent South Asian
Commission on Poverty Alleviation to review the progress made and suggest
appropriate effective measures on poverty alleviation.
(ii) Economic Cooperation - The Heads of State/Government agreed to accelerate
cooperation in the core areas of trade, finance and investment leading to a
South Asian Economic Union step-by-step. It was agreed to hold the Fourth
round of trade negotiations under SAPTA, the meeting of the Inter-governmental
Group on Trade Liberalization and to finalize the draft treaty framework for
SAFTA by the end of 2002. Keeping in view the vast tourism potential of the
region, it was agreed to take measures to promote South Asia as a common
tourist destination through joint efforts such as upgrading of infrastructure,
air linkages, simplification and harmonization of administrative procedures. It
was also agreed to implement the SAARC Environment Plan of Action.

Annual Report 2001-2002
(iii) Cooperation in the Social Sector - The Summit signed the SAARC Convention
on Preventing and Combating the Trafficking in Women and Children for
Prostitution and Convention on Regional Arrangements for the Promotion of
Child Welfare. The need to finalise the SAARC Social Charter including important
areas of poverty eradication, population stabilization, empowerment of women,
youth mobilization, human resource development and promotion of health and
nutrition, fight against disease, literacy etc. was reiterated. The Council of
Ministers decided to defer for the time being consideration of enlargement of
the Visa Exemption Scheme. The encouragement to people-to-people contact
was also recognized by the Summit.
(iv) Terrorism - The Heads of State/Government were convinced that terrorism, in
all its forms and manifestations is a challenge to all states and humanity at
large and cannot be justified on ideological, political, religious or any other
ground. The leaders agreed that terrorism violates the fundamental value of
the United Nations and the SAARC Charter and constitutes one of the most
serious threats to international peace and security in the twenty-first century.
It was unanimously recognized that there is a distinct link between terrorism,
drug trafficking, money laundering and other trans-national crimes. The
commitment was reaffirmed to accelerate the enactment of enabling domestic
legislation within a definite time frame for the full implementation of the already
signed SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism.
(v) UN and other International Agencies - The Heads of State/Government reiterated
their firm support for the principles and purposes of the United Nations in
order to create a just, balanced and equitable world order. The need to take
appropriate measures to make international financial institutions at the global
trading regime more responsive to the needs and concerns of the developing
countries was emphasized.
(vi) In addition, the Summit discussed the report of the Group of Eminent Persons.
As per rotation, the next Summit will be hosted by Pakistan tentatively in early
2003. The appointment of Mr. Q.A.M.A. Rahim from Bangladesh as the next
SAARC Secretary General was approved.
Though there was a gap of three and a half years between the Tenth Summit

(July 1998) and the Eleventh Summit (Jan 2002), the activities under SAARC continued

ndias relations with the countries in South-East Asia have traditionally
been close and warm because of a common historical legacy, cultural
affinities and, of late, economic and commercial interaction. The termination of
the cold war and the liberalization of Indian economy beginning in the early 90s,
culminated in the Look East Policy which further extended and diversified Indias
relations with the ASEAN region. This policy was translated into a number of high
level visits taking place from both the sides. The Prime Minister visited Malaysia in
May 2001 and was scheduled to visit Australia and Singapore in October this year.
Unfortunately, these visits had to be postponed because of the terrorist attack on
the World Trade Centre in New York on 11 September 2001. These visits along with
a visit to Australia for the CHOGM Summit in Brisbane is likely to take place in
March 2002. During the period under report the Thai Prime Minister Dr. Thaksin
Shinawatra visited India in November 2001, and our Vice President visited Vietnam
and Indonesia in June this year. In addition, there were number of other visits from
both sides at ministerial and at senior official levels.
Indias relationship with ASEAN which was initiated in 1992 when India was
accepted as a Sectoral Dialogue Partner, matured into a Full Dialogue Partnership in
1996 along with our membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) . During the
period under report, it has been indicated during the Brunei ASEAN Summit held in
November 2001 that there was a consensus among the ASEAN countries that a
summit level meeting should take place between ASEAN and India. This upgrading
of our interaction with the ASEAN is a very positive development in our relationship
with South-East Asia.

Bilateral trade between India and ASEAN, which had reached a high of US$ 7.35
billion in 1999-2000, came down marginally to US$ 6.96 billion in 2000-01. Though
there was an increase in Indian exports to ASEAN by about 30 per cent, the lower
imports, especially in the commodity sector brought down the volume of trade.
However, during the first four months (April  July 2001) of the current financial
year, trade has picked up again from US$ 2.17 billion, for the corresponding period
last year, by 2.46 per cent to reach US$ 2.46 billion. Indias exports during this period
has increased by about 21 per cent whereas Indias imports from ASEAN have
increased by about 9 per cent. However, India's trade with South Pacific Islands
which had reached US$ 1.62 billion in 2000-01 is showing a marginally declining
trend during first four months of the current financial year.
With Australia and New Zealand, the momentum generated by renewal of
friendly relationship last year was continued. The Minister of External Affairs (EAM)
visited Australia and New Zealand in June 2001, the first stand alone visit by an
Indian Foreign Minister to these countries in the last two decades. EAM had the
inaugural meeting of Ministerial Level Framework Dialogue with Australian Foreign
Minister Downer and the two countries had set up a Strategic Dialogue at official
level, the inaugural session of which was held in August 2001. There were also a
number of Ministerial Level visits between India and these two countries during the
period under report.
India continued its cordial and friendly relations with South Pacific Island
countries with the exception of Fiji where the internal developments continued to
13

South East Asia and the Pacific

have an impact on our relationship even after the post-election period when Mr.
Mahendra Chaudhry was bypassed both for a partnership in the Government and
for the status of leader of the opposition. While there were no high level visits in
case of other South Pacific Island countries, regular contacts were maintained at
diplomatic level and also at the meetings of international and multilateral fora.

Australia
Bilateral relations between India and Australia were further consolidated with
a number of Ministerial and other high level visits taking place from India and from
Australia.
The Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) was held in Canberra on 26 April, which was
led by Secretary (West), Shri R.S. Kalha from the Indian side and Secretary, Department
of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Dr. Ashton Calvert from the Australian side.
Minister of Information Technology and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Pramod
Mahajan led an IT delegation to Australia in April and held discussions with his
counterpart, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts,
Senator Richard Alston. An MoU between NASSCOM and the Australian Information
Industry Association (AIIA) was also signed.
Shri Pramod Mahajan also led a goodwill delegation of Parliamentary Whips in
May 2001. The delegation had joint meetings with the President of the Senate, Senator
Margaret Reid and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Neil Andrew and
met members of the Australia-India Parliamentary Group.
India-Australia relations received new momentum with the visit of Minister of
External Affairs and Raksha Mantri, Shri Jaswant Singh to Australia in June 2001.
During the first stand alone bilateral visit over two decades by an Indian Foreign
Minister, the India-Australia Foreign Ministerial Framework Dialogue was launched.
During this dialogue, a range of activities of mutual interest were identified. The
highlight was the announcement to hold a Security Dialogue which was later held
in New Delhi on 30 August 2001. This was preceded by Track II diplomacy in the
form of an Australia-India Security Round Table in New Delhi in July between the
Australian Defence Studies Centre and the Centre for the Study of National Security,
Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Defence relations which were suspended in the aftermath of 1998 nuclear tests
have resumed with the repositioning of Defence Attaches after a gap of 3 years.
Defence Secretary, Shri Yogendra Narain visited Australia in September, as a follow
up of EAM and RMs meeting with Defence Minister Mr. Peter Reith in June 2001.
A large delegation of Members of Parliament and Assembly speakers from
different states led by Lok Sabha Speaker, Shri G.M.C. Balayogi and Deputy Speaker,

The Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Dr. C. Rangarajan visited Australia in November
2001 to deliver the K.R. Narayanan oration on Monetary Policy in a Developing
Country - The Case of India. The oration was held at the Australian South Asian
Research Centre (ASARC) of the Australian National University and included a message
from President K.R. Narayanan, which was read out by the High Commissioner of
India, Shri R.S. Rathore. Simultaneously ASARC also held a seminar on Ten Years of
Economic Reforms in India.
At the academic level, Canberra University South Asia Group, School of Creative
Communication and Culture Studies held an India Update Seminar in October which
was supported by the Australia-India Council and the High Commission of India on
the theme of Shared Heritage: the Common Ground. The India-Australia Council
continued to support a wide range of activities in India and Australia, thus, promoting
bilateral links in the fields of business, education, social sector, culture, sports and
media.
Indias bilateral trade with Australia continued to decline marginally. During
the first four months of the current financial year our exports to Australia have
come down from US$ 158.26 million to US$ 142.53 million whereas our imports
have also declined from US$ 410 million to US$ 402.8 million during the first four

Annual Report 2001-2002
months of the current financial year i.e., April to July 2001, when compared to the
corresponding figures in 2000-01.

Brunei has extended its full support to our candidates seeking elections to the
posts in the ECOSOC, ICAO and ILC.

The Indian Delegation to the CHOGM 2002, which was held from 2-5 March,
was led by the Minister of External Affairs Shri Jaswant Singh.

A 5-member Parliamentary Delegation from India led by Shri Mohammad
Anwarul Haque, MP, visited Brunei from 1-3 February 2002 to brief the Brunei
dignitaries about the situation in South Asia and India's continued efforts in the war
against terrorism. The delegation had meetings with the Sultan of Brunei, Foreign
Minister, Home Minister, etc. Prime Minister of India is likely to visit Brunei in April
2002.

Brunei
Bilateral relations with Brunei Darussalam continued to be cordial and friendly.
Ongoing efforts were sustained for further upgradation of bilateral relations and
cooperation. Indias interactions with Brunei in bilateral as well as regional and
international fields have been marked by friendship and mutual understanding.
Important areas of our interactions were Science and Technology, Sports and
Culture.
India participated in the 6th ASEAN Science & Technology Week organized in
Brunei from 17-21 September 2001. Seven scientists and two officials from Technology
Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), Department of Science &
Technology, New Delhi, participated in the event The Indian scientists took part in
the ASEAN Science Congress held in Brunei during the Science & Technology Week
and presented papers on various themes such as biotechnology, food science and
technology, marine science and technology, material science and technology,
meteorology and geophysics, microelectronics and information technology, nonconventional energy research, science and technology, infrastructure and resources
development and space technology and applications.
In the field of sports, Indias national football team visited Brunei to play the
pre-world cup 2002 qualifying matches from 9-13 May 2001. An Indian contingent
of 30 athletes (15 boys and 15 girls) accompanied by 10 officials led by Minister of
Public Works of Rajasthan, Shri Rajinder Mirdha visited Brunei to take part in the
9th Asian Amateur Junior Athletic Championships from 18-22 July 2001.
A 20-member Magic Troupe led by Shri P.C. Sorcar Jr. visited Brunei from 4-10
October 2001. Three shows were organised by the mission in cooperation with Brunei
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Royal Brunei Airlines. Bruneian response to the shows
was enthusiastic.

Cambodia
The Indo-Cambodia relations scaled a new height with the visit of the Vice
President of India, Shri Krishan Kant, to Cambodia from 2-5 June 2001. The State
visit commenced with a stopover in the fabled temples of Angkor Wat. After visiting
the temples, the Vice President, in an exchange of views with King Norodom Sihanouk
and Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen, expressed Indias readiness to associate with
the renovation of more temples in the Angkor area, in response to their request.
Other important topics including Cambodias support for Indias membership in an
expanded Security Council, Summit level association of India with ASEAN, SouthSouth co-operation and enhanced ITEC assistance to Cambodia were discussed. The
Vice President announced increases in training slots under the ITEC from 30 to 40 in
civil training, and from 5 to as many as 21 in the military training for Cambodians.
The gesture was deeply appreciated.
Cambodia has consistently supported India for membership of numerous world
bodies inside and outside of UN.

Fiji
Internal developments in Fiji continued to concern India. While elections did
take place in Fiji, the establishment of a constitutional Government in the country is
still awaited.

15

South East Asia and the Pacific
After the Court of Appeal ruling in March 2001 upholding Fijis 1997 Constitution,
elections were held from 25 August to 1 September 2001. The elections were
monitored by observers from the UN, Commonwealth and ACP-EU. Caretaker Prime
Minister, Mr. Laisenia Qarases SDL party emerged with the largest number of seats,
32 in a House of 71. Mr. Mahendra Chaudhrys Labour Party won the second largest
number with 27 seats.
While international observers were of the view that although the elections were
not perfect, and Mr. Chaudhry even alleged rigging, the elections reflected the wishes
of the people. Mr. Qarase was appointed the Prime Minister, but the provisions of
the Constitution providing for power-sharing and the formation of a multiparty
Cabinet with proportionate representation of parties with at least 10 per cent of the
seats in the House was overlooked. The Labour Party, which was the only other
party with over 10 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives, was not
included in the Qarase government. In another apparent disregard of the Constitution,
some Labour party nominees for the Senate were also overlooked by the government.
Both these matters are presently before the courts in Fiji.
The Commonwealth decided to maintain status quo regarding Fijis readmission
into the Councils of the Commonwealth. The Government of India would like to see
Fiji returning to constitutional democracy. Only under a constitutional set up that
assures equal political, economic and social rights to all its citizens, can there be
peace and stability in that country.
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Harare Declaration (CMAG),
in its meeting on 20 December 2001, decided that in view of the progress made so
far in restoring democracy in Fiji, the country's suspension from the Councils of the
Commonwealth would be lifted. The CMAG, however, decided to keep Fiji on its
agenda pending ruling of the court on constitutionality of Prime Minister Qarase's
Cabinet. The court case is coming up for hearing in February 2002.
The Government of India would like to see Fiji returning to constitutional
democracy. It is only under a constitutional set up that the country would be able to
look after the interests of all sections of its society, including those of people of
Indian origin.

16

Indonesia
With Indonesia, the largest among the ASEAN countries, India has much in
common : cultural diversity, large populations, and an economic agenda that focuses
on development. India-Indonesia relations during this period have been marked by
traditional warmth and mutual understands.
President Abdurrahaman Wahids 18-month rule brought new momentum to
the relationship between India and Indonesia. During his Presidency, exchange of
visits at the highest level followed by several Ministerial visits opened new avenues
for cooperation. Elevation of Vice President Megawati to the Presidency on 24 July
2001 continued to give the necessary support in enhancing and consolidating Indias
relationship with Indonesia. Her Government has shown keen interest in
collaborating with India in a number of fields, in particular, science & technology,
education and pharmaceuticals.
The Vice President Shri Krishan Kant led an Indian delegation to Indonesia for
the G-15 Summit in May 2001. Minister of State for External Affairs Shri U.V. Krishnam
Raju accompanied the Vice President. Minister of State for Small Scale and Medium
Industries, Smt. Vasundhara Raje visited Indonesia in May (25 & 26 May) as a Keynote Speaker in the G-15 Seminar on small-scale and medium industries. Minister of
Telecommunication, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, visited Indonesia in May 2001 (14-17
May) to participate in the Second Asia Pacific Telecommunication and Information
Technology Forum and Exhibition. Indonesian Minister for Industry and Trade, Mr.
Luhut Panjaitan, visited India on 23 & 24 April.
EAM met the Foreign Minister of Indonesia (FMI) in New York, on the sidelines
of 56th UNGA on 14 November 2001. EAM thanked FMI for Indonesian support to
the proposal for ASEAN-India Summit Dialogue. FMI referred to the proposal for a
visit by President Megawati to India next year stating that she attaches a significant
importance to this visit. He also stated that there is a great potential for cooperation
between India and Indonesia in many areas including trade. EAM responded stating
that we are looking forward to the visit. He also reminded FMI of his own visit to
India due for the Joint Commission Meeting. EAM added that we are committed to

Central Asia

I

ndias relations with Central Asia are historical, traditional and deep-rooted.
Over the centuries, free flow of cultural influences and interaction between the
peoples of this region and India, resulted in some of the greatest achievements
of mankind including in such areas as architecture, music, cuisine and literature.
The enormous mutual goodwill at the people to people level was unique with few
parallels.

Azerbaijan

Independence of these countries in 1991 meant new opportunities. Common
adherence to secularism and pluralism and also complementarities of economies
and resources made Indias partnership with the countries of this region a natural
one. At the same time, while the physical distances were relatively small, a zone of
instability separates India from this region. During the recent years, there has been
a realization that the same forces threaten India and Central Asia in the form of
religion-based fundamentalism, cross-border terrorism and narcotics.

There is considerable potential for economic cooperation including in the area
of energy. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) commissioned a 70 MW hydroelectric power generator in Mingechevir in May 2001.

While the recent recognition of the threat posed by global terrorism has brought
the region into international focus, Indias relations with Central Asia have an
enduring character. Apart from immediate common security concerns, as difficulties
associated with the transitional nature of these economies are dealt with, and also
innovative solutions found to address problems associated with landlocked
economies, and there is freer flow of information, mutually beneficial relations with
Central Asia can be expected to make a quantum leap from existing levels. There is
a perceptible consensus and determination to forge a fruitful partnership.

India and Azerbaijan have a common interest in further strengthening and

frica continued to occupy a special place in our diplomatic interaction. Indias
relationship with this important continent, which constitutes the largest
bloc of countries in the United Nations, has been built on the strong political
foundations of the past. The challenge today is to give even greater economic content
to this historic relationship taking into account new and emerging opportunities.
As always, a significant feature of Indias interaction with Africa was the sustained
high level of bilateral exchanges. Indeed, in reinforcing people to people contacts,
these exchanges with an increasingly democratic Africa constitute a growing area
of interaction.

Mauritius
There is hardly any aspect of bilateral and multilateral relationship that is left
untouched in the wide gamut of excellent relations between India and Mauritius.
These wide-ranging relations nevertheless received a new momentum.

Economic relations between Mauritius and India were further strengthened
with the signature of a line of credit of US $100 million to be used for the
establishment of a Cyber city and promotion of Information Technology. Trade

Transport, Communications and Information Technology. He also met the captains
of Indian industry at a lunch organized by the FICCI and CII in Bangalore.

Seychelles
India has an important link with Seychelles in the form of Indian nationals
working in Seychelles. Large construction companies owned by Seychellois of Indian
origin employ hundreds of construction workers on contract. Direct air links between
India and Seychelles are just about to be resumed. Seychelles has over the years
been extending valuable support to India at the international fora and in turn, on
more than one occasion, Seychelles has turned to India in times of need. We tried to
accommodate their needs within our constraints. Minister of State for Home Affairs,
Shri Vidyasagar Rao led a 4-member delegation to Mahe (8-12 October) to undertake
a study of island tourism. During a meeting with the visiting Indian dignitary, Foreign

membership. Indian Navy training ships Tir and Krishna visited Port Victoria (22-25
October) on a goodwill visit. Indo-Seychelles Defence Forces Joint training during
end-November evoked considerable interest in the field of defence co-operation.

The visit of Minister of State for Commerce & Industry to Kenya to co-chair the
Joint Trade Committee marked the continuing importance India placed on Kenya as
a partner in commercial and economic fields, both bilaterally and regionally.
On the education front, visits to India by the Vice Chancellor of the United
States International University (USIU) and the holding of an Indian Educational Fair
by Ed.CIL in Nairobi cemented institutional linkages. The Kenya-Indian Friendship

between India and Tanzania taking India to the position of one of the largest trading
partners of Tanzania. There has also been an encouraging trend for collaboration in
the field of manufacturing and technology-based service sectors. Agriculture, smallscale industries, agro-processing, pharmaceuticals, health care, oil and gas
exploration, information technology and HRD have been identified as priority areas
for cooperation. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed to promote further
cooperation in the Small and Medium Enterprises sector. India also announced a
decision to set up a Small Industries Centre in Dar-es-Salaam.

Ethiopia
The preoccupation of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic
Front with its internal organisational reforms had somewhat affected the
Governments efforts in enhancing its relationships with other countries including
India. India contributed 1,366 troops and other staff to the United Nations Mission
in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) which is monitoring the cease fire agreement
between the two countries. India is the largest contributor of troops to UNMEE.
However, in spite of an unstable political situation in that country, Indian companies
continued to secure contracts e.g. M/s Rail India Technical and Economic Services
and Consulting Engineering Services for road consultancy projects, M/s Kalpataru
Power Transmission Ltd. and M/s Jyoti Structures Ltd. for power transmission projects,
WAPCOS for integrated water resources project. State Bank of India is also in the

trade continues to be in Indias favour.

South Africa
A Strategic Partnership forms the basis of Indias bilateral relations with South
Africa. While there has been a steady increase in the volume of trade and commerce
between the two countries, co-operation in important areas likes defence, health,
mining and housing & public works continued to the mutual benefit of both the
countries. The South African Ministers of Public Works; Health and Mines visited
New Delhi in May, July and November respectively.
There are many ongoing dialogues between India and South Africa for
establishment of projects with transfer of technology, joint production etc.- all aimed
at long-term defence industrial production. Exchange of training programmes
between the two countries defence forces are also continuing. Major Indian
pharmaceutical companies manufacturing anti-retroviral drugs have registered their
products in South Africa. This will definitely help those companies to supply their
formulations to other Sub-Saharan African countries.
The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), jointly with the High Commission of
India in South Africa, organized a Made in India Show in Johannesburg (18-21 July).
Over 70 Indian companies participated in that Show. The CII also organised a
Enterprise India exhibition of Indian small and medium enterprises, products and
services, at Durban (19-21 September).

Sam Nujoma. Minister of State for Small Scale Industries, Government of India, Smt.
Vasundhara Raje visited Namibia, specially invited by the Namibian Minister of Trade
& Industry, to be present during the inauguration of this exhibition. Her visit, coming
as it did after a gap of over 3 years when Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
visited Namibia in 1998, proved to be an important milestone in the bilateral relations
between the two countries.
The Namibian position on Kashmir as well as Indias candidature for permanent
membership of the UN Security Council has been very supportive.
The Namibian Secretary to the Cabinet, Mr. Frans Kapofi, led a three member
delegation to India from 10-14 December 2001 mainly with the objective of studying
the Cabinet system in India, the functioning of the Civil Service and the Public Service
Management System. During his visit, Mr. Kapofi called on Minister of State for
Small Scale Industries & ARI, Smt. Vasundhara Raje, in addition to his meeting with
the Cabinet Secretary, Secretary (ER), Chairman of the Union Public Service
Commission and Secretary (Heavy Industry).

Mozambique
Ms. Aida N. Libombo, Vice Minister of Health, visited India (5-15 July) as a guest
of the Indian Drug Manufacturers Association. One of the immediate outcomes of

companies in the list for inviting tenders for supply of medicines/pharmaceuticals
to the Mozambican Government. Mozambique opened its High Commission in New
Delhi in the first week of December this year.

December 2001. Former President Chilubas nominated candidate of the ruling MMD
Party, Mr. Levy Mwanawasa was declared winner of the elections and was sworn in
as President of Zambia on 2 January 2002. However, the ruling party lost its majority
in the Parliament. Out of 148 constituencies, MMD candidates won only 68 seats.
Among the important opposition parties, UPND has bagged 49, FDD has secured 13
while 11 seats have gone to UNIP.

Zimbabwe
The land issue in Zimbabwe dominated the domestic politics, economy and
social life throughout the year. Undaunted by criticism and threatened by sanctions
from the western countries led by the USA and EU, the Government of Zimbabwe
pursued its planned land acquisition and resettlement programme. The mutual
beneficial relations between India and Zimbabwe continued despite the negative
Western perception about Zimbabwe. Though the economic climate in Zimbabwe
affected bilateral trade, Indias assistance to Zimbabwe under ITEC/SCAAP for their
human resources development continued as in the past years. Indias commitment
under G-15 forum to assist Zimbabwe in SME sector and in setting up information
technology training centre for Africa in Harare, made some progress.

Malawi
The second term in office of President Bakili Muluzi provided Malawi a certain
degree of stability and growth. Malawi is favourably disposed towards India on Indias
nuclear policy. Officials of the Malawi Electoral Commission visited India to study

this field and also gave a definitive momentum to our growing technical cooperation.

Nigeria

Ghana

The path breaking visit of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo as the Chief
Guest at the Republic Day celebrations in the very first year of the new millennium
provided a definitive momentum to the economic content of our bilateral relations
with this important west African country. India has also been extending all
cooperation in developing the nascent democratic institutions in Nigeria.

Bilateral relations between India and Ghana remained cordial and friendly during
the period under report. After the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in
December 2000, there has been a change of government in Ghana ending a twentyyears rule by Flt. Lt. Jerry John Rawlings. The new government evinced keen and
earnest desire to raise the level of our existing bilateral relations. The two countries
agreed to sign a cultural and Scientific Exchange Programme for the year 2002-2004.

During this period a four-member delegation of the Nigerian Presidential
Advisory Council on International Relations visited India (25-28 April). A Nigerian

Liberia
India and Liberia maintained cordial and friendly relations. However, owing to
the imposition of the Secondary Sanctions by the UN on this country, bilateral
interactions remained limited.

Cote d Ivoire
Relations between Cote d Ivoire and India are cordial. The military coup of
December 1999 and the political difference between the leaders have badly affected
the economic development of the country and the economy continues to shrink.
The Prime Minister of Cote d Ivoire is expected to lead a delegation to India in
January next year to seek Indian Investment and technology for their Small and
Medium enterprises, industries and agriculture.

Aid to African Countries
To foster the strong tradition of cooperation that has developed with Sub-Saharan
African countries during the last five decades, to cultivate an image of dependable
partnership in the effort towards socio-economic development and to utilize these
mechanisms to further promote Indias political and economic objectives in Africa,

Annual Report 2001-2002
we have been assisting the developing countries in this region to develop their
various economic and social infrastructure through assistance under Aid to African
Countries Fund.
India has been offering substantial aid to Burkina Faso. A Farmers Project is
currently going on in Burkina Faso with our assistance. Six Indian farmers are
teaching their Burkinabe counterparts techniques of modern farming.
As a goodwill gesture, India donated medicines to the flood victims of
Mozambique. The medicines were formally handed over to the Vice-Minister of Health
(20 September). Another donation consisting of various agricultural equipment, seeds,
mosquito nets and an ambulance to the Foundation for Community Development,
a prominent NGO in Mozambique, which is involved in community development in
the fields of education, health, water, sanitation, training, income generation etc.,
is in offing.
Assistance was also provided to Ghana by donating 25 computer sets, 250 hand
water-pumps, 200 pedestal sewing machines, 25 motor cycles, 25 mopeds and 350
bicycles. These donations have gone a long way in employment generation in the
rural areas of the country. In the same spirit, India donated five tractors to the
Liberian Ministry of Food & Agriculture.
This year when a famine-like situation was created in Eritrea as a result of a
long period of drought, our gesture in donating 200 MT of sugar and 1500 MT of
wheat to Eritrea was very much appreciated.
Democracy being our calling card abroad, consignments of indelible ink were
sent to Benin and Lesotho for use during the democratic elections in those countries.
Shri Omar Abdullah, Minister of State for External Affairs handed over a donation
of US $ 1 million to Dr. Nelson Mandela in support of the activities of the Nelson
Mandela Foundation. The Nelson Mandela Foundation set up by Dr. Mandela devotes
itself to a variety of projects for peace, stability and development in the whole of
Africa.
Assistance to Sub-Saharan African countries: A major cyclone hit Mauritius
caused extensive damage to property in January this year. Keeping in view our special
relations with Mauritius and the gesture of Mauritius in extending humanitarian
assistance after the earthquake in Gujarat last year, PM conveyed Indias willingness
to assist Mauritius at their hour of crisis. An amount of one million US dollars will be
donated to the Government of Mauritius in their reconstruction works.

India-Africa Pharma & Health Summit
A four day India-Africa Health Summit was organised at the World Trade Center,
Mumbai (26-29 September) by Ministry of Commerce & Industry and the Federation
of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry. Africa Division assisted to arrange this
Summit in a meaningful way and Indias missions in the Sub-Saharan Africa were in
touch with the concerned local business associations and the Government Ministries/
Departments in the countries of their accreditation for their participation. Highlevel Health Ministry delegations from 16 African countries participated in that
Summit. Ministers of Health from eight of these countries led their delegations.
Renowned Indian pharma and health care companies showcased Indias capabilities
in these sectors to the visiting African delegations. The Summit provided an
opportunity to the African participants to interact with leading Indian Pharma
companies and health care service providers. This also led the foundation for
sustainable partnership in the Pharma and Health Care sectors in the form of Indian
joint ventures and subsidiaries in the African countries.

Relations with the Regional Organisations in Africa:
India has been consistently supporting the objectives and activities of the OAU
since its inception in 1963. Replacing the Organisation of African Unity, a new PanAfrican body, the African Union, has formally been launched during the OAU Summit
held in Lusaka in July this year. With the formal take off of the African Union, we are
hopeful that the new body will serve the needs of the African countries in a
meaningful way in their efforts towards economic development and peace.
The drive towards regionalisation in Africa reflects the natural urge of the African
countries towards better economic and, eventually, political integration and their
seriousness in addressing the problem of market fragmentation. India is engaged in
constructing relations of partnership and cooperation with regional organizations
like the Southern African Development Community, Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa and East African Community (EAC). While there is an MoU of cooperation between India and the SADC, negotiations with the EAC as well as COMESA
Secretariat for signing Memoranda of Understanding with these important east
African regional organizations are at the final stage.

ndias relations with countries of East and Central Europe have been historically
close and traditionally warm and friendly. Cooperation with these countries is
multi-faceted in character and comprehensive in content. Political relations with
each of the countries have been problem-free. There have been significant exchanges
with all the countries in the field of science and technology and cultural exchanges
have afforded close people-to-people contacts. Despite the move by a majority of
the countries of the region to seek greater integration into Euro-Atlantic structures,
they have continued to place emphasis on traditional ties with India. Our ties were
strengthened through exchange of visits during the year 2001. Besides high level
visits, interaction at Ministerial, Parliamentary and official levels continued on a
regular basis. The high point of these exchanges was the State Visit to the Russian
Federation by the Prime Minister Shri A B Vajpayee in November 2001.
To review Indias bilateral relations with the countries in the Europe East Division
and to determine policies to give a fresh impetus to all round development of these
relations, Minister of State for External Affairs Shri Omar Abdullah presided over an
inter-ministerial discussion on 21 January 2002. He thereafter interacted on 24 January
2002 with the Heads of Missions in New Delhi of the countries covered by the Europe
East Division. Further, a Conference of the Indian Heads of Missions is scheduled to
take place in Warsaw on 23 & 24 February 2002.
Many countries in the Europe East Division condemned the terrorist attacks on
50

Indian Parliament on 13 December 2001. The messages also expressed condolences
at the loss of lives.
Trade and economic cooperation, however, has not been commensurate with
its true potential. Also one sore point in our relations with some of the Europe East
countries, especially those aspiring to become members of the European Union (EU),
continues to be the restrictive visa regimes followed by them.
Presidential and Parliamentary elections were held in many of the countries of
East and Central Europe during the year 2001. Following Presidential elections,
Mr. Vladimir Voronin assumed the office of the President of Moldova on 7 April 2001.
President Voronin thereafter appointed Mr. Vasily Tarlev as the new Prime Minister
of Moldova on 11 April 2001. Parliamentary elections were held in Montenegro in
April 2001, after which, President Milo Djukanovic swore in a coalition government
led by Prime Minister Filip Vujanovic. The Ukrainian Parliament voted out the
Government led by Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko on 26 April 2001 through a
no-confidence motion. It subsequently approved on 29 May 2001 business lobbyist
Mr. Anatoliy Kinakh as the country's new Prime Minister. Following the Parliamentary
elections held on 17 June 2001, ex-Bulgarian King, Mr. Simeon Saxe Coburg Gotha
became the Prime Minister of Bulgaria. In Albania, the incumbent Prime Minister
Ilir Meta retained his partys majority in the Parliamentary elections held on 24 June
2001. However, he resigned on 29 January 2002 after failing to resolve a party feud
that paralysed the political life and vital reforms in the country. Lithuania's Prime

Annual Report 2001-2002
Minister Rolandas Paksas resigned on 20 June 2001 after a leading political party
walked out of his coalition government. Thereafter, former President of Lithuania,
Mr. Algirdas Brazauskas, was appointed as the new Prime Minister of Lithuania on 3
July 2001. Following multiple rounds of presidential elections in the Estonian
Parliament in August 2001, Mr. Arnold Ruutel assumed the office of President on 8
October 2001. In Poland, following general elections held on 23 September 2001, a
left wing coalition formed the government under the Prime Ministership of Mr. Leszek

Addressing the nation on 13 December 2001 after the US decision to withdraw
from the 1972 ABM Treaty, President of the Russian Federation Mr. Vladimir V Putin
termed the US decision as a mistake albeit not surprising. He said that the US decision
would not pose a threat to Russian national security as it has an effective system of
missile defence. He added that despite the US announcement, the current level of
US-Russia bilateral relations should not only be sustained but must be used to speedily
work out a new framework for strategic relations. He further said the As the world
has come to face with new threats, it is essential that we prevent legislative vacuum
in the field of strategic stability. One should not undermine the mechanism that
prevent the proliferation of mass destruction weapons.

rights granted by the Macedonian Government. To oversee the disarmament process,
3500 NATO soldiers were deployed. The UN Security Council approved a peacekeeping
mission in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia after the mandate of the
NATO troops stationed there ended on 26 September 2001. The Macedonian

ethnic Albanians.
In order to make political progress in Kosovo, the United Nations Mission in
Kosovo (UNMIK) held elections in Kosovo for the 120-member provincial assembly
on 17 November 2001. After much dithering and under threat from the European
Union that aid to FRY would be stopped if elections were boycotted and belief that
not much could be gained by boycotting the elections, the Yugoslav authorities
asked the Kosovar Serbs to participate in the elections. Mr. Ibrahim Rugovas Kosovo
Democratic Alliance (LDK) emerged ahead of others polling 46.29 per cent of the
votes and winning 47 seats. On 13 December 2001 voting for electing the President
took place. Mr. Rugova, who was the only candidate, received 49 valid votes and
thus failed to cross the required threshold of 80. The election of President may take
some time till the rival parties sort out their differences and arrive at some
compromise.
In its November 2001 assessment of candidates for European Union membership,

54

and the Czech Republic formally revalidating six agreements and terminating three
other agreements. (The question of continuation of bilateral agreements between
Czechoslovakia and India became relevant in the context of Czechoslovakia splitting
into two independent successor states i.e., Czech Republic and Slovak Republic in
1992. At the time of independence, the Czech Parliament declared to fulfil all bilateral
and multilateral Agreements signed with the former Czechoslovakia and saw these
documents with equal validity for the Czech Republic also. The subject of the
continued validity of the Agreement was discussed with Czech officials. Both sides
felt that some Agreements should continue to remain in force while others need to
be terminated or replaced with new Agreements). The six agreements which have

West Europe
The year 2001 marked the consolidation of our relations with the European
Union and individual countries in Western Europe. A series of high level visits and
important events emphasized the solid foundation and greater dynamism of our
bilateral ties. The steady increase of political exchanges demonstrated Indias desire
to build a wider range of linkages with its major European partners and a
corresponding desire on their side to engage India both bilaterally and multilaterally.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September were a defining moment as they
fundamentally changed the traditional concept of power and brought International
Terrorism to the centrestage as never before. Having been a victim of terrorism for
the last two decades, India extended its support to the international coalition against
terrorism and in doing so engaged in extensive discussions with the countries in
the region. EAM visited France (28 September) and held discussions with French
Foreign Minister Mr. Hubert Vedrine in the wake of terrorist attacks. Principal
Secretary to Prime Minister visited France (27 September) for discussions with his
counterpart, Mr. Gerard Errera. EAM visited UK (3 & 4 October) where he held
discussions with Prime Minister Tony Blair, Defence Secretary Geoffrey Hoon and
55

Europe
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Jack Straw. During his
discussions in UK, which followed a few days after the attack on the J&K State
Assembly, the UK leadership conveyed outrage at these attacks. EAM held meetings
in Berlin with his counterpart, Mr. Joschka Fischer and the German Chancellor Mr.
Gerhard Schroeder.
The political dialogue was carried forward at the highest level during the visit
of Chancellor Schroeder to India (28-31 October 2001) and the visits of UK Prime
Minister Mr. Tony Blair (6 October 2001 & 4-7 January 2002). The visits of Chancellor
Schroeder in October 2001 and PM Tony Blair in January 2002 were State Visits in
response to long-standing invitations from the Indian side but assumed an added
significance in the context of the post-11 September developments. These high level
exchanges contributed significantly in deepening and strengthening of Indias
strategic partnership with two of its major European partners.
The India-EU Summit held in New Delhi on 23 November 2001 was yet another
milestone in our relationship with the European Union. EU holds summits only with
its major partners, i.e., USA, Canada, Russia, China and Japan. The institutionalization
of summit level interaction and the realization of the need for India and EU to build
of coalition of interests to meet the challenges of the 21st Century is a significant
development. Since the First Summit in Lisbon in June 2000, Indias dialogue and
cooperation with the EU has expanded and diversified in many areas. The discussions
held between Prime Minister Vajpayee and European Commission President Mr.
Romano Prodi and the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and the Joint
Communique issued during the Summit further cemented the strategic partnership
between India and the EU. The Declaration on International Terrorism adopted at
the Summit is an important document signifying the convergence of views between
India and the European Union in the global fight against this scourge of the 21st
Century.
The regular meetings of the Joint Working Groups on International Terrorism
with our major European partners, UK & France and the European Union underscored
the importance of bilateral exchange on this issue, which was at the top of the
agenda during the year. In recognition of the role played by India in international
56

efforts to combat terrorism, India was invited to be a member of the Ad hoc
Committee of the Commonwealth on Terrorism. Following the 11 September terrorist
attacks, a growing number of Western European countries emphasized the
importance of reaching an agreement and finalizing Indias draft Comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) which is being discussed in the United
Nations.
The visit of the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg to India marked
the growing engagement with the Nordic countries. The visit was significant as the
Norwegian Prime Minister publicly supported Indias candidature for permanent
membership of an expanded Security Council. With Iceland already having expressed
its support last year, the prospects of a Nordic consensus emerging on this issue
were enhanced.
In an important step forward on Indias candidature for UNSC, France publicly
declared in the UN that it believes that Germany, Japan and India are destined to
occupy a permanent seat in the Security Council. Similarly Ireland stated that on
any objective criteria India possesses the attributes for permanent membership.
Acknowledgement by the UK (another P-5 country) in the New Delhi Declaration,
signed on 6 January 2002 during PM Blairs visit that it viewed India as a natural
contender for the permanent seat in an expanded Security Council and would work
towards this end was another positive development.
Political relationship with the major European countries was strengthened by
an intensified civil society dialogue. The round tables with UK and the European
Union, the Consultative Group with the Germans and the Indo-French Forum made
valuable contribution to the growing political relationship.

France
Indias warm and friendly relations with France were enriched by regular
dialogue both at the Ministerial and official levels especially in the wake of the 11
September terrorist attacks. Minister of External Affairs (then also Defence Minister)
Mr. Jaswant Singh paid an official visit to France on 28 September at French Foreign
Ministers invitation. EAM met President Chirac, held discussions in a meeting-cum-

Annual Report 2001-2002
working lunch with Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and also met Defence Minister
Alain Richard. Principal Secretary and National Security Adviser also visited France
on 27 September on his way back from the US to hold discussions with the Personal
Representative of the French President, Gerard Errera. He also met the Chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Senate and Diplomatic Adviser to the
French President. Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Vedrine visited India on
November 1. President Chirac sent Mr. Douste Blazy, Mayor of Toulouse as his special
envoy to India on 20 & 21 December 2001.
At the official level, Foreign Secretary Mrs. Chokila Iyer and Mr. Loic Hennekinne,
Secretary General, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led the respective delegations during
the Foreign Office Consultations (2 April, New Delhi), as a part of the institutionalized
dialogue on bilateral, regional and global issues of common concern. The Seventh
Round of the Strategic Dialogue was held on 31 July to 1 August 2001 in New Delhi.
The Indian delegation was led by Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister and
National Security Advisor, Mr. Brajesh Mishra while the French delegation was led
by Mr. Gerard Errera, Personal Representative of the French President.
The first meeting of the Indo-French Joint Working Group on International
Terrorism was held in Paris on 7 September 2001, ironically a few days before the 11
September attacks on the World Trade Centre. The discussions showed a convergence
of views on the current trends in International Terrorism and provided an opportunity
to sensitise the French on Indias specific concerns in its fight against terrorism over
the last two decades. Both sides agreed on the need for early conclusion of
negotiations on Indias draft proposal on Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism. France issued strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks on the J&K
Assembly and the Indian Parliament in New Delhi on 13 December 2001 in statements
and letters communicated at the bilateral level.
The year also saw reaffirmation of support by France for Indias candidature for
a permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Expression of support at the
bilateral levels translated into public support when at the UN, French Permanent
Representative to the UN unequivocally declared in a statement on 31 October that
France believes that Germany, Japan and India are destined to occupy a permanent
seat in the Security Council.

Economic and commercial relations were marked by a number of high level
visits including that of Minister of Power Mr. Suresh P. Prabhu during 14-18 May
2001 to attend the Ministerial Meeting of the International Energy Agency and the
visit by Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mrs. Sushma Swaraj during 1317 May to attend the 54th Cannes International Film Festival. The latter also met
French Minister of Culture and Communication Mrs. Catherine Tasca. A significant
outcome was the agreement between the two sides to set up a Joint Working Group
on Films within the framework of the Indo-French Forum with a mandate to consider
all issues relating to bilateral cooperation in films, including co-productions.
Minister for Rural Development Mr. Venkaiah Naidu visited France during 18-22
July at the invitation of the European Agricultural Commission. From the French
side, French Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Mr. Jean Glavany visited India
during 14-17 September 2001. It was agreed during this visit to institutionalise
cooperation in this area through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
French Minister for Foreign Trade, Mr. Francois Huwart visited India in December
2001, for the 11th session of the Indo-French Joint Committee on Economic and
Technical Cooperation. He was accompanied by a large trade delegation from MEDEF,
the apex French Industry Association.
To continue parliamentary exchanges, a seven member French Parliamentary
delegation led by Mr. Andre Lajoinie, Chairman of National Assembly Committee on
Production and Trade visited India (11-14 September).
A comprehensive review of ongoing defence cooperation was undertaken by
Defence Secretary and Mr. Jean Bernard Ouvrieu, Special Representative of the French
Defence Minister during the Fourth meeting of the Indo-French Joint High Committee
on Defence held from 25-29 June in New Delhi. Joint Working Groups on Energy,
Telecommunications and Information Technology met during this period and
reviewed the mutually beneficial interaction in these crucial areas.
Civil society dialogue continued apace with the bilateral relationship through
the Indo-French Forum, which held its seventh meeting in Paris (18 & 19 October).
The Forum, co-chaired by Shri Ram Krishna Hegde and Francois Poncelet, agreed
that a Seminar on Secularism and Tolerance would be organized at the time of the
57

Europe
next Plenary Session in Bangalore in November 2002. It noted with satisfaction, the
progress achieved in other areas such as establishment of an Indo-French Advanced
Research Laboratory in Laser Physics at Bangalore, projects in water management,
environment and mini hydel power sector etc. A seminar on India and France in the
21st Century was organised in Paris on 20 October to coincide with the Forum meeting
and a leading French publication La Revue des Deux Mondes brought out a special
commemorative issue on India. Based on the recommendations of the Indo-French
Forum, the main highlight in the cultural field was the holding of the first ever
Picasso Exhibition in New Delhi organised within the framework of the Indo-French
Cultural Exchange Programme. The exhibition, inaugurated on 14 December 2001
at the National Museum in New Delhi, comprised of 122 masterpieces of Picasso and
is scheduled to move on to Mumbai after 31 January 2001 where it would be exhibited
at the National Gallery of Modern Art till 30 March 2002. A Colloquium on India and
France in 21st Century was held at the same time. The Forums recommendations
have been submitted to Heads of Government of both countries.

United Kingdom
The year 2001 witnessed a further consolidation of our close and friendly
relations with the United Kingdom. The Labour Partys historic win for a second
term in the general election held on 7 June 2001 provided an element of continuity
in India-UK relations. A succession of high level visits from both sides imparted
greater depth to the bilateral relationship and led to the characterisation of the
current phase of India-UK ties as being the best ever.
In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, India and the UK became
active members of the international coalition against terrorism and remained in
close consultation. EAM visited UK on 3 & 4 October 2001. Prime Minister Blairs
visit to India on 6 October and Prime Minister Vajpayees visit to the UK on 12 & 13
November enabled both sides to share views at the highest level on the evolving
situation in Afghanistan.
The sustained political dialogue with the UK reflected a greater sensitivity on
the part of UK to Indian concerns on cross border terrorism in J & K. Even prior to
the 11 September terrorist attacks, India and the UK had been cooperating closely
58

to counter international terrorism, particularly through the mechanism of the IndiaUK Joint Working Group on International Terrorism and Drug Trafficking, which
held its first meeting in Delhi in January 2001 and second meeting at the operational

asset to both countries. In the general election held on 7 June 2001 the total number
of MPs of Indian origin increased to 5.

Germany

attached to this first visit of the Head of Government since 1993. Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder was accompanied by the Economic Minister, Mr. Werner Muller, Interior
Minister, Mr. Otto Schily and Minister of State in the Foreign Office, Dr. Ludger Volmer.

the discussions held by EAM in Berlin on 4 & 5 December 2001 when he had met the
Chancellor, the German Foreign Minister Mr. Joschka Fischer and German Defence
Minister, Mr. Rudolf Scharping. German Foreign Minister condemned the 1 October

membership, Ireland stated at the UN General Assembly that on any objective
grounds India possesses the necessary attributes for permanent membership. In
the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in USA, Ireland expressed support for Indias
draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, underlining that there
was a need to go further beyond various existing international conventions on
terrorism. The remarks have added significance in view of Ireland being a nonpermanent UNSC member since 1 October 2001. Ireland announced aid amounting

successful India-EU Summit held in New Delhi on 23 November 2001. Mr. Romano

Annual Report 2001-2002
Prodi, President of the European Commission and the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr.
Guy Verhofstadt in his capacity as President of European Council, led the EU
Delegation which included ECs Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, Deputy Foreign
Minister of Belgium Ms Anmmie Nyets. The Prime Minister was assisted by Commerce
and Industry Minister, Shri Murasoli Maran, Science & Technology Minister Shri Murli
Manohar Joshi. A Joint Communiqué, Joint Declaration on Terrorism, Joint IT Vision
Statement were released and Co-operation Agreement on S&T and Financing
Agreement for Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a peoples movement for universal elementary
education were signed. Both sides expressed keen interest in expanding bilateral
trade and investment, to combat international terrorism and to work for a broadbased government in post-Taleban Afghanistan.
In addition to the political summit, given the importance of India-EU economic
relations (EU is Indias largest trading partner accounting for 26 per cent of our
exports & 25 per cent of our imports and a major source of foreign direct investments),
a Business Summit, organized jointly by Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) was held on 22
November. The Business Summit addressed by Prime Minister Vajpayee and the EU
President Mr. Romano Prodi identified bio-technology, pharmaceuticals, IT and
telecommunications and engineering as the major thrust areas for the future.
India-EU cooperation on International Terrorism was institutionalised as
envisaged in the Lisbon Declaration signed during the First Summit in June 2000
through the establishment of an India-EU Joint Working Group on Terrorism. As a
result of the setting up of this Group, India was able to articulate its concerns on
International Terrorism at the EU level in addition to exchanging views through a
similar mechanism bilaterally with two major P-5 countries in Europe  UK and
France. The first meeting chaired at the Joint Secretary level was held in Brussels on
29 May, the second meeting, after the WTC terrorist attacks and the attacks on J&K
State Legislative Assembly, showed a greater willingness on the part of EU to
understand our concerns in this area. The Declaration on Terrorism adopted during
the India-EU Summit further demonstrates the convergence of views between India
and EU in this important area.

Regular institutionalised exchanges with the EU included the India-EU Senior
Officials Meeting (1 June) during which both sides exchanged views on regional and
multilateral issues of common interest. Joint Secretary (EW) and Head of Asia,
Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sweden, Mr. Borje Ljunggren led the
respective delegations. At the Third Indo-EU Troika discussions on Consular Matters
(26 September), both sides discussed ways of reducing impediments in consular and
visa services.

the political and economic relationship with the EU. The Second Meeting of the
Round Table held in Brussels on 16-17 July 2001, was co-chaired by Director, India
International Centre, Shri N. N. Vohra from the Indian side and by President of the
Economic and Social Committee, Mr. Goke Frerichs from EU side. The substantial
outcome of the meeting, which made recommendations on exchanges in the areas
of media and culture, contribution of civil society to cope with globalisation and
other trade and investment issues, reflects the evolving strength of the new IndiaEU Strategic Partnership.
Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri Omar Abdullah and the EC
Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten inaugurated the India-EU Think
Tank Seminar held in Brussels from 15-16 October 2001. The Seminar brought together
eminent personalities from both India and from all major European countries.

The Americas

USA

I

n January 2001, Mr. George W. Bush assumed office as President of the
United States, which brought in a Republican Administration in Washington
D.C. after eight years of a Democratic Administration under President Bill Clinton.
Since assuming office, President Bush has repeatedly conveyed his commitment to
accelerating the momentum of recent years in India-U.S. relations and completing
the process of transforming the relationship.
The level of engagement in the first year of the Bush Administration has been
both broad-based and intensive. The two countries further expanded their agenda
of bilateral relations, which is increasingly cast in a global context. The wide-ranging
bilateral Dialogue Architecture, established during the visit of President Clinton in
March 2000, was resumed and expanded. Dialogue on security and strategic issues
have developed beyond non-proliferation issues to cover a wide range of international
concerns and developments. There was considerable progress in defence cooperation,
after a three-year period of limited contacts. The United States lifted the unilateral
restrictions that it had imposed in response to India's nuclear tests in May 1998,
which has paved the way for fuller development of economic, military and technology
relations between the two countries.
Although the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September made the
U.S. response to it, including the military campaign in Afghanistan, the immediate
and overwhelming focus of its foreign and security policy, the two sides maintained
the pace of bilateral engagement, both in response to the challenges arising out of

the events of 11 September and to pursue the long-term development of India-U.S.
relations. The terrorist attack on the Parliament on 13 December has further
strengthened India-U.S. cooperation against terrorism.
Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid an official working visit to
Washington D.C. at the invitation of President Bush from 7-9 November 2001. Prime
Minister and President Bush reiterated their commitment to complete the process
of qualitatively transforming India-U.S. relations in pursuit of their many common
goals in Asia and beyond. They announced a number of new initiatives for dialogue
and cooperation in the areas of defence, the New Strategic Framework and missile
defence, high technology commerce, counter-terrorism, space, nuclear energy,
bilateral economic dialogue and Afghanistan.
Shri Jaswant Singh, in his capacity as External Affairs and Raksha Mantri, visited
Washington D.C. on 5-7 April 2001 to initiate the high level political engagement
with the Bush Administration. Both during this and his subsequent visit to
Washington D.C. on 1-2 October 2001, External Affairs and Raksha Mantri met
President Bush, besides his counterparts and senior members in the Bush
Administration. Home Minister Shri L. K. Advani visited Washington D.C. from 8-12
January 2002 at the invitation of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and also met
President Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney. Raksha Mantri Shri George
Fernandes visited Washington from 16-20 January 2002 at the invitation of the
Defence Secretary Rumsfeld. National Security Adviser and Principal Secretary visited
Washington D.C. at the invitation of the U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza
65

The Americas

Rice from 27-29 June and on 24 & 25 September 2001. On the economic side, Finance
Minister Shri Yashwant Sinha, Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister of
Environment and Forests, Shri Murosali Maran, and Shri T. R. Balu have also met
their counterparts in the U. S. Administration.
From the United States, Cabinet-level visitors included Secretary of State Gen.
Colin Powell on 16 & 17 October 2001 and 17 & 18 January 2002; Deputy Secretary of
State Mr. Richard Armitage, as a Special Emissary of President Bush on 11 May 2001
to discuss the New Strategic Framework of President Bush; U.S. Trade Representative
Zoellick from 7-10 August 2001, the Defence Secretary Mr. Donald Rumsfeld on 5
November 2001 and Governor Christie Whitman, Administrator of the U.S.
Environment Protection Agency from 15-19 January 2002.
Political engagement was accompanied by a broad-based official level dialogue,
especially in pursuit of the Dialogue Architecture. Foreign Office Consultations and
Asian Security Dialogue between Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs was held on 17 May 2001. Two meetings of the Joint Working
Group on Counter-terrorism were held - one on 25 & 26 June 2001 in Washington
D.C. and the second on 21 & 22 January 2002 in New Delhi. The Joint Working Group
on UN Peacekeeping Operations met in Washington D.C. on 28 & 29 June 2001. The
Defence Policy Group, led on the Indian side by the Defence Secretary and on the
U.S. side by the Under Secretary of Defence for Policy, met on 3 & 4 December 2001,
signalling the resumption of normal defence relations between India and the United
States, which had been disrupted after India's nuclear tests in May 1998.
International terrorism was an important subject of India-U.S. engagement in
this period. India's prompt condemnation of the terrorist attacks in the United States
on 11 September and offer of support in bringing its perpetrators to justice was
appreciated by the United States and contributed towards generating the momentum
for building an international coalition against terrorism.
Specific assistance and cooperation was extended on the basis of requests made
by the United States, and included intelligence sharing, assistance in the
investigations into the terrorist attacks of 11 September and logistical support for
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in the form of overflight clearance,
refuelling facilities, berthing facilities, medical assistance and search and rescue
operations. These facilities were also extended to other coalition partners
66

participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. The approvals were based on the
existing guidelines for military assistance to friendly countries.
The two sides maintained regular diplomatic contacts on U.S. response to the
terrorist attacks, India's own concerns regarding Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in
India, the need to have a comprehensive approach to the global war against terrorism
and the political and economic future of post-Taliban Afghanistan. The United States
acknowledged that the war against terrorism covers terrorism affecting India,
including in Jammu & Kashmir.
India-U.S. cooperation also extended to the efforts to achieve a political
settlement in Afghanistan. Constructive dialogue and exchange of views were carried
out on a regular basis at political and official levels in New Delhi, Washington and at
the UN in New York. In recognition of India's experience and capacity to contribute
to economic reconstruction in Afghanistan, India was among a select group of
countries invited to a conference jointly sponsored by the United States and Japan
in Washington D.C. on 20 November 2001 for a discussion on the economic
reconstruction of Afghanistan. India-U.S. consultations also helped in shaping the
settlement between Afghan groups at their meeting in Bonn from 27 November to 5
December 2001, which led to the establishment of the Interim Administration in
Afghanistan.
The United States also took a stronger position than in the past on terrorism
affecting India. The United States condemned the attack on the Assembly building
in Srinagar on 1 October 2001 as a terrorist act, with the White House publicly
stating that President Bush believes that "terrorism must end everywhere, and that
includes in Kashmir". There was, however, no public linkage drawn with Pakistan
with regard to this attack.
The United States strongly condemned the terrorist attack on the Parliament
on 13 December 2001, describing it as outrageous. The U.S. Administration, which
had already placed Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, among others, on the
U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Global Terrorists list and the Terrorist
Exclusion List, added these two organisations to the list of Foreign Terrorist
Organisations maintained by the State Department. In addition, President Bush and
Secretary of State Powell called upon President Musharraf to crack down on terror

Annual Report 2001-2002
networks in Pakistan and take decisive action against Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-eMohammed and other terrorist organisations, their leaders, finances, and activities.
These efforts were also accompanied by concerns regarding mounting tensions
between India and Pakistan, due to the involvement of Pakistan-based organisations
in the attacks. The high level of diplomatic engagement with the United States
following this incident was part of the process of reaching out to the international
community to articulate India's position and expectation from Pakistan. Although
the United States welcomed the statement made by President Musharraf on television
on 12 January 2002, and expressed hope for de-escalation of tensions between India
and Pakistan, it acknowledged that concrete action by Pakistan with regard to
terrorism is necessary for the de-escalation process.
India and the United States also took steps to strengthen bilateral counterterrorism cooperation with a view to prevent acts of terrorism and to eradicate
terrorist organisations. At the fourth meeting of the bilateral Joint Working Group
on Counter-terrorism held on 21 & 22 January 2002 in New Delhi, the two sides
broadened their discussion of the international terrorism situation, agreed to intensify
their intelligence and investigative cooperation and considerably expanded their
cooperation in strengthening preventive, protective and consequence management
capabilities. Besides, the two countries have also agreed within the framework of
defence cooperation to add a new emphasis on counter-terrorism initiatives, including
expanding mutual support in this area.
Despite their focus on the immediate concerns relating to terrorist attacks, the
campaign against terrorism and Afghanistan, India and the United States continued
to pursue their vision of a broad-based and mutually beneficial long-term partnership.
In recognition of their shared strategic interests in Asia and beyond and the positive
contribution that their defence and security cooperation can make to promoting
freedom, global peace, economic progress and security, the two sides took a number
of steps to resume and qualitatively expand defence relations.
The meeting between Minister of External Affairs & Raksha Mantri and U.S.
Defence Secretary Rumsfeld in Washington D.C. on 06 April 2001 laid the foundation
for resumption of defence relations. General Henry Shelton's visit to India from 1820 July 2001 was the first visit to India by a Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command Admiral Blair visited India from 27-29
November 2001 to continue the dialogue between the U.S. Pacific Command and the
Indian Armed Forces. Secretary Rumsfeld's talks with Raksha Mantri in New Delhi
on 5 November 2001 provided the two sides an opportunity to strengthen mutual
understanding on a wide range of short-term and long-term international security
issues and discuss areas of mutually beneficial cooperation. Raksha Mantri's meeting
with Secretary Rumsfeld during his visit to the United States from 16-20 January
2002 added momentum to defence relations between two sides, both for militarymilitary exchanges and defence supplies.
The India-U.S. Defence Policy Group, which met on 3 & 4 December 2001 decided
to resume the Army, Air Force and Navy Executive Steering Groups and set up a
Military Coordination Group to promote military-military exchanges and joint
activities. These groups will meet in February-March to draw up their programme
of activities. In addition, the two sides have revitalised the Joint Technical Group to
stimulate technical cooperation in defence production and have established a Security
Cooperation Group to manage the defence supplies relationship between India and
the United States. In addition, the two sides agreed on a dialogue between the newly
established Integrated Defence Staff of India and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the
United States and dialogue with different geographical operational command
structures of the United States Armed Forces. During Raksha Mantri's visit to the
United States, the two sides also signed the General Security of Military Information
Agreement toprovide mutual protection to military information exchanged between
the two sides.
In the context of their expanding dialogue on international security issues, India
and the United States have begun regular consultations on the New Strategic
Framework (including missile defence) of the United States, unveiled by President
Bush on 1 May 2001, beginning with the visit of Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage's visit on 11 May 2001 as a Special Emissary of President Bush. Prime
Minister and President Bush agreed at their meeting on 9 November 2001 to
institutionalise this consultation through a "New Strategic Framework Dialogue".
The development of stronger defence relations, as also technological and
economic relations, with the United States has been facilitated by the lifting of a
range of unilateral restrictions imposed by the United States under its domestic law
67

The Americas

in response to the nuclear tests of May 1998. The previous U.S. Administration had
lifted some of the economic restrictions in a limited manner. On 22 September 2002,
President Bush lifted all economic, military and technological restrictions. In addition,
on 1 October 2002, the U.S. Department of Commerce reduced the number of Indian
organisations on the Entity List from over 150 to 16 and also eased the restrictions
on the organisations that remained on the Entity List. Export of "dual use" goods
and technology from the United States to India will now be subject, as before May
1998, to U.S. export control laws.
As part of the process of expanding cooperation with the United States, a
beginning has been made in areas of nuclear energy and space. During Prime
Minister's visit to Washington in November 2001, the two sides agreed to resume
the three NRC safety-related projects involving technical information exchanges on
emergency procedures and expand cooperation in scientific and civilian fields such
as weather, migration, and communications.
Government also continued its efforts to strengthen economic and trade ties
with the United States. Besides resuming the three ministerial level dialogues Financial and Economic Forum, India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue and Working Group
on Trade Policy - the two side have added two additional high level dialogues on
Energy and Environment. During her visit to New Delhi in January 2002 Governor
Ms. Christie Whitman, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Minister
of Environment and Forests on promoting cooperation in environmental projects.

Canada
The period 2001-02 saw a turn-around in India-Canada relations. On 20 March
2001 Canadian Foreign Minister, Mr. John Manley made an announcement saying
that Canada had decided to restore relations with India, disrupted since the nuclear
weapons tests in May 1998 and that, it would pursue the broadest possible political
and economic relationship with India. Earlier the same day, he had told a gathering
of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers in London that Canada saw India, along with
China, as the big emerging players. With the announcement, Canada resumed full
CIDA operations in India and also lifted the measures imposed since May 1998,
barring those relating to its voting pattern in international financial institutions on
non-BHN (Basic Human Needs) projects relating to India, and cooperation in the
68

defence field. India decided to fully reciprocate the gesture for normalisation of
relations coming from Canada.
Following the formal announcement, Canadas Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
Mr. Gaetan Lavertu visited New Delhi on 30 April - 1 May 2001, bringing with him
proposals for reviving and enhancing the level of cooperation. Some of the steps
proposed were: exchange of high level visits, meetings between the top leadership
of the two countries on the margins of multilateral fora such as CHOGM and UNGA
and strengthening ongoing cooperation in the areas such as counter-terrorism,
security dialogue and peacekeeping. It was also decided to resume bilateral Foreign
Office Consultations, which had been kept in abeyance since Pokhran-II.
In that regard, a delegation led by Secretary(West) visited Ottawa on 12 June
2001 to hold Foreign Office Consultations. Discussions covered an overview of bilateral
relations, with emphasis on going beyond exchange of views to active cooperation.
The two sides also shared their views on regional issues, relations with great powers
as well as cooperation in the multilateral fora such as the UN, G-8, WTO, etc where
there were avenues for mutually beneficial cooperation. It was also decided to have
such consultations on a regular basis.
Minister of Power Shri Suresh Prabhu visited Canada from 6-10 June. The HighLevel Committee on the Indian diaspora also visited Toronto and Vancouver from
4-9 June .
The 4th meeting of the Indo-Canada Joint Working Group (JWG) on Counterterrorism met in Ottawa on 27 & 28 August 2001. This is the only bilateral mechanism
that has continued uninterrupted even during post-Pokhran hiatus in relations.
During the meeting, there was a conscious effort to move the focus to new and
emerging issues of counter-terrorism as also to make the deliberations more actionoriented. The agenda was accordingly expanded to include cyber crime and cyber
terrorism, CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) terrorism and the
possibility of training in different aspects of counter-terrorism. In past JWG meetings,
the Kanishka bombing investigations had formed a major part of the discussions.
The Canadian side stated that the investigations had reached a concluding stage,
with charges having been laid against the three main accused. The Canadian
government expected to receive convictions in court.

Annual Report 2001-2002
In the wake of 11 September terrorist attacks in the United States, Canada decided
to remove all sanctions on Pakistan as a reward for the latters support for the
campaign against terrorism. Canada similarly removed the remaining sanctions
on India relating to its voting pattern in the international financial institutions.
Sanctions on defence sales are however, still in place. Canada has also introduced
new measures to combat terrorism aimed at suppressing the financing of terrorism
in Canada and freezing the assets of listed people / organisations (which include
Harkat ul-Mujahidin and Jaish-e-Muhammad). Canada condemned both the 1 October
terrorist attack on the Srinagar Assembly as also the 13 December attack on the
Indian Parliament.
Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Mr. Herb Dhaliwal, visited New
Delhi on 7 January 2002 and attended the CII Partnership Summit in Bangalore.
Deputy Prime Minister Mr. John Manley visited New Delhi on 21 & 22 January 2002.
His visit signaled the importance Canada now places on deepening and broadening
its relationship with India, a process Mr. Manley himself had set in motion as Foreign
Minister.

LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Indias relations with the Latin American and Caribbean countries
have been historically trouble-free and friendly. In Indias policy
towards the region the Ministry has emphasized strengthening and reinforcing the
bonds of political cooperation and on enhancing the economic content of Indias
relationship mainly through the Focus LAC programme. As a result of this effort,
Indias political and economic interactions both at the bilateral and multilateral
levels, have proved mutually beneficial. There are presently 13 resident Indian
diplomatic missions and one post in the region. Through concurrent accreditation
and honorary consulates all the other 20 countries in the region are also covered.
Twelve countries from the region have their resident missions in New Delhi.
The mechanism of Foreign Office level bilateral consultations has contributed
greatly to better political understanding within the ambit of Indias bilateral relations.
We have signed MoUs on the subject with 12 countries from the region and a few
more are under active consideration. The regular review of bilateral relations through
this mechanism has helped us focus better on the potentials and concerns of Indias

dialogue partners and has led to better coordination on multilateral issues of common
interest.
The Focus LAC programme launched by the Government of India in November
1997 aimed at sensitizing organizations such as Export Promotion Council, Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, CII, EXIM Bank, etc. to focus on trade promotion activity
in the Latin American and Caribbean countries has started to pay dividends. Areas
of bilateral trade and investment have been identified, economic interaction has
increased and a number of international exhibitions and visits by trade delegations
have helped disseminate valuable information on Indian commodities and
technological advancement, especially in the areas of Information Technology and
pharmaceuticals. Joint Commissions have been set-up with five countries, trade and
economic agreements have been signed with seven countries. A number of accords
have also been signed between the apex trade and industrial bodies of India and
Latin American and Caribbean countries. The overall trade with India has increased
from US $ 1.5 billion last year to US $ 1.7 billion this year. This is specially significant
at a time of global economic downturn.
India is well-known culturally in the LAC region. Indian philosophy, Yoga,
Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings, Indian classical music and dance, Indian cinema
have been a source of inspiration for many in the region. There are more than 500
institutions, schools, libraries, streets and squares named after India and Indian
leaders in the region. Mahatma Gandhis busts and statues have been installed at
important places in a number of countries. At present there are cultural agreements
and cultural exchange programmes with 14 countries. Indian artists and academics
have been visiting Latin American and Caribbean countries regularly under ICCR
sponsorship. ICCR administered scholarships have brought students to Indian
academic institutions. Indian Cultural Centres have been flourishing in countries
with substantial population of persons of Indian origin, such as, Suriname, Trinidad
& Tobago and Guyana. The technical assistance rendered by India under the ITEC
programme for officials, experts and technical personnel for training and study tours
in India as well as sending Indian experts to Latin America and the Caribbean has
helped publicise Indias prowess in training technology and implementing low-cost
schemes.
While politically, the LAC region continued to progress towards democratization,
69

The Americas

economically the region saw one of the worst recessions in history. Presidential
elections heralded a new era in Peru with the advent of the first ethnic Indian
President, Alejandro Toledo to head the Government since the time of the Incas 400
years ago. In Trinidad & Tobago Prime Minister Basdeo Pandays Government fell on
charges of nepotism and corruption with fresh elections now due on 10 December
2001. In Nicaraguas recent Presidential elections former President Daniel Ortega
was defeated by his conservative rival, Enrique Bolanos. On the economic front, the
global recession has added to Argentinas woes limiting its options of servicing its
US $ 132 billion debt. Mexicos NAFTA dream is rapidly turning into a nightmare
with numerous lay-offs and company shut-downs. The region is reeling under the
domino effect of both the US economic slow-down and Argentinas troubles
threatening the very existence of its multilateral economic institution MERCOSUR.
However, the process of economic integration continues and the region is preparing
to be part of the hemispheric free-trade area by December 2005. India has taken
advantage of this phenomenon by proposing PTAs with several key countries in the
region and by establishing a dialogue mechanism with the Rio-Group at the
Ministerial level.

Argentina
Minister for Power, Shri Suresh P. Prabhu, visited Argentina from 20-24 October
2001 to attend the 18th World Energy Congress held in Buenos Aires. He also

countries during the course of the Congress.
India and Argentina, both signatories of the Antarctic Treaty, had signed an
MoU on Cooperation in Antarctic Research in New Delhi in January 1998. Argentina
maintains six technical stations in Antarctica and has some territorial claims over
the icy continent. India has consistently supported the Argentine proposal to establish
the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty in Buenos Aires. In August 2001, the Argentine
Foreign Minister had sent a letter of thanks to Indian EAM in this regard. The Indian
Navy regularly sends participants to the annual Antarctic Navigation Course
conducted in Buenos Aires by the Argentine Navy.

he calendar of meetings of the various bodies of the UN system was
progressing smoothly during the major part of 2001. However, the terrorist
attacks in the US on 11 September had a dramatic impact on the activities of
the United Nations. For the first time in several years, the regular session of the
General Assembly had to be deferred to November, from its traditional calendar of
mid-September. Apart from the condemnation of the attacks by the General Assembly
and the Security Council, the terrorist attacks led to the adoption, without a vote, of
resolution 1373 under Chapter VII of the Charter which meant its being mandatory
on all members of the UN. The negotiations of the draft Comprehensive Convention
for International Terrorism presented by India gained added momentum during the
sessions of the Working Group in October and in the Sixth Committee subsequently.
The Organisation was closely involved in the political restructuring and initiation of
the steps for economic reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The UN continued to engage itself in issues relating to peace keeping in various
conflict-torn regions of the world, human rights, health and population, environment
and climate change, developmental issues and financing for development. India
played a major role in discussions on all these issues and promoted evolution of
consensus, while promoting interests of developing countries in the different
negotiations.

The 56th Session of the General Assembly
The focus of the session was the subject of terrorism, and the agenda item
78

Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism was considered directly in the
plenary. A record number of 167 delegations made statements on this item. Indias
initiative in proposing the Draft Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism was widely welcomed and the need for its early finalisation and adoption
was emphasised. In the General Debate also, which had to be postponed due to the
terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and was held in November, the main focus
was on the topic of terrorism. On the opening day of the session, which was also
delayed by a day, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the terrorist
attacks.
Prime Minister led the delegation to the 56th General Assembly, and spoke in
the General Debate on 10 November. He also had bilateral meetings with the
Presidents of Argentina, Iran and Cyprus, and with the Prime Minister of Mauritius.
In his statement Shri Vajpayee expressed Indias support for the current
campaign against international terrorism. The tragedy of 11 September had created
the opportunity to fashion a determined global response to terrorism, wherever it
exists and under whatever name. India had its own bitter experience of global
networks developed by terrorists and driven by religious extremism. He also called
for strict curbs on sources of financing for terrorists and denying them safe havens
for training, arming and operations. Prime Minister Vajpayee also called for greater
resolve for addressing issues of equitable development and war against poverty. He
reiterated Indias offer for a coordinated and comprehensive global dialogue on
development.

Annual Report 2001-2002
EAM accompanied the Prime Minister to the General Assembly. He stayed on to
represent India at the Ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement and held

Group. He held bilateral discussions with the Foreign Ministers of several key Member
States. EAM also met the Secretary General and Lakhdar Brahimi, the SGs Special
Representative for Afghanistan.

the Commission on Human Settlements into a United Nations programme called
UN-Habitat to increase its stature and enhance its operational capacity.
The 26th Special Session of the General Assembly to Review the problem of
HIV/AIDS in all its aspects was held in New York from 25-27 June 2001. The Indian
delegation was led by Minister of Health & Family Welfare, Dr. C.P. Thakur, and
included Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Smt. Sonia Gandhi, Member,
Planning Commission,Shri Kamaluddin Ahmed, senior officials and representatives
of civil society. The Special Session adopted a Declaration of Commitment on HIV/
AIDS.
India participated actively in the negotiations during the preparatory process.
It emphasised that poverty should be recognised as a contributory factor for the
spread of HIV/AIDS, that the needs of developing countries other than those in Africa
should be taken into account, the prevention must be the mainstay of the response,
that medicines and drugs should be available at prices commensurate with local
purchasing power and that developing countries would be unable to accept
obligations for the provision of anti-retroviral therapy in the absence of adequate
and assured international resources. These are reflected in the outcome document.
India also strongly supported the proposal for the establishment of a Global AIDS
and Health Fund.
Following the escalation of tensions in Palestine throughout the autumn, and
after the US vetoed a draft resolution in the Security Council on 15 December, the
Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group called for the resumption of the Tenth
Emergency Special Session. This was convened on the afternoon of 20 December ,

and adopted the text of the draft vetoed in the Council. The General Assembly also
adopted a resolution on the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the
Occupied Palestinian Territory. Since South Africa made a statement on behalf of the
Non-Aligned Movement, India did not speak separately in the debate. India voted
for both the resolutions, which were adopted by the usual overwhelming majorities.

The Security Council
India participated, and its contribution was noted, in open meetings of the
Security Council on issues including peace-building; strengthening cooperation with
troop-contributing countries; protection of civilians in armed conflict; the situation
between Iraq and Kuwait; and the situation in Afghanistan.
The Open Ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation
and Increase in the Membership of the UN Security Council (OEWG) which has been
examining different aspects of the reform and restructuring of the UN Security Council
since 1993, met five times during the year. There was no agreement on any of the
substantive issues, either in the OEWG or in the annual debate in the UN General
Assembly on the report of this Working Group.
India continued to participate actively in the Open Ended Working Group on
the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the
Security Council.
There were enhanced expressions of support for Indias candidature for
permanent membership of the UNSC during the year. In the UN, Russia, France,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Mauritius, Ireland and Armenia openly supported Indias
candidature for permanent membership of the UNSC. During bilateral visits, a number
of other countries expressed support for Indias candidature during discussions.

Environment & Sustainable Development Issues
The ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development was held in
New York from 16-27 April 2001 and addressed issues relating to Energy, Atmosphere,
Transport and International cooperation for an enabling environment.
The Indian delegation, led by Minister of Environment & Forests, Shri T. R. Baalu,
stated that the contrast between the lack of access to energy in developing countries
and the over-consumption in developed countries was glaring and unsustainable.
79

United Nations and International Organisations

He emphasised that financial resources, technology, managerial capacities and
political will were needed if one third of the worlds population that lacks energy
was to be given access to reliable, regular and affordable energy. Similarly, Shri Baalu
stated that huge financial resources, including international financial assistance, on
concessional terms was required for road development in developing countries.
The Indian delegation participated at the tenth session of the Commission on
Sustainable Development which was converted into an Open-ended Preparatory
Committee for the World Summit on Sustainable Development and held its
organizational session in New York from 30 April  2 May 2001. India expressed the
view that the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in
Johannesburg in 2002, should focus on the implementation of Agenda 21 with a
view to identifying shortcomings and evolving concrete measures to remedy them.
The VII Session of the Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (COP VII) was held in Marrakech, Morocco, from 29 October - 9
November 2001. India was nominated by the Asian Group to the Bureau of COP VII,
and continued to act as the Spokesman of G-77 and China on the three Mechanisms
of the Kyoto Protocol. The Marrakech meeting agreed on the modalities and
procedures for the implementation of the three Mechanisms, viz., Joint
Implementation, The Clean Development Mechanism, and Emission Trading of the
Kyoto Protocol, pursuant to the political consensus hammered out at the Resumed
Session of COP VI in Bonn in July 2001. The agreement on implementation of the
Mechanisms is expected to pave the way for the ratification of the Protocol by
developed countries (except for the US, which withdrew from the Protocol in February
2001) and accelerate the process of its entry into force by September 2002, in time
for the World Summit on Sustainable Development scheduled to take place in
Johannesburg. India has also offered to host the VIII Session of COP in New Delhi
towards the end of next year.

The Economic and Social Council
The substantive session of ECOSOC was held in Geneva from 2-27 July. The theme
for the High-Level Segment was The role of the United Nations in support of the
efforts of African countries to achieve sustainable development. As these discussions
were taking place immediately after the OAU Lusaka Summit, where the New African
80

Initiative (NAI) was launched, references were made to it in the Ministerial
Declaration.
The Coordination Segment discussed The role of the UN system in promoting
development, particularly with respect to access to and transfer of technology,
especially ICTs, inter-alia, through partnerships with relevant stakeholders, including
the private sector. It called for support for the ICT Task Force, as a framework
through which the transfer, adaptation and post-transfer follow of knowledge and
ICT can take place.
In addition, ECOSOC also took note of the Global Code of Ethics, adopted by the
World Tourism Organisation as an outline of principles to guide tourism development
and to serve as a reference for stakeholders in the tourism sector.
The fourth annual high-level meeting of ECOSOC with the Bretton Woods
institutions was held in New York on 1 May. Addressing the meeting in his capacity
as the Chairman of the Development Committee, Finance Minister Shri Yashwant
Sinha called for the World Banks continued involvement with the middle-income
countries where 80 per cent of the worlds poor live through supporting stable
sustainable private investment flows and financial assistance for promoting
sustainable growth and poverty reduction. In this context, Finance Minister
enunciated a six-point action programme.

UN Forum on Forests
The UN Forum on Forests, established in 2000 as a subsidiary body of ECOSOC
with universal membership, held its organizational session from 12-16 February
2001 and its first substantive session in New York from 11-22 June 2001 where the
Multiyear Programme of Work, the Plan of Action for Implementation and Initiation
of Work of UNFF with the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF) were finalised.

Disarmament Issues
Indias commitment to non-discriminatory and universal nuclear disarmament
continued to be reflected in its policy pronouncements and diplomatic initiatives.
The countrys stand on issues related to disarmament and international security in
various multilateral and regional forums was premised on Indias national security

Annual Report 2001-2002
interests and the nations tradition of close engagement with the international
community.
The series of bilateral dialogues commenced after May 1998 continued to be
pursued this year. New security dialogues were also initiated with Japan and Australia.
All these have resulted in greater appreciation of Indias security concerns and its
role as a responsible member of the international community. Harmonisation of
Indias national imperatives and security obligations with international concerns
on non-proliferation and disarmament also progressed steadily.
On the regional level, Indias participation in the confidence and security building
process and structure under the ASEAN Regional Forum acquired greater momentum.
India was also actively involved in similar processes underway in the Conference on
Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia.
Regular contact was maintained with key international and non-governmental
organisation active in the field of disarmament with a view to disseminating the
Indian perspectives on disarmament issues. Enquiries from Honble Members of
Parliament on all relevant developments were also responded to and due information
brought to the attention of the Parliament.
United Nations General Assembly
India continued to play an active role on disarmament issues in the First
Committee of the 56th UN General Assembly. India projected her role as a leading
voice for the interests of the developing nations as well as a key player in the dialogues
related to strategic stability in the South Asian region through active involvement
in the debates on all proposals for resolutions taken up at the First Committee.
India is the only nuclear weapon State that believes that its security would be
enhanced in a nuclear-weapons-free-world. With this commitment to global nuclear
disarmament, it continued to press for negotiations on a Nuclear Weapons Convention
that will prohibit forever the development, production, stockpiling, use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons, and provide for the elimination of all existing weapons
under international verification.
India has clearly and categorically stated its policy of no-first-use of nuclear
weapons. However, the doctrines of first use of nuclear weapons have persisted,
and, in fact, are being re-validated and reaffirmed. There is need for the international

community to take decisive steps to de-legitimize nuclear weapons. Indias resolution
on Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons called for a
multilateral agreement prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, which will also
contribute to a positive climate for negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear
weapons. It was adopted with the support of 104 countries.
In 1998, India had introduced its resolution Reducing Nuclear Danger, which
calls for the review of nuclear doctrines and immediate and urgent steps to reduce
the risk of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons. This resolution, for
which co-sponsorship has grown, was adopted this year with 98 countries voting in
favour.
Indias resolution on Role of Science and Technology in the Context of
International Security and Disarmament, highlighting the qualitative aspects of
the arms race, and the need for a genuinely multilateral and non-discriminatory
response, was adopted with the support of 92 countries.
India was actively involved in the deliberations on a number of other important
resolutions in the First Committee. It co-sponsored a Malaysian resolution reaffirming
the validity of the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice that
called on all nuclear weapon states to work towards nuclear disarmament. It also
voted in favour of a Russian resolution on the preservation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
Conference on Disarmament
At the Conference on Disarmament (CD), the sole multilateral disarmament treaty
negotiating body, which considers recommendations from the United Nations General
Assembly while pursuing a permanent Agenda called the Decalogue, India assumed
a higher profile with the accreditation of the Permanent Representative of India to
the Conference on Disarmament. In the Conference, which held three 5-6 week
sessions this year (22 January-30 March, 14 May-29 June, and 30 July-14 September),
India participated in debate, discussion and consensus building processes to focus
on strategic disarmament issues and supported steps for negotiating a nondiscriminatory, multilateral, internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning
the production of fissile materials. Through the sub-group of Non-Aligned Countries
called the Group of 21, India participated in the examination of specific issues relating
81

United Nations and International Organisations

to nuclear disarmament and prevention of an arms race in outer space. India was
also actively involved in the examination of proposed measures to overcome the
present stalemate in the finalisation of a Programme of Work for the CD, on which
consensus has been prevented by conflicting priorities of certain key countries. These
proposals include expansion of membership of the CD, review of its Agenda and
steps towards improved and effective functioning of the CD.
United Nations Disarmament Commission
India participated in the 2001 substantive session of the United Nations
Disarmament Commission held from 9-27 April in New York to consider Ways and
Means to Achieve Nuclear Disarmament and Practical Confidence Building Measures
in the Field of Conventional Arms, and was actively involved in the effort to build
upon the broad consensus manifested in the United Nations Millennium Declaration
towards this objective.
International Atomic Energy Agency
At the instance of the countries comprising the Group of 77, a new feature
introduced in the March 2001 meeting of the Board of Governors of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was a debate on the Nuclear Technology Review 2001.
India led a group of countries who maintained that nuclear energy will continue to
be an important part of the energy mix of the future, and that it should be included
in the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. From the point of view
of economy as well as the environment, India emphasised that nuclear energy will
continue to be important for developing countries. The conclusion drawn by the
Chairman of the Board of Governors from the debate was that countries should be
left to take their own decisions regarding utilisation of the most suitable forms of
energy for their purposes.
The 45th General Conference (GC) of the IAEA met in Vienna from 17-21
September 2001 in the shadow of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington
DC. The Conference issued a presidential statement, which focused on the need for
protecting nuclear installations, nuclear materials and other radioactive substances
from terrorist attacks. The Director General of the IAEA was asked to review the
activities and programmes of the Agency with a view to strengthening its work
relevant to preventing acts of terrorism involving nuclear materials and other
radioactive substances.
82

During the traditional debate on the relative importance of the different pillars
of the IAEAs activities, India worked with other like-minded countries to ensure
that the balance between these different activities was maintained. The budgetary
allocation on Technical Cooperation was preserved at the same level through efforts
of the G-77 despite strong reservations against nuclear power expressed by several
countries. India also endeavoured to maintain a balanced approach in the GC
resolution on safeguards for all the Member States of the Agency without
discrimination, and clearly placed on record that Indias membership of the IAEA
did not impose any obligation on her other than those in the Statute of the Agency.
India also chaired the Scientific Forum, which was held to coincide with the
IAEAs General Conference. This year, the focus of the Forum was on Servicing Human
Needs Using Nuclear Energy.
Chemical Weapons Convention
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),
headquartered in The Hague entered its fifth year of existence on 29 April 2001.
India is an original State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and
continues to fully discharge the obligations assumed by it. In the past four years,
the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW has conducted more than 1000 routine
inspections at chemical weapon storage sites, former chemical weapons production
facilities and other chemical industry plants in many States Parties to the Convention.
India has received over 60 inspections at different facilities and these have been
conducted in a smooth manner. As a member of the Executive Council since its
inception, India has been actively involved in its deliberations and decision-making
processes to ensure the implementation of all provisions of the Convention in a
non-discriminatory and balanced manner.
Having declared possession of chemical weapons to the OPCW in 1997, Indias
destruction efforts, under OPCW inspection, have been proceeding according to the
destruction timelines established in the Convention, with the OPCW having duly
taken note of the destruction plans.
Following the completion of formalities for national implementation measures,
the National Authority, established to implement the obligations assumed by India
under this Convention, has been undertaking necessary implementation-related steps.

Annual Report 2001-2002
Inordinate delays in implementing key provisions of the Convention relating to
international cooperation and assistance, along with a severe strain on the OPCWs
financial situation resulting from persistent under-funding, are matters of continuing
concern for a number of Member States, including India. These issues need to be
addressed on a priority basis.
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention
Although the 22, 23 and 24 Sessions of the Ad-Hoc Group of States Parties to the
Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) - held in Geneva during 2001 to
carry out negotiations and conclude a legally binding instrument for strengthening
the Convention - ended in a stalemate, following the rejection by USA of the draft
Protocol in end-July, India remained active in efforts to strengthen the Convention.
In the 5th Review Conference of the BTWC held from 19 November to 7 December
2001, India played a central role in facilitating progress towards consensus on key
elements with a view to recommending a programme of work for the future. However,
the Review Conference ended inconclusively with an agreement to resume work in
November 2002.
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
The 2nd Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which
May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW)
was held in Geneva from 11-21 December 2001, with the Indian delegation playing
an active role. The Conference agreed to expand the scope of the CCW to include
non-international armed conflicts. Main Committee I of the Conference, which dealt
with this issue, was chaired by Ambassador Rakesh Sood of India. The Conference
also agreed to establish an open-ended Group of Governmental Experts, with two
separate coordinators, to discuss the issue of Explosive Remnants of War and to
further explore the issue of Anti-Vehicle Mines. It was decided that a meeting of
States Parties to the CCW will be held in December 2002 to review the work of this
Group, as also to undertake consultations regarding options to promote compliance
with the Convention and its Protocols. Ambassador Rakesh Sood of India has also
been appointed Chairman-designate of this meeting.

UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons
In the first ever UN Conference on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons
in All Its Aspects, held in New York from 9-20 July 2001, India played an active role
both in the preparatory process of shaping the agenda, as well as during the
Conference, in formulating a Programme of Action to address the security challenges
caused by illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.
Outer Space Affairs
The 44th Session of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space
(UNCOPUOS) took place in Vienna during 6-15 June 2001. The Indian delegation,
which played an active role, was led by Chairman, ISRO and Secretary, Department
of Space, Dr. K. Kasturirangan. UNCOPUOS discussed ways and means of maintaining
Outer Space for peaceful purposes, implementation of the recommendations of the
UNISPACE III, spin-off benefits of space technology as well as the Reports of the 38th
session of the Scientific and Technical Sub-Committee and the 40th session of the
Legal Sub-Committee.
During the UNCOPUOS meeting, an international symposium on The Human
Dimension in Space Science and Technology Applications was organised where
Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Shri G. Madhavan Nair, presented a paper
on Space and Society: Indian Scenario. India was selected as the Coordinator of one
of the Action Groups for implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE III.
India would be the Coordinator of the Action Group on improving management of
earths natural resources.
The 40th session of the Legal Sub-Committee on UN Committee on the Peaceful
Uses of Outer Space took place in Vienna on 2-12 April 2001. The Sub-Committee

83

United Nations and International Organisations

to continue discussions on creation of a Global Control System on missile proliferation
proposed by the Russian Federation. Indian officials also attended a Roundtable
Meeting held in Warsaw on 17 &18 May 2001 to discuss the Draft International Code
of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation proposed by the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR). India is also represented on a UN Expert Panel on Missiles
set up under a UN General Assembly Resolution, which held its first meeting in New
York from 30 July to 3 August 2001. In connection with the French initiative to host
an international conference in Paris in early 2002 to work on a revised Draft
International Code of Conduct, a French Foreign Office delegation also visited New
Delhi in December 2001.
ASEAN Regional Forum
India took part in the work of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) through
participation in the various meetings organised under the aegis of the ARF during
the year. The ARF Inter-sessional Support Group Meeting on Confidence Building
Measures (ISG on CBMs) was held in Kuala Lumpur from 18-20 April 2001. The ISG on
CBMs was preceded by an Expert Group Meeting on Transnational Crime. This
meeting discussed further the issues of anti-piracy, illicit trafficking in small arms,
and illegal migration. The ARF Senior Officials Meeting held in Hanoi in May 2001
took stock of the developments and prepared for the ARF Ministerial Meeting in July.
The 8th ARF was held in Hanoi on 25 July 2001. Deputy Chairman of the Planning
Commission, Shri K.C. Pant led the Indian delegation. The meeting reviewed the
progress of the Forum and discussed its future direction. Detailed presentations were
made by ARF member states on various issues concerning regional and international
security. The Indian delegation highlighted the threat to security posed by
international terrorism and the need for ARF members to cooperate in combating it.
The meeting endorsed Indias offer to Co-Chair, along with Vietnam, the ARF
ISG on CBMs for the year 2001-2002. India successfully hosted the first meeting of
the ISG on CBMs in New Delhi from 19-21 December 2001. Representatives from 22
ARF participating countries attended the meeting. Delegates also made a field visit
to Agra and witnessed live demonstrations by the armed forces.
Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia
Indian delegations participated actively in meetings of the Conference on
84

Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) held in Almaty,
Kazakhstan to negotiate a Document to be signed by the Heads of State or
Government of all CICA Member States. The Document was finalised in September
2001 but the CICA Summit scheduled for November 2001 was postponed on account
of the situation in Afghanistan. The Summit is now expected to be held in mid-2002.

Political Issues
Terrorism
In many ways the horrific terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September served
to push terrorism to centre stage of the international agenda, particularly in the
latter half of the year.
The annual debate that traditionally takes place on Measures to Eliminate
Terrorism in the Sixth (Legal) Committee, was shifted to the UN General Assembly
and held from 1-5 October 2001. An unprecedented number of countries  over 167
 spoke condemning terrorism and urging strengthened international cooperation
to combat terrorism. At the same time, the preoccupation for some countries with
the deteriorating situation in the Middle East and the escalating violence that
characterised the latter half of the year meant that several countries also laid
emphasis on the need for a definition of terrorism that would differentiate struggles
against foreign occupation from terrorism. Some countries called for an international
conference to deal with these issues. In our statement we pointed out that terrorism
cannot be justified on any grounds and called for comprehensive, sustained
international cooperation to combat terrorism, which should be directed not only
at the perpetrators of terrorism, but also those who sponsor, support and finance
such acts.
The third round of discussion on Indias initiative for a Comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism was held from 15-26 October. There was
considerable progress, with agreement being reached on many articles, except some
issues. It was agreed that further consultations would take place from end January
2002.
On September 12, UN Security Council adopted resolution 1368 condemning
the terrorist attacks in USA. Subsequently on 28 September 2001, it adopted resolution
1373 (2001) which outlined wide ranging and comprehensive steps and strategies

Annual Report 2001-2002
to combat international terrorism. The resolution, inter alia, called on all States to
prevent and suppress financing of terrorist activities, freeze all financial assets and
economic resources of possible terrorists; refrain from providing any form of support
including recruitment and training etc. to terrorists. The need to strengthen
international cooperation to combat terrorism, including implementation of existing
conventions etc.
The resolution, which was adopted under Chapter VII of the UNSC, is mandatory
and binding on all States. To monitor implementation of the Convention, a Committee
comprising all members of the Council was set up. All States are expected to report
to the Committee within 90 days, on the steps they have taken to implement the
resolution.
As a victim of cross border terrorism for several decades and having played a
leading role over the years in drawing the international communitys attention to
combat terrorism, India welcomed UNSC resolution 1373. India sees the resolution
as being in harmony with its own approach for a Comprehensive Convention on
International Terrorism. India is fully committed to implementing its obligations
under the resolution and is submitting its National Report on the measures taken to
eliminate terrorism which also cover the measures contained in resolution 1373, to
the UN Security Council.
The issue of terrorism and the need for enhanced international cooperation to
combat terrorism was also discussed in meetings of Joint Working Groups that India
has with several countries on this issue, notably Indo-French Joint Working Group
on Terrorism (7 September 2001), Indo-UK Joint Working Group on International
Terrorism and Drug Trafficking (22 January 2001 and 19 December 2001), Indo-US
Joint Working Group on Counter Terrorism (7-8 February 2001), Indo-EU Joint Working
Group on International Terrorism (9 November 2001), and Indo-Canadian Joint
Working Group (22-28 August 2001). The enhanced awareness in the international
community and sensitivity to the concerns India has been raising on terrorism found
a reflection in number of declarations/communiques adopted at the bilateral levels,
including Indo-Russian Joint Declaration on Terrorism, Indo-EU Declaration on
Terrorism etc.
Afghanistan
The Committee of Experts set up under the resolution 1333 to make

recommendations on a monitoring mechanism to ensure implementation of the arms
embargo and closure of terrorist training camps by the Taliban, visited India from
12-14 April 2001. They also visited USA, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
Pakistan, Iran and Belgium. In India, the Committee had meetings with a range of
officials. The need for an effective monitoring mechanism to ensure full compliance
and implementation of UNSCR 1333 was stressed. On 30 July 2001, the UNSC adopted
resolution 1368 which put in place a two tier mechanism to monitor implementation
of the sanctions embodied in UNSCR 1333. The mechanism comprises a five member
New York based monitoring group and a 15-member sanction enforcement support
team. India is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations under these resolutions.
On 14 November, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1378 which while
condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for export of
terrorism, expressed strong support for the efforts of the Afghan people to establish
a new and transitional administration leading to the formation of a government,
both of which should be broad based, multi-ethnic and fully representative of all the
Afghan people, committed to peace with Afghanistans neighbours, which should
respect human rights of all Afghan people, respect Afghanistans international
obligations, including full cooperation in international efforts to combat terrorism
and illicit trafficking etc. The resolution called on all Afghan forces to refrain from
acts of reprisal and affirms the central role of the UN in supporting the Afghan
people to establish a new transitional administration.
Subsequently, after UN sponsored talks in Bonn came to a successful conclusion
on 5 December 2001, the Security Council on 6 December adopted UNSCR 1383
welcoming and endorsing the agreement on transitional arrangements in
Afghanistan, pending re-establishment of permanent government institutions. The
resolution supports an enhanced UN role and involvement, particularly in the context
of Special Representative of UNSG in advising the interim authority investigation of
human rights abuses etc.
Decolonisation
As a founding member of the Special Committee on the situation with regard to
the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples (C-24), India continued to play a useful and constructive role
within it. As in the past, India participated in the Regional Seminar on Decolonisation
85

United Nations and International Organisations

held at Havana, Cuba in May. The relationship between the administering powers
and the committee, which in the past had been characterised by confrontation, has
improved considerably in recent years. The committee has engaged the administering
powers in discussions to develop concrete programmes of work for each non-selfgoverning territory.
Africa
The Open Ended Ad-Hoc Working Group of the General Assembly, established
by the 54th session, continued to examine and monitor the implementation of the
Secretary Generals recommendations for Africas development and for peace and
security in the continent. India participated constructively in the work of the Working
Group.

Peacekeeping
India continued to be among the largest troop contributors to UN peacekeeping
operations in 2001, even after the withdrawal of its contingents from Sierra Leone
(UNAMSIL), which began in December 2000, and was completed in February 2001.
India is presently the fourth largest troop contributor.
At Indias insistence, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and
the General Assembly endorsed the view that a further strengthening of the
Secretariat to help it backstop peacekeeping operations should be based on a
comprehensive review of its capabilities, and not on ad hoc estimates without proper
justification. Consequently, the Secretariat undertook an extensive review of its ability
to conduct peacekeeping operations, based on a managerial study done by an
independent consultancy firm. Maj. Gen. Inder Rikhye (Retd.) was an adviser to the
firm and Lt. Gen. Satish Nambiar (Retd) was a member of a panel of eternal experts
that reviewed its report. Based on these inputs, the Secretary General submitted his
report to the General Assembly, and the Special Committee on Peacekeeping
Operations met in a delayed session in June-July to consider it. India played a crucial
role in discussions in the Special Committee and in arriving at a consensus report.
The Secretariat was particularly grateful for this support.
An issue that has dominated discussions on peacekeeping in the UN has been
the need to strengthen cooperation between troop contributors, the Security Council
and the Secretariat, a cause that India has espoused for a number of years. As a fall86

out of the crisis in UNAMSIL (Sierra Leone) last year, the Security Council scheduled
an open debate in January 2001 to hear the views of troop contributing countries.
Indias detailed statement during the debate formed the basis of various proposals
submitted to the Security Council in this regard. The Council set up a Working Group
on UN Peacekeeping Operations to consider these proposals and other generic
peacekeeping issues.
In May 2001, India joined Canada, Argentina, Ghana, Jordan, Netherlands and
New Zealand in submitting a proposal to the Security Council for the setting up of
mission specific cooperative management committees comprising Council Members,
major troop contributors and the Secretariat, for a particular mission. In June, the
Security Council passed Resolution 1353, which sought to strengthen the partnership
between the troop contributors, the Council and the Secretariat promised to consider
proposals for a new mechanism of cooperation. The Working Group of the Security
Council met regularly to consider such proposals and also interacted with proponents
of a new mechanism. There was general appreciation for the forceful and forthright
manner in which India championed the cause of troop contributing countries both
in the Special Committee in Peacekeeping Operations and other relevant forums in
the UN.
A National Seminar on UN Peacekeeping Operations was organised by the Indian
Centre for UN Peacekeeping on 25 & 26 July 2001, to deliberate on the
recommendations made by the Panel on UN Peace Operations headed by Lakdhar
Brahimi. The Centre also conducted two training capsules for Military Observers,
Staff Officers and Junior Officers with participation of foreign nominees.
UNMEE
India contributed over 1300 troops to the newly established UN Peacekeeping
Mission in Ethiopia-Eritrea(UNMEE) between March and June 2001. The peace process
between Ethiopia and Eritrea moved forward with the establishment of 25-Km wide
Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) on 18 April 2001. A composite delegation, led by the
Vice Chief of Army Staff, visited Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1-4 August 2001 to meet
the Indian contingent deployed in UNMEE and to assess the ground situation.
UNIFIL
Major General L.M.Tewari, took over the charge of Force Commander of UN

Annual Report 2001-2002
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on 18 August 2001. India has contributed an
Infantry Battalion with over 800 troops to UNIFIL since November 1998. The Vice
Chief of Army Staff visited Lebanon to assess the local situation following UN decision
to scale down the strength of UNIFIL.
UNMIK
A composite delegation from MHA and MEA visited Kosovo from 28-30 November
2001 to meet the personnel of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Indian Civilian Police
Officers deployed in the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and to have assessment of
the political situation, following the Kosovo-wide Assembly elections, with a view
to Indias continued participation.
Cooperation between the UN and the IPU
In its capacity as the country representing the Presidency of the IPU, India piloted
the annual resolution on Cooperation between the UN and the IPU. India also led
the efforts for a resolution which would give the organisation observer status in the
General Assembly. The absence of consensus on various matters of detail, however,
did not allow for the resolution to be adopted; the proposal will be considered again
next year.

Economic Issues
At the 56th General Assembly, India continued to play an active role in the
Second Committee of the 54th GA, which examined a range of macro-economic,
environmental and development issues.
Poverty remained the main issue that was discussed under the agenda item,
Implementation of the First UN Decade for Eradication on Poverty. The resolution
that was adopted expressed concern that the recent economic slowdown, particularly
its adverse impact on developing countries, could hinder the realization of the goal
of poverty eradication. The resolution called for the strengthening of international
assistance to developing countries in their efforts to alleviate poverty.
As many of the macro-economic issues were being covered in the substantive
agenda of the International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in
Mexico in 2002, it was agreed that in the current GA session there would not be any
substantive resolutions on these issues.

Similarly, discussions on the environment issues took place against the backdrop
of the preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in
Johannesburg, South Africa in September 2002. The resolutions on environment
reiterated that all meetings and processes related to sustainable development,
including the discussions of the proposed international - development governance
should provide their inputs to the Preparatory Committee for the Summit for its
consideration.
India participated in the triennial policy review of operational activities for
development of the UN. The review, which is conducted every three years, is
important as it considers policy issues relating to the operations of the funds,
programmes and specialised agencies with the view to making them more responsive
to the needs of developing countries and by addressing the question of mobilising
increased resources.
The Third UN Conference on LDCs was held in Brussels from 14-20 May 2001.
Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations in New York, Shri Kamalesh
Sharma who led the Indian delegation, stated that the growing marginalisation of
the LDCs in the world economy needed to be addressed frontally by the international
community through support in capacity building, financial assistance and access to
technology. He mentioned that, within the context of South-South co-operation,
India had for more than four decades, constantly tried to increase mutually beneficial
economic cooperation with all LDCs, in particular through its programme of economic
and technical cooperation.
Pursuant to the decision at the Conference that there should be an efficient and
a visible follow-up mechanism for the implementation of the Brussels Plan of Action,
the UN General Assembly at its 56th session decided to establish the Office for the
High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, the Landlocked Developing
Countries and the Small Island Developing States.
India participated actively in the preparatory Committee meetings for the
International Conference on Financing for Development, arguing for a positive and
an action-oriented outcome of the Conference that would make available to
developing countries adequate, predictable and stable finances for development.
The Fifth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit
87

United Nations and International Organisations

Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and
Developmental Institutions was held in New York from 30 July to 3 August 2001.
India stated that co-operation between the landlocked and transit developing
countries was pivotal for an effective response to transit transport issues and pointed
out to the spirit of mutual respect and understanding permeates Indias relationship
with Nepal and Bhutan, its two landlocked developing neighbours.
The meeting recommended the convening of a Ministerial meeting on transit
transport systems in 2003 and welcomed the offer of Kazakhstan to host the meeting.
The UN General Assembly at its 56 session endorsed this decision.

Social, Human Rights and Humanitarian Issues
India participated actively in the meeting of the Commission on the Status of
Women which was held in March 2001. The priority themes were to provide inputs
for the World Conference on Racism and the Special Session on Children.
The Special Session of the World Summit on Children which was to be held in
September along with the General Assembly, was postponed due to the terrorist
attacks in New York.
India was an active participant in the debate on social protection at the
Commission for Social Development, which was the priority theme for the
Commission held in April 2001.
India was active in the Committee on Non-Governmental Organisations and
chaired several sessions of its Working Group.
India was elected Vice Chair from the Asian region for the Preparatory Committee
of the Second World Assembly on Ageing to be held in Madrid in April 2002.
India continued to work towards the achievement of a balance between civil
and political rights on the one hand and economic, social and cultural rights on the
other. India also continued to work against the practice of country spotlighting. It
advocated the promotion of human rights as its best protection.
India also continued, under the umbrella of the Group of 77, to pilot the resolution
on International Cooperation in humanitarian assistance on natural disasters, from
relief to development. This resolution reaffirms the Guiding Principles of humanitarian
assistance; recognizes the importance of the principles of neutrality, humanity and
88

impartiality of humanitarian assistance; stresses that humanitarian assistance in
the field of natural disasters should be provided in accordance with and with due
respect for the Guiding Principles and call on the Secretary General to consider
mechanisms to improve the international response to natural disasters.
India participated actively in the meetings of the UN Commission on Human
Rights, the Sub-Commission on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the
Human Rights debate in the Economic and Social Council as also the UN General
Assembly. Indias participation in these was guided by its stature as the largest
democracy in the world, its developing country status as also its commitment to
the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human rights and its desire to
promote a culture of tolerance and pluralism. It also called for depoliticization of
human rights debates and promotion of cooperation, dialogue and national capacity
building as the most effective means of promoting human rights. India also monitored
closely developments relating to standard setting in the field of human rights.
India participated actively in the 57th Session of the Commission on Human
Rights held from 19 March to 27 April 2001. The Indian delegation contributed in a
meaningful manner to the deliberations in the CHR by engaging pro-actively on
substantive issues as also by building consensus cutting across entrenched positions.
India refrained from aligning itself with any coalitions, and its engagement with
delegations across the board was issue based. India made statements under all major
agenda items and these were well received and appreciated. India cosponsored 23
resolutions during the CHR meeting and participated in negotiations on all major
resolutions. India also worked closely with the sponsors of the resolutions on Human
Rights and Terrorism and on Human Rights in Afghanistan. The language of the
former resolution against terrorism was strengthened. In the case of the resolution
on Afghanistan, Indias efforts resulted in greater coverage of the human rights
violations perpetrated by the Taliban regime.
India made a significant contribution both to the preparatory process of the
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance as also to the Conference which was held in Durban (South Africa) from
31 August to 8 September 2001. The Indian delegation was an active participant in
the meetings of two working groups and the second and third sessions of the
Preparatory Committee which took place in 2001. India was also amongst a group

Annual Report 2001-2002
of 21 countries that was assigned the task of simplifying the complex draft document
for the Conference. The work of this group made an important contribution to the
preparatory process. The Indian delegation to the Conference was led by MOS(EA)
and included five members of Parliament and senior officials. The delegation
highlighted Indias unflinching commitment to the struggle against racism and its
contribution to the process of decolonisation and dismantling of Apartheid. Both
during the preparatory process and the Conference, Indias efforts were aimed at
building consensus across the divides that emerged from time to time in a number
of areas, particularly in regard to the Palestinian issue and issues relating to slavery,
colonialism and compensation, etc. India also made a key contribution in ensuring
that the focus of the Conference was not diffused through introduction of extraneous
issues by vested interests.
A number of eminent Indians continued to serve with distinction as members
of important Human Rights mechanisms and Treaty Bodies. These included, Shri
Soli J. Sorabjee (Expert member of the Sub-Commission on Promotion and Protection
of Human Rights), Shri Kapil Sibal (Chairman  Rapporteur of the CHR Working Group
on Arbitrary Detention), Shri P N Bhagwati (Chair of the Human Rights Committee
and Regional Adviser to High Commissioner for Human Rights for the Asia-Pacific
region), Shri Abid Hussain (Special Rapporteur on the Right of Freedom of Opinion
and Expression), Shri Arjun Sengupta (Independent expert on the Right to
Development), Shri R V Pillai (Member of the Committee on Elimination of Racial
Discrimination) and Shri Miloon Kothari (Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate
Housing).
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) Mrs. Mary Robinson paid
an official visit to India from 15-19 November to receive the Indira Gandhi Prize for
Peace, Disarmament and Development for the year 2000, at the hands of President
Narayanan. During the visit, HCHR met Indian leaders and also inaugurated the
Workshop for Judges on the Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in
South Asia, organised by the Office of the HCHR and hosted by India on 17 & 18
November. Mrs. Robinsons visit took place against the backdrop of the 11 September
terrorist attacks on the US and concerns expressed in various quarters regarding the
need to protect human rights fully while enacting and implementing new legislation
for dealing with international terrorism. Indias concerns on the subject  particularly

as pertaining to India  as well as Indias commitment to fight terrorism while
protecting basic human rights, were highlighted during the interactions between
Indian dignitaries and HCHR.
India participated actively in the 52nd session of the Executive Committee of
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in October 2001
and highlighted issues of concern to developing countries. Indias statements
identified tackling of widespread abject poverty and deprivation around the globe,
enhancement of the capacities of developing countries and the link between
humanitarian assistance and long-term development as key inputs to any preventive
strategies in regard to refugee flows. India also highlighted its age-old commitment
to humanitarian traditions and the protection provided by it to a large number of
refugees since its independence.

Legal Issues
Pursuant to Resolutions 54/110 and 55/158 adopted by the General Assembly,
the Ad Hoc Committee and the Working Group of the Sixth Committee on Terrorism
continued their consideration of the draft comprehensive convention on international
terrorism proposed by India. Agreement was reached on almost all the substantive
provisions of the Draft Convention. However, differences continued on the exclusion
clause (Article 18), and on the definition of offences (Article 2).
The Sixth Committee adopted the Report of the International Law Commission,
the highlight of which was its finalization of the draft articles on State responsibility.
The Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade,
negotiated in UNCITRAL, was adopted and opened for signature. UNCITRAL also
completed work on the Model Law on Electronic Signatures and the Guide to
Enactment. The question of expansion of the membership of the UNCITRAL was
deferred to the next session as no agreement was reached on the distribution of
seats among the regional groups. Two new working groups of UNCITRAL were
established: on transport law and on security interests.
The General Assembly welcomed the decision of the States Parties to the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea to extend the ten-year time limit for making
89

United Nations and International Organisations

submissions on the extent of their continental shelves under Article 76. It also decided
to commemorate, on 9 & 10 December 2002, the twentieth anniversary of the
adoption and opening for signature of the Convention.
India continued to participate in the open-ended informal consultative process,
established by the General Assembly at its 54th session, to facilitate its annual review
of developments in ocean affairs. At its second session in May 2001, the informal
consultative process considered issues concerning marine scientific research and
acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships.
Observer status in the General Assembly was extended to the International
Development Law Institute, the International Hydrographic Organisation, and the
Community of Sahelo-Saharan States. The question of grant of observer status for
the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, Partners in
Population and Development, and for the Inter-Parliamentary Union were deferred
to the next session.

Financial Issues
At the 56th General Assembly, India continued to be an important player in
shaping the opinion of the G-77, and the Fifth Committee, on a wide range of
administrative, financial and budgetary reform issues. Its constructive proposals
won wide support, and helped build a consensus in the Committee.
The focus of discussions was on the regular budget of the United Nations for
2002-03. As against the current biennium budget of $2.533 billion, the SecretaryGeneral proposed an initial level of $2.648 billion. Adjusted for inflation, exchange
rate fluctuations, and Programme Budget Implications (PBIs) approved by the other
Main Committees, this rose to $2.695 billion. Although the developed countries, for
the first time in recent years, came together under the banner of an Expanded
Group to propose a budget of under $2.6 billion, the G-77 supported a proposal put
forward by India that was eventually approved by the Fifth Committee with some
amendments. The General Assembly eventually adopted a budget of $2.625 billion
for the biennium 2002-03.
After the United States repaid a part of its dues to the UN, the Government of
India received some of the arrears owed to it for its participation in UN peacekeeping.
90

Operational Activities of the UN System/UN Funds and Programmes
India continued to play a significant and constructive role in the work of the
UN Funds and Programmes. As a member of the Executive Boards of the UNDP/
UNFPA and UNICEF, India ensured that these organisations continued to focus on
their primary mandate to assist developing countries in their efforts, pursuant to
their national development plans and priorities, for sustainable development, in
particular, through projects directed at eradication of poverty; upliftment of women
and ensuring better reproductive health services; and the needs of children. India
ensured that CCA, UNDAF and harmonisation of procedures of different Funds and
Programmes did not lead to the introduction of conditionalities in the programmes
of developing countries and did not detract from the basic principle of nationallydriven programming.

Specialised Agencies

Non-aligned Movement

International Labour Organisation (ILO)

The Ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement was held on 14 November,
on the margins of the General Assembly. In his statement, Minister of External Affairs
Shri Jaswant Singh stressed the need for unity within the movement to collectively
address the global challenges such as terrorism, nuclear disarmament and poverty.
Following Bangladeshs withdrawal of its offer to host the next NAM Summit
scheduled for April 2002, India offered to host the Summit to save the Movement
from a crisis. However, as some other Asian countries made offer to host the Summit,
India withdrew its offer. Jordans offer to host was accepted by the Movement.

The 89th session of the International Labour Conference held during 5-21 June
2001 discussed, inter-alia, the Global Report on forced labour under the follow up to
the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Conference
also adopted a Convention and Recommendations concerning safety and health in
agriculture. The Indian delegation emphasised the need to take cognisance of resource
constraints faced by developing countries and factors such as poverty and
unemployment which hinder realisation of social goals embodied in ILO instruments.

Group of 77
The Group of 77 met throughout the year to prepare for meetings of the General
Assembly, ECOSOC and other bodies. The Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 on
the margins of the General Assembly was held on 16 November. India participated
actively in these meetings.

ESCAP
Indian delegation to the 57th annual session of the Economic and Social Council
for the Asia and Pacific was led by the Commerce Secretary. This years session mainly
focused on Social and Economic development issues, with the theme topic being
Balanced development of rural and urban areas and regions within the countries of
Asia and the Pacific. Other important issues which occupied attention of the
Commission were the financial crises currently being faced by some countries of the

International Law and Developments
The negotiations of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism (CCIT) proposed by India attracted enormous attention from the Legal
and Treaties Division this year as the matter is placed before the plenary of the 56th
Session of the UN General Assembly.
A record number of 167 delegations made statements on the item Measures to
Eliminate International Terrorism. While welcoming the Proposed Draft
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, the need for its early
finalization and adoption was emphasized. In the General Debate, also the main
focus was on the topic of terrorism. On the opening day of the session, the General
Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the terrorist attacks.
Elections to the Finance Committee and the Legal and Technical Commission of
the International Seabed Authority were held at its seventh session in July 2001.
India was re-elected to membership of both the bodies. Additional Secretary, Legal

Annual Report 2001-2002
Nodules, is now considering issues relating to regulations for prospecting and
exploration for polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts in the registered pioneer
investors for exploration of allotted sites in the international seabed area in
accordance with the Convention, the Agreement relating to Part XI, and the
Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the Area
(Mining Code).
Sixth (Legal) Committee of the UN General Assembly
The Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) has been
under active consideration in the Working Group of the Sixth Committee since last
year. During the current session, the draft CCIT was placed before the ad-hoc
Committee (from 12-23 February 2001) and the Working Group of the Sixth Committee
on Terrorism (15-26 October 2001). An agreement among the parties was reached on
all the substantive provisions of the Draft CCIT. However, the Convention could not
be finalized due to outstanding differences on the exclusion clause (Article 18). The
Article on definition of offences (Article 2) is also outstanding, as its adoption has
been linked to that of article 18.
Informal consultations, which continued after the meeting of the Working Group,
also failed to resolve the deadlock on this issue. According to the draft, an offence is
committed if a person lawfully and intentionally carries out an act intended to cause
death or serious bodily injury to any person, or serious damage to a State or
government facility, a public transportation system, or infrastructure facility with
the purpose compelling a government or an international organization to do or
abstain from carrying out any act. An accomplice of that person also commits an
offence, as also any person who organizes, directs or instigates others to do so,
according to the draft convention. The Convention would require States to make
such acts punishable as serious offences under their laws and to either extradite or
prosecute the accused persons. The draft Convention also provides for mutual legal
assistance in investigations and prosecution. States would also be required to prevent
installations and training camps in their territories, which are directed towards
commission of terrorist acts in other countries, and to take necessary measures to
prevent and suppress the preparation and financing of any acts of terrorism.
The Sixth Committee also had before it the following agenda items for
consideration: United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study,
Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law; Convention on

jurisdictional immunities of States and their property; Report of the United Nations
Commission of International Trade Law on the Work of its thirty-fourth session
(UNCITRAL); Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country;
Establishment of an International Criminal Court; Report of the Special Committee
on the Charter of the United Nations and on the International Terrorism; Scope of
legal protection under the Convention on Safety; of United Nations and Associated
Personnel and the proposal for an International Convention against the reproductive
cloning of human law.
The Report of the International Law Commission of the draft articles on the
topic of State responsibility, one of the earliest topics identified for codification, was
adopted. The draft Articles have been commended by the States for consideration.
The item Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts will be taken
up by the General Assembly at its fifty ninth session to consider the possibility of
convening an international conference of plenipotentiaries to examine the draft
articles with a view to convening a convention on the topic.
The Indian delegation made statements on the relevant items in the Sixth
Committee in respect of the subjects of Charter Committee, Report of the International
Law Commission, Report of the United National Commission on International Trade
Law, scope of the Legal Protection under the Convention on Safety of United Nations
and Associated Personnel, and on the grant of observer status to the Inter
Parliamentary Union. Indias delegation also made statements in the General
Assembly on the items relating to international terrorism and the Law of the Sea.
Charter Committee
The Commission also completed its second reading of Draft articles on
Prevention of transboundary harm from hazardous activities for which Additional

treaties, diplomatic protection, and unilateral acts.
The resolution on implementation of the Charter provisions relating to assistance
to third States affected by the application of sanctions, and its possible considerations
in a working group of the Sixth Committee at the next UNGA was adopted.

practical arrangements for the establishment and early coming into operation of
the International Criminal Court. The Preparatory Commission has so far finalized
the draft rules of procedure and evidence and elements of crimes, the draft
Relationship Agreement between the Court and the United Nations, the draft
Agreement on Privileges and Immunities, the draft Rules of Procedure of the Assembly
of States Parties and the draft Financial Regulations. It is presently considering the

establishment of an international criminal court, which will hold two meetings of
two weeks each, during 2002 was adopted.
UNCITRAL
A draft UNCITRAL Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International
Trade was adopted and opened for signature. The UNCITRALs work on the Model
Law on Electronic signatures and the Guide to Enactment were also completed.
Two new working groups of UNCITRAL were established on transport law and
on security interests. The working group on transport law will consider issues
concerning the scope of application of a possible future legislative instrument on
the subject, including questions of the carriers obligations, transport documents,
freight, delivery to the consignee, rights of parties in the cargo during carriage,
transfer of rights in goods, and time bar for actions against the carrier. The working
group which is mandated to consider issues concerning an efficient legal regime for
94

security rights in goods involved in a commercial activity, including inventory, such
as the form of security, assets which can serve as collateral, the degree of formalities
to be complied with, an existence of security rights, effects of bankruptcy and the
certainty and predictability of the creditors priority over competing interests.
Oceans and The Law of the SEA
In the present session, a resolution was adopted welcoming the decision of the
States Parties to the UN Convention on Law of the Sea to extend the 10 year time
limit for making submissions on the extent of their continental shelves under article
76. The General Assembly also decided to commemorate, on 9 & 10 December 2002
at its next session, the twentieth anniversary of the adoption and opening for
signature of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea.
International Law Commission
The International Law Commission at its 53rd Session held in Geneva in two
parts from 23 April to 1 June 2001 and 2 July to 10 August 2001 completed its work
on two important subjects:
r

State Responsibility for Internationally wrongful Acts; and

r

Prevention of significant trans-boundary harm arising from hazardous activities.

On the subject of State Responsibility, the Commission recommended that the
draft Articles finalized by the Commission in their second reading be taken note of
in the first instance by the UN General Assembly before Sates could decide upon the
form in which these Articles could be adopted, for example either in the form of an
international convention on in any other suitable from.

he Economic Division provided a standard backstopping arrangement and a
nodal point for addressing the concerns of Indian exporters and industry by
constantly providing and seeking timely inputs to and from Indian Missions.
The information dissemination also related to inquiries from Indian Missions and
providing to them the informational wherewithal to carry out their economic and
commercial functions effectively. These ranged from simple trade inquiries, to details
about Indian policy, legislation and procedures on various aspects of trade and
investment. The Ministry upgraded its information base by introducing new
databases on Indian economy, trade, investments, technology related aspects and
opportunities for Indian companies abroad and foreign investors in India.
The Ministry rendered valuable assistance in the trade promotion efforts of
government bodies and industry associations in promoting the participation of
foreign business in Indian trade fairs and Indian business in foreign trade fairs,
seminars, road shows, buyer seller meets etc. Indias trade and economic relations
with other countries continued to register steady growth. During the year the
Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Missions abroad interacted with and assisted
business and industrial houses in promoting foreign trade and Indian investment abroad
Being the export promotion cell of the Ministry, Economic Division received a
number of trade complaints both from Indian and foreign companies which were
promptly attended to in consultation with Indian missions and agencies concerned
with trade and commerce.
96

The Ministry was associated with a number of economic policy making bodies,
both inter ministerial and public sector undertaking/industry associations. This
enabled the Ministry to provide the political as well as larger regional and global
perspectives on policy issues from the vantage point of having direct contact with
and knowledge of comparable policies and issues in other countries.
The European union continued to be Indias principal trading partner. The other
major trading partners were the USA, Japan, China, Brazil, UAE and Russia. Major
commodities of Indian exports included agricultural and allied products, marine
products, iron ore, leather goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and related products, engineering goods, electronic goods and textiles.
Exchanges of trainees between India and other developing countries under the
Colombo Plan and Technical Co-operation Programmes continued. The Ministry
continued to interact closely with various governmental and other bodies in the
matter of promoting exports and overseas investments. It was represented in the
governing bodies of organisations, such as, OCCI, ITPO, IRCON Ltd., WAPCOS and
ONGC Videsh Ltd.
India utilised surplus stocks of wheat for exports, mostly to African and a few
Asian countries on a grant basis. These are Egypt, Republic of Yemen, Oman, Libya,
Ethiopia and Eritrea, Bangladesh, Ghana and Madagascar. Emphasis was laid on
timely and quality supply at fair prices.
The single largest item in Indias export basket was diamonds. India being the
largest exporter of cut and polished diamonds in the world. Diamond exports from

Annual Report 2001-2002
India multiplied 1200 times in a span of 30 years. India processes nearly 70 per cent
of the rough diamonds mined in the world and contributes to 50 per cent of the
world diamond market in value terms.
India made great strides in the pharmaceuticals industry and is now one of the
leading exporters of pharmaceuticals. Indian medicines and formulations penetrated
markets in all the developed and developing countries of the world. Though growth
in the export of Indian pharmaceuticals in recent years was quite impressive, Indian
pharmaceutical exporters encountered difficulties in registration of Indian drugs
and non-tariff barriers.
Export promotion activities included the holding of a number of trade fairs,
exhibitions and seminars both at home and abroad. Indian companies and enterprises
participated in several trade promotion events abroad. Indian Missions abroad made
all possible efforts to ensure wide participation of foreign enterprises in trade
promotion events in India and for Indian enterprises in events abroad. The Missions
themselves organised a number of trade fairs/exhibitions with a view to promoting
Indias exports.
With the Ministry's support CII organised the Second International Conference
on India: Tourism and Heritage  Challenges of 21st Century from 18-20 October
2001 in New Delhi.
India and Indonesia signed an agreement on cooperation in information
technology, the construction of a sugar mill, the development of off shore oil rigs
and gas drilling during the visit of Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee to
Indonesia this year.
A delegation from the Confederation of Indian industry (CII) visited China from
18-24 November 2001 to promote the export of an entire range of agriculture related
products i.e. from tractors to food processing and milk products etc.
The Ministry continued its policy of supporting and promoting Indian investment
abroad. The Government of India has been progressively simplifying the procedures
for granting approval to proposal of overseas investment. The Ministry worked with
other governmental bodies, business houses and Indian missions abroad to explore
the possibilities of widening and expanding Indias overseas investment.

After the May 1998 nuclear tests by India, the U.S.A. and some other countries
had imposed sanctions on India but in September 2000, the U.S.A. lifted sanctions as
did Japan. As a result of the lifting of sanctions, foreign and multilateral assistance
would be available for developmental activities.
The Ministry was actively associated in providing inputs and international
perspectives as well as political - economic assessment in deliberations of various
Joint Business Council/Joint Commission Meetings.
The Ministry has been contributing to management and prevention problems
and issues affecting Indian trade. The division actively participated in coordinating
efforts of the concerned Ministries, EPCS and trade associations along with those of
the Missions to urgently take up the issues at the appropriate fora to safeguard the
interests of Indian exports.

Multilateral Economic Relations
During the year under review, India continued to press for the legitimate interests
of developing countries in various international organisations and multilateral,
regional and sub-regional groupings. India emphasised important economic and
financial issues, such as redressal of the imbalances resulting from the various
Uruguay Round Agreements, reform of the international financial architecture,
strengthening of the multilateral trading system with a focus on developmental
issues, etc. India stressed the importance of cooperation among developing countries
on economic, financial and technical issues through speedy implementation of agreed
projects and work programmes. Besides, India flagged attention to the need for a
mechanism for a sustained and structured North-South dialogue on issues relating
to trade, investment, technology flows and aid.
At the annual Summit of the Group of Fifteen (G-15), held in Jakarta on 30 & 31
May 2001, India played an active role. Vice President, Shri Krishan Kant, who led the
Indian delegation pointed out the problems being faced by developing countries by
the slowing down of the leading world economies, and the outstanding
implementation problems relating to the various Uruguay Round Agreements. On
investment issues, India drew attention to the fact that investors seemed generally
oblivious to the development needs of the host countries. At the retreat for the
Heads of State and Government, where the theme was North-South Dialogue, Vice
97

Foreign Economic Relations

President forcefully articulated Indias views, including the need for a structured
dialogue at the level of Trade and Foreign Ministers between the G-15 and G-8.
The principal theme of the G-15 Summit pertained to the use of information
and communication technologies (ICT) for development. The main Summit was
preceded by meetings at the level of Trade and Foreign Ministers, where India was
represented by Commerce Secretary, and then Minister of State for External Affairs,
Shri U.V. Krishnam Raju, respectively. Venezuela assumed the Chairmanship of G-15
from Indonesia at the Summit. The member countries expressed concern at the global
economic slowdown, and called for the reform of the International Financial
Architecture in order to ensure more stable global financial markets and stable and
sustainable private capital flows to developing countries. The group also reiterated
its commitment to an open, just and equitable multilateral trading system, rejected
the inclusion of non-trade issues in the WTO agenda, and highlighted the urgent
need for implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements. It was felt that trade
should not be seen as an end in itself but rather as an instrument of development,
and development objectives accorded higher priority in the WTO vis-à-vis the purely
trade-liberalisation objectives per se. Industrialised countries were urged to eliminate
tariff and non-tariff barriers to products and services of export interest to developing
countries, particularly in textiles, agriculture and services. The G-15 also underlined
the imperative need to review the TRIPs agreement to ensure that it did not conflict
with the objective of promoting public health. It was further decided to set up a G15 Task Force on ICT for Development.
A G-15 Trade and Information Technology Exhibition was held on the margins
of the Summit. A number of reputed Indian companies participated, for instance,
HMT, NIIT, Aditya Birla Group. The Indian companies were able to have fruitful contact
with their counterpart companies in Indonesia.
The G-15 Summit also decided to establish a G-15 Commission to identify
practical measures for increasing the efficiency of the G-15 in implementing its
decisions. At the G-15 Foreign Ministers Meeting, held subsequently in New York on
15 November 2001, the Commission was constituted as an open-ended 9-member
body at the level of the Personal Representatives of the Heads of State and
Government. The members are: Algeria, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Zimbabwe,
Nigeria, Peru and Venezuela.
98

India continued to participate actively in all endeavours of the Group of 77 (G77) aimed at promoting South-South cooperation, in accordance with the Buenos
Aires Plan of Action on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (1978),
the Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Cooperation among Developing
Countries (1981) and the San Jose Declaration and Plan of Action on South-South
Trade, Investment and Finance (1997). The developments pertaining to globalisation
of the world economy during the past few years only strengthen the rationale for
intensifying G-77 cooperation. India supports G-77 activities that address issues of
common concern to developing countries in respect of globalisation, reform of the
international financial architecture, and monitoring the interests of developing
countries in international organisations such as the WTO and the Bretton Woods
institutions.
The 10th Meeting of the Inter-governmental Follow-up and Coordination
Committee (IFCC-X) on Economic and Technical Cooperation among Developing
Countries (ECDC/TCDC) of the Group of 77 (G-77) was held in Tehran on 18-23 August
2001. The meeting adopted the Tehran Consensus. Reports on sectoral themes 
Trade, Finance, Knowledge, Technology and TCDC; and, Food & Agriculture,
Industrialisation, Energy & Raw Materials, were also adopted. It was agreed that the
G-77 will convene meetings on these sectoral themes. At the meeting, India suggested
that an inventory of ongoing ECDC/TCDC projects as well as proposals made in
previous meetings of the South be compiled and the status of their implementation
and the scope for rationalisation discussed. This would help the G-77 in arriving at
a faithful assessment of our collective capabilities, which will ultimately translate
into better implementation of South-South Cooperation projects.
The annual meeting of Foreign Ministers of G-77 was held in New York on 16
November 2001. The meeting adopted a declaration focussing on developmental
issues, North-South Dialogue, etc. The forthcoming International Conference on
Financing for Development, to be held in Monterey, Mexico, in March 2002 and the
Summit on Sustainable Development, scheduled to be held on 2-11 September 2002
in Johannesburg also figured prominently in the discussions. Several countries also
drew attention to the problem of high indebtedness of some developing countries.
Indias linkages with the countries of South and Southeast Asia in economic,
financial, scientific and technical issues were also strengthened, in pursuance of

Annual Report 2001-2002
Indias Look East policy. At the sub-regional and regional levels, cooperation under
BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka Thailand  Economic Cooperation),
MGC (Mekong-Ganga Cooperation), and under the ASEAN-India Dialogue Partnership
was carried forward.
The MGC, which comprises India, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Lao PDR and
Cambodia, is an initiative launched in Vientiane in November 2000 for cooperation
in Culture, Tourism, Human Resource Development, and Transport and
Communication. India participated in the 2nd MGC Ministerial Meeting, held in Hanoi
on 28 July 2001, where the Hanoi Programme of Action for MGC was adopted. This
Action Programme draws up the work programme for six years in the areas identified
for cooperation under the MGC. In his statement, Deputy Chairman of the Planning
Commission, Shri K.C. Pant, who led the Indian delegation, offered cooperation in
projects relating to flood control and management, the setting up of a Museum of
Traditional Textiles in Cambodia, teaching of English, and in other fields such as
museology and conservation. India also offered free space to MGC countries to
participate in the World Book Fair and the Handicrafts and Gifts Fair held annually in
New Delhi. The Meeting also recognised the importance of making adequate
provisions for financing cooperation projects.
Cooperation in BIMST-EC, a sub-regional economic cooperation grouping of
countries on the rim of the Bay of Bengal, forms an important component of Indias
Look East policy, and represents the reinforcement of Indias relations with two of
its South Asian neighbours and its link with ASEAN. India participated in the 4th
BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting, held in Yangon on 21 December 2001. Minister of
State for Commerce & Industry, Shri Rajeev Pratap Rudy led the Indian delegation.
The meeting undertook a comprehensive assessment of BIMST-EC, including the
status of functional cooperation in the six sectors of Energy, Fisheries, Technology,
Tourism, Trade & Investment, and Transport and Communications. Allocation of
Lead Country functions was reorganised  the Lead Country for a particular sector
has the responsibility for coordinating cooperation in that sector. India is the Lead
Country for the Tourism and Transport and Communication sectors.
Ministers also stressed the importance of the proposal for a BIMST-EC Free Trade
Area, which will be considered further in a meeting scheduled in New Delhi on 1718 January 2002. An important BIMST-EC project in tourism is the Visit BIMST-EC

Year in 2003. The need for BIMST-EC to strengthen its linkages with business and
industry, and academia, was emphasised. It was felt that the BIMST-EC Business
Forum and the Economic Forum should meet regularly in order to promote the
participation of the private sector in BIMST-EC projects and activities and interaction
between governments and the private sector. BIMST-EC has also proposed
strengthening linkages among think tanks in BIMST-EC with the Research and
Information System for Non-aligned and other Developing Countries (RIS), New Delhi,
taking the lead in this direction. Issues concerning the structure and frequency of
BIMST-EC meetings were also considered. It was felt that future Ministerial meetings
should be held at full Ministerial level, as against the Minister of State level at present.
The issue of funding for BIMST-EC projects received attention. It was decided that
some BIMST-EC projects would be selected, for which possibilities of external funding,
especially from UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for the
Asia and Pacific) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), would be explored. Also, the
need for establishing a permanent secretariat for BIMST-EC would be studied. In the
field of BIMST-EC cooperation in non-conventional energy, India announced that it
would give equipment and technical expertise to Myanmar for setting up a biomass gassifier project in Myanmar, and also depute experts to assist Myanmar in
setting up the BIMST-EC Energy Information Centre, which will serve as a basic
database on energy issues for BIMST-EC.
Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission, Shri K.C. Pant led the Indian delegation
to the ASEAN-Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) 10+10 and 10+1 meetings, held in
Hanoi from 26-28 July 2001. The main issues for discussion at the ASEAN PMC 10+10
Meeting were the global economic slow down and the Initiative for ASEAN Integration
(IAI), launched by ASEAN to bridge the intra-ASEAN developmental gap and to
promote the integration of the new members into ASEAN, namely, Cambodia, Lao
PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). India expressed its commitment to the IAI and
offered to extend its cooperation in respect of programmes connected with the CLMV.
At the 10+1 Meeting, ASEAN appreciated Indias commitment to ASEAN and Indias
keenness to promote linkages with ASEAN in diverse fields. ASEAN also appreciated
Indias focus on the IAI, especially in relation to projects in IT, HRD and S&T for the
CLMV countries. In his statement, Shri K.C. Pant outlined a portfolio of cooperation
projects covering biotechnology, teaching of English, Computer literacy, advanced

materials, technology competitiveness, space imagery for flood forecasting and
control, health and pharmaceuticals, commercialisation of indigenously developed
technologies, etc. He also proposed a joint meeting of the Trade Ministers of ASEAN
countries and India for the promotion of trade and investment linkages. Indias offer
for cooperation in such a broad range of activities was highly appreciated by ASEAN,
more so because the projects mentioned were specific, relevant and concrete,
emphasising a practical turn of mind.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, delivered a
lecture in New Delhi on 15 September 2001 under the ASEAN-India Eminent Persons
Lecture Series Programme on the topic ASEAN-India Dialogue Relations: Present
and Prospects. The lecture was well-received and the audience, which included
eminent persons from industry, academia and the diplomatic corps, found his remarks
very illuminating.
India participated in the 6th ASEAN Science and Technology Week, held in Brunei
Darussalaam from 17-21 September 2001. The event was attended by about 300
participants from both ASEAN and its Dialogue Partners. The Indian delegation
presented papers in the areas of advanced materials, space applications for disaster
management, Ayurveda and medicinal plants and natural dyes, as well as on
Technology Management for Global Competitiveness. In the S&T Exhibition, India
displayed about fifty products developed and commercialised indigenously: e.g.,
natural dyes, high-technology titanium products, composite materials and ceramics,
etc. The event afforded India a good platform for disseminating information among
the ASEAN countries in its S&T achievements and for showcasing its technological
capabilities through such products.
Indias growing and diverse interaction with ASEAN led to the adoption of a
proposal by the seventh ASEAN Summit, held in Brunei on 5 & 6 November 2001 to
hold the first ever India-ASEAN Summit. India has welcomed the ASEAN decision,
which would mark a major milestone in India-ASEAN cooperation.
The Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) is a
regional cooperation initiative aimed at expansion of trade and investment among
the countries of the Indian Ocean region. IOR-ARC was established in Mauritius in
March 1997 and at present consists of 19 members: Australia, India, Kenya, Mauritius,
100

Oman, Singapore, South Africa, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mozambique, Sri
Lanka, Tanzania, Yemen, Bangladesh, Iran, Seychelles, Thailand and United Arab
Emirates. India is a founder member. India is coordinating a number of IOR-ARC
projects and continued to play an active role in the various IOR-ARC programmes
and activities.
The Third Meeting of the Council of Ministers of the (IOR-ARC) was held on 7 &
8 April 2001 in Muscat, Oman, preceded by the meetings of the Committee of Senior
Officials, the Working Group on Trade and Investment, the Indian Ocean Rim Business
Forum (IOR-BF) and the Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group (IOR-AG).
At the meeting, Oman assumed the Chairmanship of the IOR-ARC from
Mozambique for a period of two years. The Meeting recognised the need, among
other things, to consolidate the organisation from within, particularly in identifying
and prioritising the areas of co-operation in line with the core trade and investment
agenda of the Association. The Meeting considered the Work Programme of the IORARC, consisting of cooperative projects under the IOR-AG, IOR-BF and the WGTI. It
was decided to establish a High-Level Task-Force (HLTF) to study the future direction
of IOR-ARC, organisational structure and funding of the Secretariat, including the
modalities for contribution by the member states, and the Rules and Procedures for
the appointment of the Director, etc. Noting that trade facilitation was one of the
main pillars of trade expansion in IOR-ARC region, the meeting discussed new areas
of cooperation in trade facilitation, such as identification of non-tariff barriers,
simplification of visa procedures for businessmen, study on FDI and Agricultural
Trade and Liberalisation, etc. Indias proposal to hold workshops on the use of IT
and e-commerce in trade facilitation was noted.
India also offered to hold workshops on maritime transport issues, and disaster
mitigation & management. The meeting noted the ongoing projects of IOR-Business
Centre and IORNET, as well as future projects by the IOR-BF on information, and
communication technology, e-business, training/ re-training and skill development,
and entrepreneurship development. Energy was identified as an important area of
cooperation for securing stable economic growth, in view of the growing demand
for energy resources, mainly fossil fuels, in the region. Iran was designated as the
lead country for preparing a compendium, including information on investment

Annual Report 2001-2002
capacities and requirements in this area. The meeting welcomed the IOR-BFs proposal
of Strategic Vision of the IORBF over the period 2002-2007 to chart out the
perspective of the business sector on ways and means to further cooperation. The
new activities proposed by the IOR-AG were welcomed. These include projects on
Promotion of Trade Generating FDI among IOR-ARC Countries, with Special Reference
to Intra-IOR-ARC Sources of Outward Investment, Study on Marine Pollution, etc.
Indias interactions with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) also increased considerably in the year under review, with
India obtaining membership of the OECD Development Centre (ODC). The OECD has
initiated a dialogue with emerging economies on important economic and trade
issues. India participates in the OECD Special Dialogue with non-member economies
and in several OECD events pertaining to SMEs, taxation, global biodiversity,
agriculture, corruption, competition policy, harmful tax practices, etc. India also
attended the Meeting of the Advisory Board of the ODC in Paris on 3 December 2001.

Trade and Investment Promotion

6

he Central Government and the State Governments took several initiatives
and measures during the year aimed at encouraging foreign investment
inflows, particularly the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India.
Major thrust areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power,
telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment Technology
Promotion Division to actively undertake effective investment promotion and
publicity efforts, particularly through the Indian Missions and Posts abroad for
attracting foreign investment into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in
the Missions are the first point of contact for the foreign investor. It is, therefore,
essential that the Missions are given full back-up support in their efforts in the form
of providing up-to-date information about the economy, the liberalised policies and
the procedures, the project and opportunities available in different sectors, the
incentives offered by the Central Government and various State Governments etc.
Missions are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of delays
in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of other hurdles faced in the
implementation of projects. For all these and related matters the Investment
Technology Promotion (ITP) Division in the Ministry acted as a nodal point of contact
and coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication between the
Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments or other agencies, as the
case may be.

104

Policy
The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever required, based
on investment trends world-wide and based on the need to maintain harmony
between foreign policy objectives and Indias economic policies. Regular feedback
was received from the Missions on foreign investor perceptions about Indias
investment policies or about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving
as inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an existing one, if
the same was considered necessary in the national interest.
The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of Foreign Investment
Promotion Board (FIPB) and Foreign Investment Implementation Authority (FIIA) in
collaboration with the Ministries and State Governments. In FIPB, the Ministry was
represented by Secretary(ER) and investments from NRIs were given particular
attention. In FIIA, specific policy measures to speed up the investment were taken
up with concerned Ministries and State Governments.

Promotional Efforts and Initiatives
The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably projecting the
various investment policies and announcements of the Government by coordinating
with the Missions on the one hand and various economic Ministries of the Central
Government and State Governments on the other. Weekly Economic News Bulletin
highlighting major policy decisions and new opportunities were sent to all Missions

Annual Report 2001-2002
to keep them abreast of developments. Despatch of Weekly Economic News Bulletin
by e-mail ensured fast and cost effective transmission. Missions were also encouraged
to hold investment promotion seminars and workshops besides extending
investment support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points
etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of Indian Missions
in identified target countries. Ministry also undertook special efforts to highlight
the policies, procedures and opportunities available in the Information Technology
sector.
The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations including those
sponsored by the State Governments by arranging suitable meetings with potential
investors, local Government officials and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products
Associations. After successful launching of INDIACHEM-2000, it was planned to
organise INDIACHEM-2002 in September 2002. INDIACHEM was an Indian trade fair
organised in New Delhi to promote and showcase the potential of Indian chemical
industry. ITP Division functioned as the nodal point from the Ministry of External
Affairs for promotion of INDIACHEM in foreign countries and assisted the delegation
sent by Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers in arranging their meetings in foreign
countries.

dealt with the issues related to IT implementation in MEA such as provision of
computers to all sections, development of data bases of information in section,
network within the section, networking at Division level, application software for
networking and data bases, Internet and e-mail facilities, computers and internet
facilities at the residence of joint secretaries and above, computerization of Missions,
delivery of public services/websites, training etc. IT Task Force also dealt with
implementation of minimum agenda for e-governance approved by High Powered
Committee, an Inter-ministerial body coordinated by the Department of
Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. ITP Division further dealt with various
technology related issues with potential international ramification such as cyber
crime. ITP Division provided inputs to other Divisions on negotiations with other
countries involving application of high-technology such as establishment of energy
transfer through international pipeline. ITP Division was nodal the Division in the
Ministry of External Affairs for promotion of tourism and acted as an interface
between Indian Missions abroad and Department of Tourism and other agencies in
India engaged in tourism promotion. Many Indian Missions organised India Food
Festivals and other tourism promotion events. They maintained close contact with
Government of India Tourism offices abroad.

The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by the Missions,
visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having appropriate meetings with
concerned Government Departments, the Apex Chambers of Commerce, the State
Governments etc. The Ministry also participated in many bilateral or other meetings/
conferences involving overseas investor groups.

Agreements

Publicity

The Ministry also participated in the negotiations relating to Bilateral Civil
Aviation matters with other countries. The Ministry provided legal inputs, as required,
and also tendered advice based on the need for increased civil aviation links
particularly without neighbouring regions to evolve in consonance with the initiatives
being taken on the foreign policy front. During the year, Air Services Agreement/
Memorandum of Understanding were signed with UAE, Switzerland, Tajikistan,
Austria and Oman.

The ITP Division was in the process of printing 30,000 copies of India Business
Opportunities brochures. This was an updated version of last years edition. The
brochures were meant for distribution to potential foreign investors through Indian
Missions on regular occasion and especially during VVIP visits.

Technology Aspects and Other Issues
JS(ITP) was a member of the IT Task Force of Ministry of External Affairs which

The Ministry participated in the negotiations for drawing up of Bilateral
Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs) and Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) that were held in respect of a number of countries.
During the year, BIPPA was signed with Croatia. India signed DTAA with Malaysia.

Policy Planning and Research

T

he Policy Planning & Research Division serves as a nodal point for interaction
with the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) formerly known as the
Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the University Grants Commission (UGC)
and its affiliates and the Area Study Centres (ASC) located in various universities and
specializing in research on various regions of the world.
The Division extended financial assistance to various academic institutions/
think tanks located in different parts of the country for holding conferences, seminars,
preparation of research papers, exchange of scholars and support for Track-II
programmes on issues related to Indias external relations and security. A list of
seminars/conferences/meetings organized by institutions/NGOs partly funded by
the Policy Planning & Research Division is given at Annexure-XII
The subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects covered Indian
Ocean Island States, Racism, Conflict resolution, India and the Indian Diaspora, India
and West Asia, Indian Ocean, Global terrorism and Indias bilateral relations with
countries like Japan, Korea, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Israel, Iran, China,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Support was also extended to Indian scholars/experts
attending seminars, workshops and conferences in Korea and Brazil.
A separate budget head for funding the activities of CSCAP-India Committee
was created this year. Regular meetings of the CSCAP-India chapter were held and
financial assistance was provided to the delegates participating in various CSCAP
meetings held in Kuala Lumpur and Wellington. A list of CSCAP meetings in which
Indian delegates participated with financial assistance provided by PP Division, is
given at Annexure-XIII.
106

PP Division also provided an annual recurring grant of Rs. 2 lakhs to the Centre
for Advanced Strategic Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, USA (CASI),
an institute dedicated to the study of modern India. The Centres main purpose is to
create a unique institution aimed at linking American and Indian academics,
professional and policy makers for potential scholarly, economic, technological and
political cooperation. The annual grant to CASI is being provided since 1992.
To further strengthen Ministrys capabilities in research and analyses, the
Division had last year prepared a detailed proposal for revival of the Research cadre
as recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs.
However, because of the existing policy of right sizing the bureaucracy, scaling down
of non-plan expenditure and continued ban on creation of new posts, the proposal
was not pursued further. Nevertheless, in view of the continuing relevance of the
role of the Historical Division, it was recommended that the Division would be revived
and headed by a Director under the overall supervision of Additional Secretary(PP).
The Research Section of the Division continued to edit and publish the Annual
Report of the Ministry. The report served as a compendium of Indias interaction
with the rest of the world in the political, economic and cultural fields, including
the views of the government on various facets of international relations.
The Division rendered all possible assistance to territorial divisions as well as
Indian missions abroad whenever any specific information or documents on
international relations was required. The Research Section examined the depiction
of Indias international boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction

Annual Report 2001-2002
were taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through Indian
missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The division also scrutinized
foreign publications containing maps depicting India external boundaries before
these were imported in to the country and offered its views to the Ministries dealing
with the matter. It coordinated the supply of map-sheets to various Government
and semi-Government agencies for use in their official work with the Survey of
India and the Ministry of Defence. The Research Section dealt with requests from
research scholars for access to the records of the Ministry.
There are about six lakh files, both classified and unclassified, lying in the Records
Management section of the Ministry. RM Section has been sending old files for
reviewing regularly to the concerned officers for taking a decision regarding retention
or otherwise of these files. 2130 files which were no longer required have been
destroyed by burning.

External Publicity

he foreign policy priorities outlined in Indias interaction and engagement
with the major powers, Indias neighbours, traditional friends and partners,
and the crucial global struggle against terrorism governed the functions of
the External Publicity Division.
The heightened global awareness of the scourge of terrorism following the events
of 11 September 2001 enabled India as an active constituent country in the world
coalition against terrorism to project in a serious and sustained manner, Indias
resolute determination and resolve to resist and eliminate terrorism. Emphasis was
placed in this context, on the threat to peace, security, democracy and development
by cross border terrorism operating against India in the wake of the terrorist attack
on the Jammu & Kashmir Legislative Assembly of 1 October, and the terrorist attack
on Indias Parliament of 13 December 2001.
The Ministry was actively involved in the articulation of Indias concerns and
perspectives on terrorism, international peace, security and disarmament, and
economic issues, and in building greater awareness and understanding of Indias
policies and national interest.

The Prime Ministers decision to resume dialogue with Pakistan, reflecting Indias
consistent desire to build a relationship of durable peace, stability and cooperative
friendship with Indias western neighbour and inviting Gen. Pervez Musharraf to
India to walk the high road to peace together at the Agra summit in July 2001, was
a bold and principled initiative. The Indian commitment to dialogue with Pakistan
was widely recognized and applauded, both by world leadership and by media across
the globe.
108

The year witnessed hectic diplomatic activity as was evident in the hitherto
unprecedented degree of engagements of Indian leadership with world leaders
including those from the USA, Russian Federation, UK, France and Germany. The
interactions provided an opportunity for India to project her views and concerns on
a gamut of issues and to give substance and ballast to the dialogue architecture
drawn up with several key countries. The Ministry disseminated substantive
information on major incoming and outgoing visits and on other significant events
witnessed during the year. Fresh impetus was imparted to the traditionally close
and time tested mutually reinforcing strategic ties with the Russian Federation with
the return visit of Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee to that country. Greater
depth was added to India-US relations and wider understanding reached on the
issue of counter-terrorism during Prime Ministers visit to Washington in November
2001. The visit to London before returning home from the U.S. gave Prime Minister
an opportunity for further consultations on the Afghanistan crisis with the British
Prime Minister. Prime Ministers visit to Japan highlighted that economic cooperation
and strategic convergence were the touch-stones of bilateral relations. India and
European Union continued to interact at the highest level during the Second IndiaEU Summit in New Delhi on 23 November 2001 in which the agenda was set to
develop full potential of relations, address global challenges together and further
economic and development cooperation. Anticipating the enthusiasm of the media,
especially Indian, at the 11th SAARC Summit in Kathmandu adequate measures were
taken by this ministry by way of exclusive Media Centre for the Indian media

Annual Report 2001-2002
contingent and regular briefings. Information to the Indian media which numbered
nearly 200 was provided almost on full time basis.
11 September 2001 was a landmark in the history of modern world. India, having
been a victim of state-sponsored cross-border terrorism for over two decades,
condemned this dastardly crime of terrorism against humanity and reiterated its
commitment to fight and defeat the menace of terrorism.
The Spokespersons office held daily briefings in order to regularly articulate
Indias position in the wake of 11 September attacks. Formal and informal interaction
with both the Indian and foreign media was held at various levels to project India as
a leading member of the international alliance against terrorism. Indias initiatives
over the years to combat terrorism were also repeatedly highlighted as for example
Indias resolute efforts to see the conclusion of negotiations on the Indian initiative
for a Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism (CCIT) and Indias
bilateral interaction with key countries on this issue.
Prime Ministers address to the nation wherein he stated that every Indian has
to be a part of this global war on terrorism and that India must, and India will,
stamp out this evil from Indian land, and from the world  was disseminated across
the world through key print and electronic media organizations. Statements,
interviews and press briefings by the Minister of External Affairs and the Minister
of State as well as responses at official press briefings were widely circulated to all
media as well as posted on Website of the Ministry of External Affairs.
India projected a holistic and positive approach for solving the crisis in
Afghanistan and the establishment of a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully
representative political structure in post conflict Afghanistan. Indias position was
highlighted in consultations with world leaders including the UK Prime Minister
Mr. Tony Blair, German Chancellor Mr. Gerhard Schroeder, the US Secretary of State
Mr. Colin Powell, Secretary of Defence Mr. Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Chairman of the
Russian Federation Mr. Ilya Klebanov, Foreign Minister of Greece Mr. George
Papandreou and the French Foreign Minister Mr. Hubert Vedrine who visited India,
and the visits of Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the Russian Federation,
USA and the UK and that of the Minister of External Affairs, Shri Jaswant Singh to
France, USA, Germany and to the UK. Indias assistance and support for the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan were welcomed universally.

The Official Spokesperson articulated and projected Indias views and concerns
on various national and international issues through official statements, daily press
briefings and public/media relations efforts. Over 205 official statements and press
releases were issued by the Ministry during the period 2001-2002 and circulated to
Indian and foreign media, foreign missions in Delhi and posted on the Ministrys
Website.
The Ministrys Website served as a vital tool for dissemination of information
by the office of the Spokesperson. The Website was updated on a daily basis in
regard to issues relating to foreign policy, records of daily briefings, news reports of
interest, op-eds, speeches & interviews of dignitaries etc. New sections were created
on the home page on important events giving detailed information including official
statements, articles and opinions and related photographs. The Website was widely
accessed both inside and outside India and hyper-linked to all Websites of all Indian
Missions and Posts, Ministries as well as prestigious international agencies. In
response to the technological developments in the international media environment,
the Ministry took a special initiative to launch a weekly electronic newswire in
December 2001. MEA Newswire is a weekly update of Government of India position
on important foreign and national security issues. The Newswire targets apart from
international and national media, eminent decision makers, think tanks and India
watchers across the globe.
Given the mega media opportunities that arose during the year, increased
numbers of foreign media teams visited India. The Kumbh Mela in Prayag attracted
wide media attention the world over. On a more somber note, the earthquake in
Gujarat also saw the media from all across the globe taking keen interest in reporting
the devastation and reconstruction and rehabilitation. Indias invitation to Pakistans
President and the Summit at Agra also evoked unprecedented interest, particularly
amongst the international visual media. The terrorist strikes in New York and
subsequent developments in Afghanistan generated numerous visits to Delhi, at all
levels, from foreign leaders for consultations. International media also bolstered
their presence in India to cover the war in Afghanistan. The India-EU Summit in
November evoked significant media interest. The terrorist attack on Parliament also
attracted a significant number of foreign journalists to India. The External Publicity
Division was involved in providing facilities to the increased inflow of media persons
covering all these events.

External Publicity
This Ministry processed the clearance of documentary proposals from foreign
production houses and international TV channels. This year 307 proposals were
received from all over the world. Nearly 300 of these proposals were cleared on
receipt, while the others were at various stages of processing, awaiting approvals of
other central and state Government departments. Steps were initiated to further
simplify and streamline procedures involved in the clearance of documentary film
proposals.
Under the Ministry's ongoing programme of familiarization visits, senior foreign
journalists and editors were invited to the country for exposure to different aspects
of contemporary India. The year 2001 witnessed the visits of 93 journalists,
individually or as part of media delegations from various countries, including
Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Bahrain, Russia, Jordan, Mauritius, Cyprus, Brazil,
Venezuela, China, Algeria, Nepal, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Armenia,
Vietnam, Australia, Hungary, France, USA, Maldives, Mongolia, Zambia, Armenia,
Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia. These visits led to an increased and balanced coverage
of India in foreign media as well as also to a better overall understanding of the
country, this Ministry provided assistance to these journalists and facilitated their
visit through logistics and liaison support.
Foreign media accompanying Heads of State or Government on visits to India
were also facilitated in terms of accreditation, access, media coverage, arranging
press briefings and providing all logistical arrangements. The country received VVIPs
from Algeria, Mauritius, Greece, Lithuania, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Morocco, United
Nations (Secretary General), Czech Republic, Norway, Russia, Tajikistan, Pakistan,
Bhutan, Palestine, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Thailand and China. VIP visits
from Bhutan, Panama, Spain, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Russia, China, Croatia,
Thailand, Palestine, USA, Japan, France, Commonwealth (Secretary General) and
Canada were also facilitated on media matters. Several key representatives of the
new interim regime in Afghanistan also visited India.
Similarly, this Ministry continued to also handle all logistical arrangements for
Indian media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and Prime Minister
on their visits abroad, including to Vietnam, Mauritius, Iran, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Cambodia, Russia, USA, UK and Japan. External Publicity Division effectively
contributed during these visits by way of setting up and operating media centres
110

and looking after all logistical arrangements for the Indian media - locally based and
traveling with the VVIPs. Minister of External Affairss visits to Syria, Egypt, USA,
UK, Australia, Russia, Myanmar, France, Germany and Afghanistan were also
facilitated. Besides, assistance was also provided to Indian journalists going abroad
on specific assignments as on the goodwill visit to Iraq, and to the media covering
the war in Afghanistan.
Over 300 foreign journalists of various foreign news agencies and organizations
are serving as resident correspondents in India. An important aspect of external
publicity work has been to provide accreditation facilities and other clearances for
renewal of visas etc. to these journalists. With growing international media interest
in India, as evidenced by the increased number of bureaus, work related to facilitation
and process has been steadily increasing.
Audio-visual publicity was an important aspect of work relating to external
publicity, involving the production of documentary films and purchase of audiovisual material for dissemination abroad.
During the year the Ministry undertook the production of several documentaries.
These include films on the Indian diaspora in UK, Mauritius and East Africa, Indias
strides forward in information technology, the Indian Navy, Indias civilizational
heritage and linkages with South East Asia, Indian democracy, Indias relations with
South Africa, Bangladesh, UN and Europe.
In an unprecedented exercise, films were dubbed into various foreign languages
for wider and more effective publicity. Most of the films were telecast on foreign TV
channels on the occasion of Indias Independence and Republic Day celebrations
and on special Indian film weeks and festivals.
Special screenings of documentary films, Steps & Strides, Indian Legends and
Rasamanjari (films commissioned by MEA) were organized for the resident
diplomatic community, foreign and Indian media and eminent persons from the
world of art and cinema.
Rasikapriya, a film produced by MEA received the best documentary film,
best direction and best editing awards at the 48th National Films Awards held in
New Delhi on 12 December 2001. The award was received by the Spokesperson &
Joint Secretary (XP) on behalf of the Ministry.

Annual Report 2001-2002
Nineteen Indian feature film festivals/ film weeks were organized by various
missions/ posts abroad namely, Thimpu, Brasilia, Saint Denis, Madrid, Caracas, Minsk,
Buenos Aires, Budapest, Sofia, Nairobi, Baku, Damascus, Bratislava, Cairo, Hanoi,
Moscow, Chicago, Dakar, and Berlin for which films were supplied by the Ministry.
Special Retrospectives of Raj Kapoor and Guru Dutt films were organized by the
Consulate General of India in Chicago.
Several Hindi feature films in Betacam format were acquired for telecast in
Hungary, Egypt and Vietnam.Twenty three Indian films were procured for embassies
in the Arab world for wide dissemination, given the popularity of Indian cinema in
that region. A large number of films were purchased for gifting to Afghan TV in view
of the popular demand for these films among the people of Afghanistan.
As a follow-up to the visit of Prime Minister to Mauritius, a 7.2 m C-Band Earth
Station Antenna was gifted to the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation.
Audio-visual material, including CD-RoMs on subjects like Indian wildlife, Indian
history, music etc and audio and video CDs and audio cassettes of Indian classical
film music were distributed to the Indian posts/missions abroad for the audio-visual
libraries and for presentation purposes. A CD-RoM titled India: Timeless Civilisation
 a Vibrant Democracy produced by MEA and dubbed in various foreign languages
was also distributed to missions/posts abroad for presentation purposes.

Photographs and bio-profiles of President, Vice-President, Prime Minister and
Minister of External Affairs were sent to various Missions. A set of 50 photographs
on the life of Mahatma Gandhi were sent to High Commission of India, Canberra &
High Commission of India, Mahe for organising a Photo Exhibition on the occasion
of Gandhi Jayanti. A Photo Exhibition of the Bamiyan Buddhas and Albums on
Buddhist Themes in Gandhara Art was prepared for presentation to the Maha Bodhi
Sabha of Sri Lanka by Indian Mission in Colombo. A select bunch of film posters and
stills have been mounted for the purpose of organising exhibitions on the 100 years
of Indian Cinema. Photo exhibitions on India were specially prepared for key Missions
in Europe, Asia & Africa.
The circulation of India Perspectives, the flagship magazine of the Ministry,
remained steady at more than fifty five thousand copies in ten international languages
during the year. The magazine was distributed through Indian Missions and Posts
abroad every month. Although Indias rich historical and cultural heritage forms
the backdrop of the magazine, it is primarily focused on the rapid and giant strides
being made by the country in the fields of science, technology and core sectors of
the economy. The magazine also carried articles on the impact that ancient Indian
civilization has had on various world civilizations, notably in Central Asia and Europe.
The articles, encompassing all facets of life in India, were illustrated by impressive
and aesthetic visuals.

Passport, Visas and Consular Services

6

he Passport, Visa and Consular Division of the Ministry of External Affairs
serves Indian and foreign nationals directly by issuing passports to the Indian
nationals and by overseeing the issue of visas to foreign visitors and provision
of consular services to Indian nationals by the Indian Missions and Posts abroad. In
this rapidly globalising world, the frequency of foreign travel as well as the segment
of the popular crossing the international borders has increased. With a vast reservoir
of trained manpower,Indian nationals have been creating opportunities for
themselves abroad for studies, employment and business. The possession of a
passport is a pre-requisite for the individual to legally leave the shores of his country.

Passport Services
During the year, the Central Passport Organisation moved rapidly on the course
of modernisation, computerisation and decentralisation. The guiding principles were
to meet the expectations of the passport applicants and streamline the working of
the Passport Offices. Efforts continued to improve the services through various new
measures for providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport
Offices and 22 Passport Application Collection Centres. Two new Passport Application
Collection Centres were opened at Gulbarga and Kargil. The newly introduced system
of printing, distribution and sale at a nominal price of passport application forms
was further strengthened and has proved to be a success.
Passport Offices at Bhopal, Bareilly, Goa, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Thane, Pune,
Cochin, Jalandhar, Kozhikode launched their websites during the year which carry
118

all the rules, regulations etc. for passport, visa and PIO Cards and carry information
about the status of application submitted at that particular Passport Office.
Annual Passport Officers Conference was held from 28 April to 1 May 2001 in
Hyderabad at which fresh ideas for reforming and revamping the procedures were
discussed to make the system both user-friendly and efficient. There was special
emphasis on the redressal of public grievances and the practice of periodical Passport
Adalats was continued at most Passport Offices.

Decentralisation through Post Offices and District Offices
To decentralise the passport services and to bring these services closer to the
people, it is envisioned that the passport applicants should be able to deposit their
filled passport application forms through a wide network of offices going down to
the District/Sub-divisional level. The channels envisaged were the Speedpost Centres
of the Deptt. of Posts and the SP/DMs office in each District. The Speedpost Passport
services were launched on 5 March 2001. The facility is now available in 31 cities
under the jurisdiction of 11 passport offices viz. Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkata,
Chennai, Cochin, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kozhikode, Mumbai, Chandigarh and
Thiruvananthapuram.

District Passport Cells
The government decided to accept passport applications through a designated
office (DM or SP) in each district of the country. The designated offices would function

Annual Report 2001-2002
as the District Passport Cells. Meetings have been held with representatives of all
State Governments to operationalise this proposal.

Ongoing Innovations
The Tatkaal Scheme for out-of-turn issue of passports launched has been very
successful. It has enabled the system to speedily respond to public demand and has
also generated substantial additional revenue for the Government.

Review of Passport Issue System
In March 2001, an Inter-Ministerial Committee had been established in the
Cabinet Secretariat to review the present system for issue of passports. The Committee
submitted its Report in September 2001 and made important recommendations
endorsing the roadmap for the Ministry for decentralisation, computerisation and
streamlining of the work of the Passport Offices. The Committee made important
recommendations for simplifying the police verification procedures. The Report has
been, in principle, accepted by the Ministry and the Minister of State held a meeting
with the Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police of all the States on 23
November 2001 for the expeditious implementation of the Report.
The genuine need of passport applicants for assistance in filling up a passport
application form has been recognised. Associations of ex-servicemen had been
approached to open facilitation counters at some Passport Offices where they would
assist the applicants on the payment of a small fee. Such counters have already
started functioning at the Passport Offices in Jalandhar, Tiruchirapalli, Bangalore,
New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Trivandrum and Cochin.
The old Passport Manual (1983) was thoroughly revised and updated and the
new Manual (2000) has been released.
The rules for issue of duplicate passports in case of loss or damage as well as reissue of passports after expiry of ten-year validity were simplified. Passports can
now be issued in such cases on post-police verification basis.

Infrastructure
At most Passport Offices, concrete measures were taken to provide more
amenities for the applicants/visitors. The new Passport Office building at Hyderabad

was inaugurated on 30 April 2001. Additional space was provided to Passport Office,
Mumbai to relieve congestion.
The Government has taken up construction of buildings to house the Passport
Offices at Bangalore, Kolkata, Cochin, Kozhikode and Panaji. At present, Passport
Office buildings at five places (Mumbai, Cochin, Kozhikode, Ahmedabad and
Hyderabad) are owned by MEA, at six places are owned by the Central Government/
State Government and are rented in 17 places. MEA acquired plots of land/built-up
properties in various cities in India and construction or design work was in progress
at eight places viz. Bangalore, Kolkata, Cochin (residential complex), Jaipur, Lucknow
Patna, Panaji and Chandigarh (office complex). The process for purchase of land at
three other places i.e. Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirapalli and Jammu was also in
progress.

Computerisation
At present, 27 of the 28 Passport Offices have been computerised. Patna, is the
only Passport Office still to be computerised. Computerisation of Passport Office
Patna will be taken up as soon as the Passport Office shifts to its own newly
constructed building.
E-mail facility was available at all computerised Passport Offices. Tele-enquiry
system was in operation at all the computerised Passport Offices except Pune and
Bhopal for which a software upgradation is underway. Websites were established at
Bangalore, Chennai, Chandigarh, Bhopal and Lucknow in 2001 bringing the total
number of passport offices having websites to 14. A proposal for a comprehensive
computerised network and connectivity as well as creation of a Central Processing
Cell was under implementation.

Volume of Passport Applications
Upto September 2001, there was an unprecedented 15 per cent increase in the
number of applications received during the corresponding period in the year 2000
for grant of passports. Demand for other miscellaneous services like renewal, change
of name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. was also high. However,
there was a perceptible fall in the number of passport applicants in the last quarter
of the year. A total number of 22,71,853 passports were issued and 2,47,809
119

Passport, Visas and Consular Services

miscellaneous services were rendered (upto 31 October 2001) during the year 2001.
Detailed figures of receipts of passports issued/services rendered, including the
revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices, are at Annexure-IV

Machine Writing of Passports
Machine writing of passports had initially been introduced at RPO Delhi. RPO
Delhi has now taken up machine writing of passports of PO Ghaziabad also. Machine
writing is also being introduced in other major passport offices. It has already started
functioning at Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chandigarh in the month of November, 2001
and is likely to be started very soon in RPO Ahmedabad and Kozhikode.

Cadre Review
The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) are running the 28
Passport Offices and 22 existing Passport Application Collection Centres. The current
strength of CPO cadre (after the Cadre Review in 2001) is 2076 with 213 officers and
1869 non-gazetted staff. One of the major demands of the employees has been for a
comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at various levels. This has been
largely addressed in the Cadre Review of the CPO which was undertaken by the Staff
Inspection Unit. Approval of the Ministry of Finance was received for creation/
abolition of the following posts:

Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad strive to fully meet the consular needs of Overseas
Indians and are geared to provide efficient and timely assistance on all days and at
all hours. Assistance to Non-Resident Indians/workers, especially in the Gulf countries,
including on disputes with their employers/sponsors, is being provided through the
Labour Wings in the Missions and Posts. Government maintained contacts with the
Governments of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism
of the Joint Commissions, with the objective of resolving consular problems and
ameliorating the conditions of Indian workers in those countries. In cases of deaths
of Indians abroad, prompt assistance was provided by Indian Missions and Posts for
completing the formalities for early despatch of the mortal remains, liaison with
the local and Indian authorities and keeping the relatives of the deceased informed.

was held in New Delhi on 8 & 9 October 2001. The Conference was inaugurated by
Minister of Labour, Shri Sharad Yadav, in the presence of Minister of State for External
Affairs, Shri Omar Abdullah, and it provided an opportunity to the Welfare Officers
of Indian Missions/Posts in Gulf countries to interact with senior officers of the
Ministries of External Affairs and Labour, Intelligence Bureau, Protectors of Emigrants
and representatives of various State Governments. Existing procedure with regard
to recruitment of workers for jobs in Gulf countries, emigration clearance, problems
faced by Indian workers, welfare measures and computerisation were the main issues
discussed during the Conference.

Visas
Over the years, the procedure for grant of visa by Indian Missions and Posts has

Annual Report 2001-2002
been liberalised. Many Missions and Posts grant visas either across the counter or
the same day and most others issue visas within 48 hours.
A project for computerisation of the Consular Wings of the Missions and Posts
in the Gulf, West Europe and North America is under implementation. First, those
Missions and Posts would be computerised where the volume of services rendered
is high. Separately, NIC has been working on the computerisation of the consular
wings of HCI, Dhaka and Colombo.
Indias 152 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to 10,83,653
foreigners during the period from 1 January 2001 to 30 September 2001.

Consular Attestation
During the year 3,32,241 documents were accorded Consular attestation in CPV
Division, of which 18,345 were commercial documents. This service is rendered on
the same day without any charges and is prompt and efficient.

Bilateral Agreements
In order to provide a legal and institutional framework to combat organized
crime, international terrorism and drug trafficking, and to respond to the growing
international dimensions of financial and other crime, bilateral agreements are being
negotiated with several countries to provide legal under-pinning to this international
effort. These consular agreements include Extradition Treaties, Agreements on Mutual
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Legal Assistance in Civil Matters and Consular
Conventions.
Extradition Treaties with Germany and Turkey were signed in the month of
June, 2001 during Home Ministers visits to these countries. Agreements on Mutual
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters with Tajikistan and USA were signed in New
Delhi in May 2001 and October 2001 respectively. Extradition Treaties were initialled
at official level with Malaysia and Spain in May 2001 and June 2001 respectively.
During the year, official delegations visited Malaysia, Italy and Spain to negotiate
Extradition Treaties and Agreement on Mutual legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.
Agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil Matters were proposed to Bulgaria
and Iraq.

The Ministry actively pursues requests for extradition and other legal assistance
from foreign Governments both for criminal and civil/commercial offences. The
requests for extradition emanate from Indian obligations under the Extradition
Treaties or Extradition Arrangements entered into with various countries. During
the year 14 requests for extradition and 74 requests for legal assistance were received
in addition to the ongoing cases.

Assistance provided in the aftermath of 11 September
In the aftermath of terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11
September 2001, Government of India provided every possible assistance in tracing
missing Indians (NRIs/PIOs) by operating 24 hour help-lines at CGI, New York and
Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi, and liaised closely with the New York city
authorities. The help-line of the Ministry handled 373 enquiries from anxious
relatives/friends from all over India and helped in ascertaining safety of 110 persons.
There was no report of any loss of life or serious injury to any Indian (NRI/PIO)
in Washington. 107 persons of Indian origin were registered with the New York City
Authorities as missing and presumed dead as a result of the attacks on the World
Trade Centre, New York. No list of Indians killed in the attacks is available, since
most of them are classified as missing. Most of these persons worked as professionals
in the corporate sector and financial companies. The Ministry had made arrangements
with Air India, Indian Airlines and Indian Railways for free transportation of mortal
remains of the victims of these attacks from New York to their destinations in India.

Vision
The public interface with the Ministry of External Affairs is through the Consular,
Passport and Visa work. The public rightly expects prompt and courteous service
with minimal delays. The mission of the Ministry is to expand the network of contact
points from where services can be delivered, go in for massive computerisation 
both for processing and storage of data and to achieving a level of applicant
satisfaction of which it can be proud.

The module on Security and Nuclear Matters apart from focussing on vital
security issues like nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control, also
covered Indias defence policy, the state of the armed forces, developments in defence
technology and the security of the border areas.

From this year, the Bimal Sanyal Memorial Prize for the best all-round
probationer was instituted and awarded.

The module on Special Diplomatic Skills emphasised negotiating skills,
communications skills, use of Information Technology, development of leadership
skills and espirit de corps. Mock sessions on negotiation skills were held. A special
module on International Law & Diplomacy was arranged for the 2000 batch to
understand the application of international law in diplomatic negotiations.
Apart from these modules, there was a good deal of emphasis on field visits to
acquaint the probationers with the ground situation in sensitive areas of the country
such as the North-East, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. The probationers
were also attached with the various wings of armed forces for orientation and
briefing.
The Indian Foreign Service probationers were also given extensive briefing on
the role of Management in Diplomacy at the Tata Management Training Centre,
Pune.
Continuing with the programme of visiting neighbouring countries, Indian
Foreign Service Probationers visited Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bangladesh for a
period of around one week each.
The Institute also organised brief Orientation Programmes for officers from other
Ministries of Government of India proceeding on posting to our Missions abroad.

foreign diplomats was arranged. The programme was designed to impart basic
information about India to newly arrived diplomats and covered topics such as the
Constitution of India; organisation of MEA & Government of India; Indias economic
policy; historical legacy of India; Indian art, music & culture, etc.

Academies and other similar institutions of other countries. FSI already has signed
MoUs with Peru, Brazil, Russia, Uruguay, Vietnam, Croatia, Sudan, Chile, Guyana,

As part of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Diplomatic Academy
of Peru and the Foreign Service Institute, the Peruvian Embassy in Delhi awarded a
prize for the probationer who wrote the best monograph.
The Professional Course for Foreign Diplomats (PCFD) is a six-week prestigious
course organized by the FSI. It was started in 1992 following a directive from the
Prime Minister. The course is held 3 times a year and 24-26 foreign diplomats
participate in each such programme. 28 PCFDs have been held so far and more than
600 diplomats from over 110 countries across the world have participated in them.
The Course aims at providing a fresh perspective and an exposure to the latest
developments in the major fields of activities which are of professional interest to a
practicing diplomat. Areas related to diplomacy, international relations, international
law and international organizations, security and diplomatic practice are covered in
the course. The course also aims at familiarizing the visiting foreign diplomats with
various aspects of Indias polity, its history and culture, salient features of its foreign
and security policy as well as its achievements and capabilities in the fields of
economy, science and technology. One of the major highlights of the course is the
study tour of the participants to various centres of economic, industrial and cultural
importance to give them a first hand feel of Indias rich heritage and of various
facets of Indias national development.
The PCFD programme underwent a comprehensive revision this year. Until
recently, the course was held under the aegis of the ITEC/SCAAP scheme but has
since been de-linked and is now open to non-ITEC/SCAAP countries as well. With
effect from this year the Foreign Service Institute offers participation in the PCFDs
on the basis of a system of gradation of countries based on their per capita incomes.
For Category I countries, the terms of participation remains as in the past viz. the
expenditure is borne by the GOI. Countries belonging to Category II bear the
international travel passage for their nominee while the GOI bears the local
expenditure. The nominee of the Category III countries are admitted against the
payment of Course Fee (presently set at US $ 4,000/-) which is estimated to cover the
127

Foreign Service Institute
local expenditure. In addition, the Category III countries also bear the international
airfare of their nominee. For the first time, diplomats from Australia and Kuwait
participated in the 28th PCFD under the new scheme.

Next level courses on MS Access and on specialized application software packages
are being prepared in consultation with the IT Task Force of the Ministry and will be
offered in due course.

The 28th PCFD was held from October 4 -November 9, 2001 in which 24 diplomats
participated. 23 diplomats participated in the 29th PCFD which was held from
10 January to 15 February 2002. The 30th PCFD is scheduled to be organised from
4 March to 12 April 2002.

The Basic Professional Course is a mandatory Refresher Course for officials in
the Ministry of External Affairs upto the level of Section Officers prior to their
departure on posting to Indian Missions abroad. Emphasis is given in this Course on
preparing officials to function effectively as a team in the diplomatic environment
abroad, besides an exposure to administrative rules and procedures, finance and
accounts work relevant to Indian Missions and passport, visas and consular work.
The effort is to co-relate closely with the expected job profile of each participant
while providing an overall perspective of the functions of each wing in our Missions
abroad. The Course also includes modules on cultural, commercial, information and
education work in the Mission. As our Missions provide the first impression of the
country and the Institute has, therefore, endeavoured to instill a high level of polite,
positive and courteous behaviour among the members of the Mission. Nine BPC
courses were held this year in which over 300 officials of the Ministry participated.

In addition, the FSI is also organizing a special three-month training course for
20 Afghan diplomats from 18 February 2002. The programme aims at building
professional skills required in diplomatic assignments and includes several training
modules on language and computer proficiency, various aspects of diplomacy, foreign
policy, international relations, topical global issues and economic diplomacy.

India and her cultural heritage. These centres conduct regular classes of Indian music,
dance, yoga etc. The cultural centres in Moscow and Paramaribo also teach Hindi.
The Centres also maintain audiovisual and print libraries for visitors and provide a
supportive role to the respective Indian Missions for coordinating cultural activities.

Indian Council of World Affairs

T

he Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA) was founded in 1943 with a view to
encourage in the country the study of Indian and international affairs. It is a
prestigious centre for the study of international relations and foreign affairs.
Its building, Sapru House, was completed in 1955 and named after its first President,
Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. The Council serves the public in general and the intellectual
community in particular by providing through its publications, lectures, and a
specialised library, valuable information for basic understanding of the complexities
of the international system. It was the ICWA which convened the first Asian Relations
Conference in 1947, followed by Indian-American Conference and a series of
international conference abroad. In 1956, the ICWA acquired consultative status
with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The major activities of
the Council are research, publication, organisation of and participation in conferences,
seminars, and symposia and maintenance of the library.
The ICWA ran very well for the first 38 years of its existence. However, matters
started deteriorating from 1981. The membership was enlarged to include unlettered
persons with a view to providing an electoral base for perpetuating control of the
management. Certain provisions of the Memorandum of Association were altered to
increase the tenure of the elected members from three to six years. Numerous
complaints about its functioning had been received from academicians, scholars
and staff members while articles and editorials criticising its functioning had appeared
in the national media.

In order to arrest the decline of the ICWA, the Government of India promulgated
the Indian Council of World Affairs Ordinance No. 3 of 2000 on 1 September 2000 on
the basis of which the ICWA was declared an institution of national importance and
converted into a statutory body corporate.
The ICWA bill 2001 was introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha on 23 August
2001. It was subsequently introduced in the Rajya Sabha and passed with
amendments on 29 August 2001. The President of India gave his assent to the ICWA
Act, 2001 (No. 29 of 2001) on 3 September 2001. It was made effective from 1
September 2000.

Sapru House Building
The newly formed body corporate set up under the Ordinance started functioning
from Sapru House on 2 September 2000. Owing to previous neglect and inaction,
the physical deterioration of the Sapru House premises was alarming. Major civil
and electrical repairs were undertaken immediately by the new Council. The
Committee room, Conference room, Library and the auditorium have been fully
renovated and made functional. Gardens, pathways and boundary walls, too, have
been restored and repaired. Sapru House has been restored to the status appropriate
for housing an institution of national importance.

Grant-in-Aid
ICWAs grant-in-aid for the year 2001-2002 for both recurring and non-recurring
135

Indian Council of World Affairs

expenditure was Rs. One crore. It has projected for additional funds of Rs.20 lakhs in
the Revised Estimates for the year 2001-2002 for civil and electrical works and also
for revival of the activities of the Council.

Publications
The Council has a significant publication programme. It brings out two journals
 India Quarterly and ICWA  Foreign Affairs Reports on a regular basis. It also
produces special publications. Notable among the latter were : 1) Joint publication
with IDSA State Sovereignty in the 21st Century : Concept, Relevance and Limits,
(2) Special Commemorative volume  The First Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru Lecture on
Reflections : 11 September 2001 and After delivered by Shri Jaswant Singh, Minister
of External Affairs, (3) Publication dealing with Devolution Discourse in Sri Lanka
under preparation by Director ICSSR, Dr. Partha S. Ghosh.
The Council proposes to award Research Fellowships from the financial year
2002-2003.

Agreements with Similar Institutions
The Council intends to sign agreements or memorandum of understanding (MoU)
with similar institutions abroad to fulfil its aims and objectives. Recently, it signed a
MoU with the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in the Russian
Federation during the Prime Ministers visit to Moscow in the month of October
2001.

Track II Diplomacy
I.C.W.A. has also been earmarked as a nodal point for Track-II diplomacy. TrackII diplomacy would henceforth be taken up through facilitation of international
contacts among organizations and persons concerned with foreign affairs on matters
of common concern.

Library
The Sapru House library was fully renovated after September 2000. The ICWAs
library has an exceptional collection pertaining to international affairs, including
some rare books as well. Owing to the moribund state of the institution during the
136

past 20 years, no significant additions were made to the Library. During the year,
508 new titles were added to the collection by the Library Committee. The library
received 382 Indian and international research journals and dailies. Indexation of
journals provided bibliographical support to users. A monthly abstract of current
articles available in the ICWA library is published in its journal Foreign Affairs
Report.
The Library is a depository of documents of the United Nations and its Specialised
Agencies. It has almost all UN documents from 1945 onwards. It also receives the
European Unions publications. More than 33,000 press clippings were culled from
major national dailies for the clipping service. These were added subject - wise to
the existing collection of more than 2.5 million press clippings dating back to the
1950s.
More than 6,200 visitors used the library in 2001. 51 research scholars from
various universities have used the library material for their research. Among these
universities were the following : Aligarh Muslim University, Andhra University, Delhi
University, Guru Nanak Dev University Amritsar, Jammu University, Jawarharlal Nehru
University and Sri Venkateswara University.

Seminars/Symposia/Conferences
The ICWA conducted a number of Seminars/Symposia/Conferences during the
period under report. A complete list is at Annexure-XXIII.

Introduction and Synopsis

,

uring 2001-02, Governments foreign policy initiatives adhered to Indias
well-established objective of striving for a stable and peaceful
international environment, especially in our immediate neighbourhood,
so as to enable the nation to concentrate its energies on the declared goal of
rapid domestic economic growth and social development. The year witnessed
a series of extraordinary events and happenings that were as momentous as
they were defining. They naturally impacted on our foreign policy options and
called for swift, calculated and carefully calibrated responses. Government faced
these challenges adroitly while establishing new milestones in the conduct of
its diplomacy.

international community that the phenomenon of terrorism must be tackled
globally, and in a non-selective manner, for which close international cooperation
is a basic requirement. This recognition found reflection in the unanimous
adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1373. There is also a widespread
international consensus today, that there is no justification for terrorism which
must be eradicated wherever it exists. While India cooperated closely with key
bilateral partners in the global campaign against terrorism, at home cross-border
terrorism was resolutely confronted and there was growing realization, as stated
by Prime Minister, that Indias fight against terrorism had entered a decisive
phase.

The terrorist attack of September 11 changed the manner in which the
world viewed the phenomenon of terrorism. With the rest of the world, India
also strongly condemned these terrorist attacks and called for a global campaign
against terrorism that was sustained and included steps against terrorist groups
and their state sponsors. The terrorist attacks against the Jammu & Kashmir
State Assembly on October 1 and Indias Parliament building on December 13
by two Pakistan based terrorist groups further underscored the fact to the
international community that terrorism poses a particularly serious danger to
liberal and democratic societies. There is now a widespread awareness in the

Indias intensified engagement with the international community was
evidenced in the large number of high-level dignitaries who visited Delhi
including the Chairman of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan the
German Chancellor, the Presidents of Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Pakistan and
Tajikistan and the Prime Ministers of China, Norway, Thailand, and the United
Kingdom. Prime Minister visited Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, UK and
USA. These visits aided the process of high-level consultations between India
and the countries concerned and ensured that our views found echo in the
councils of the world.

Introduction and Synopsis

The broad framework of priorities within which Indias foreign policy is
crafted can be summarized as follows:
r

To protect and safeguard Indias sovereignty and territorial integrity while
preserving autonomy in decision-making and simultaneously enhancing
the countrys strategic space.

r

To promote Indias role as a factor for peace, stability, security and balance
in the international arena.

r

To win international understanding and support for Indias national
interests, priorities, aspirations and concerns within the rapidly changing
international environment.

r

To strengthen peace and stability in our region, defined in the widest
possible sense, and enhance friendship, cooperation and mutually beneficial
inter-dependencies with the countries in our extended neighbourhood.

r

To work with the P-5 countries and other major powers in strengthening
peace, security and multi-polarity in the world based on the new architecture
of dialogue and cooperation.

r

To promote the cause of democracy and individual freedom so as to unleash
the creative genius of peoples all over the world and promote greater
realization that democratic governance and systems are essential
ingredients of international peace and stability.

r

To work constructively with other countries in multilateral institutions
and international organizations such as the UN, NAM, ARF, IOR-ARC, etc.,
so as to generate internationally accepted approaches to contemporary
challenges.

r

EE
142

To give greater focus and priority to economic diplomacy with the objective
of increasing Indias foreign trade and investments into India, ensuring
equitable transfer of technology and managerial know-how and
strengthening our general economic and commercial links with the rest of
the world.

Strengthening relations with our immediate neighbours continued to
remain a priority focus area for Government. In keeping with this approach,
Prime Minister participated in the 11th SAARC Summit held at Kathmandu
between 4-6 January 2002. The Kathmandu Declaration issued at the conclusion
of the Summit outlines the three main thrust areas for the South Asian region,
viz., the economic agenda, poverty alleviation and elimination of terrorism.
The Summit decided that efforts be made to finalise the text of a draft treaty for
establishing a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by end-2002. On Prime
Ministers initiative, the Summit agreed to reconvene the South Asian
Independent Commission on Poverty Alleviation. Two Conventions were signed,
(a) the Convention on Preventing and Combating the Trafficking in Women and
Children for Prostitution and (b) the Convention on Regional Arrangements for
Promotion of Child Welfare in South Asia.
Indias relations with Nepal continue to be marked by cordiality and
cooperation buttressed by a solid corpus of multilevel contacts. Following the
tragedy which struck the royal family of Nepal, the Minister for External Affairs,
Shri Jaswant Singh, visited Nepal to personally convey to His Majesty King
Gyanendra the deepest condolences of the Government and people of India.
Functional bilateral mechanisms maintained their vigour with meetings being
held of groups relating to the boundary, border management and bilateral
projects relating to Pancheshwar, Sapta Kosi and Sun Kosi. The bilateral trade
Treaty between the two countries was extended for another five years till March
2007. India supported the efforts of the Government of Nepal to maintain order
and tranquility against violence by Maoist groups.
India regards Bhutan as one of its closest friends. Bhutans development
efforts continue to receive major contributions from India. In the Eighth Five
Year Plan, the Government of India rendered assistance worth Rs. 900 crores.
Considerable progress was recorded in the Indian-assisted Kuricho and Tala
Hydroelectric projects. There was a regular momentum of high level visits
including that of the Crown Prince of Bhutan Dasho Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck
from 20-31 August 2001. There was close liaison between the two Governments

Annual Report 2001-2002

on the presence of Ulfa and Bodo extremists in Southern Bhutan. The Royal
Government of Bhutan have reiterated their opposition to Bhutanese territory
being misused against Indian interests.
Relations with Sri Lanka continued to be close and cooperative with
conscious efforts to strengthen bilateral initiatives in diverse fields. In a gesture,
both symbolic and substantive, the newly-elected Sri Lankan Prime Minister,
Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, made India the destination of his first foreign visit.
India reiterated its commitment to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Sri Lanka. India supported the Peace Process amplifying that a negotiated
settlement should meet the aspirations of all elements of Sri Lankan society.
Exchanges with Bangladesh continued across a broad front. The grave and
unprovoked incidents of violence against Indian personnel manning the IndoBangladesh border in April 2001 were an aberration whose adverse impact on
relations was contained by the common will of the two Governments. Principal
Secretary to the Prime Minister and National Security Adviser visited Bangladesh
as PMs Special Envoy immediately after the election of the Begum Zia
government in Dhaka exhibiting Indias willingness to work constructively with
the new government of Bangladesh. The Protocol Agreement to operate a
passenger bus service between Agartala and Dhaka and an Agreement to
facilitate running of passenger train services between India and Bangladesh
were signed. The Bilateral Trade Agreement was extended for a further period
of six months. During the visit to India of the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary in
February 2002, Bangladesh promised that its territory would not be permitted
to be utilized for activities against any country including India.
The traditionally close relations with the Maldives were sustained through
regular and cordial interaction at high levels with Prime Minister meeting
President Gayoom during the SAARC Summit at Kathmandu in January 2002.
Indian assistance to infrastructure construction, population consolidation
projects, education and governance related activities and other development
needs of the Maldives remained sustained.

India and Myanmar imparted enhanced substance to bilateral cooperation
exemplified by the MOU signed on 25 May 2001 concerning the maintenance of
the Tamu-Kalemyo-Kalewa Road. Multimodal transport projects concerning
upgradation of Sittwe port, navigation on the river Kaladan, and highway
development from Kaletwa to the India-Myanmar border in Mizoram were other
areas of cooperation. Energy related projects including solar, fossil fuel and
hydroelectric energy remained items of great promise for future cooperation.
Dialogue on security-related issues between military and civilian agencies of
both sides continued. The trend of high-level contacts between the countries at
both political and official levels was continued.
India continued its endeavors to establish peaceful, friendly and cooperative
ties with Pakistan as envisaged in the Simla Agreement and the Lahore
Declaration. Prime Minister extended an invitation to President Pervez Musharraf
to visit India for summit level talks. Prime Ministers initiative, for dialogue
and peace, was widely acclaimed both domestically and internationally. Summit
level talks were held from 14-16 July 2001 in New Delhi and Agra. During the
discussions, Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, emphasized the
importance of creating an atmosphere of trust and confidence for progress on
outstanding issues including Jammu & Kashmir. He also took up specific issues
that would contribute to the process of peace including the issue of 54 Indian
PoWs, the extradition of terrorists who have sought refuge in Pakistan, the
upkeep of religious shrines, treatment of religious pilgrims, and trade related
issues. Pakistans President, however, focused almost exclusively on the issue
of Jammu & Kashmir. The Indian side worked very hard to bridge the vast
differences in our respective approaches to bilateral relations, and to arrive at a
draft joint document that would move our bilateral relations forward. Eventually,
this quest had to be abandoned because of Pakistans insistence on the
settlement of the Jammu & Kashmir issue as a precondition to normalizing
relations. Pakistan was also unwilling to address our concerns on cross border
terrorism.

Introduction and Synopsis

The December 13 attack against Indias Parliament building by two Pakistan
based terrorist groups, the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and the Jaish-e-Mohammed, was
undoubtedly the most audacious and alarming act of terrorism in the two decade
long history of Pakistan sponsored cross border terrorism in India. In view of
the clear evidence of Pakistans continued sponsorship of cross border terrorism,
India announced on 21st December the recall of its High Commissioner from
Islamabad, and the termination of the Delhi Lahore Bus service and the
Samjhauta Express. On 27th December further measures were announced
including a reduction in the strengths of the respective High Commissions by
50%; a restriction on the movement of officials of the Pakistan High Commission
in New Delhi; and a suspension of over flight facilities to Pakistan and Pakistan
Airlines. On 31st December, India also handed over to Pakistan a list of 20 fugitives
from law, and asked that they be apprehended and handed over so that they
could be brought to justice for the crimes committed in the country.
On 12 January 2002, in an address to the Pakistan nation, the President of
Pakistan stated that henceforth Pakistan would not allow its territory to be
used for terrorism anywhere in the world. Three weeks later, on 5th February
2002, in another public address the President of Pakistan made it amply clear
that Pakistans real approach to cross border terrorism remained unchanged. In
this February 5 address the President of Pakistan reiterated Pakistans timeworn and untenable formulations on terrorism and sought to justify the
continued terrorist violence in Jammu & Kashmir. India rejects this outright.
The widespread international consensus today is that there is no justification
for terrorism, which must be eradicated wherever it exists. India is determined
to take all necessary steps to preserve its security and territorial integrity, and
will resist terrorism until it is decisively crushed.
The military-political situation in Afghanistan underwent a drastic change
with the eviction of the Taliban from Afghan territory, following the international
campaign against the forces of terrorism. The Bonn Agreement signaled the
onset of new political processes in Afghanistan. The Government of India reestablished its diplomatic presence in Afghanistan with the opening of the

EL
144

Liaison Office of the Ministry of External Affairs in Kabul on 21 November 2001.
The Liaison Office was converted into our Embassy on 22nd December, 2001.
The bilateral political interaction between India and Afghanistan witnessed
intensive exchanges. Several ministers in the Afghan Interim Administration,
including Foreign Minister, Interior Minister, Minister of Light Industries and
Vice Chairman and Minister of Planning in the Afghan Interim Administration
visited India between December 2001 - February 2002. The Chairman of the
Afghan Interim Administration H.E. Hamid Karzai, paid a state visit to India on
26-27 February 2002. During Chairman Karzais visit, both sides agreed to
cooperate in the field of health, education, information technology, industry,
public transport and training.
As indication of Indias resolve to further strengthen its bilateral ties with
Afghanistan, government offered extensive humanitarian relief to the Afghan
Interim Administration including through medical relief and personnel.
Government announced its commitment to contribute to reconstruction and
rehabilitation in post conflict Afghanistan. To this end, a line of credit of US$
100 million was offered to the Afghan government for various reconstruction
and rehabilitation projects in Afghanistan. Government also announced grants
of US$ 10 million and US$ 1.5 million for immediate utilization by the Afghan
Interim Administration.
India-Iran relations witnessed new direction and added momentum during
and following the visit to Iran of Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee from
10-13 April 2001. A Joint Statement  the Tehran Declaration  was issued at
the conclusion of the visit and six Agreements/MOUs were signed. The first
ever dialogue on strategic issues was held at Delhi in October 2001 and
discussions on the transfer of Iranian gas to India continued.
Indias relations with China continued to show improvement during the
year. Exchanges at the functional, parliamentary, economic, trade, defence and
non-governmental levels progressed. The visit of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji in January 2002 was an important milestone in bilateral relations and

Annual Report 2001-2002

reflected the importance attached by both countries to the on-going process of
high level political exchanges and to developing mutual trust and confidence.
Both sides agreed to move forward in diverse areas of bilateral relations while
continuing to address differences through dialogue. The process of clarification
and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control along the India-China boundary
is to be accelerated. A bilateral dialogue mechanism against terrorism is to be
established. Six MOUs/Agreements in functional areas were also signed. The
latter reflects the on-going diversification of relations.
Prime Minister Vajpayee paid an official visit to Japan in December 2001.
The visit contributed to adding new dimension and meaningful content to the
Global Partnership in the 21st Century between India and Japan that was agreed
during Prime Minister Moris visit to India in August 2000. A substantive Joint
Declaration was issued at the end of the visit. This focuses on ways and means
of broadening and deepening the development of bilateral relations and meeting
global challenges such as terrorism, etc. Economic sanctions imposed by Japan
on India following our nuclear tests in May 1998 were unilaterally lifted by
Japan in October 2001.
Indias relations with the countries in South-East Asia have traditionally
been close and warm because of a common historical legacy, cultural affinities,
and, of late, economic and commercial interaction. There has been a mutual
recognition of the importance of closer political and economic engagement and
this has imparted a new energy to this relationship. The resilience of the Indian
economy and our strengths in sectors such as HRD, IT and Biotechnology have
helped the ASEAN view India as an attractive economic partner. The recent
consensus agreement of the ASEAN countries to upgrade the level of Indias
interaction with ASEAN to summit level also speaks of this recognition. For
India, despite recent economic difficulties it is facing, South-East Asia is an area
of strong potential growth in the coming decades and it is in our interest to
build a strong framework of commercial, economic and cultural people to people
interchanges with the region. Our mutual interest in closer engagement is

evident from a number of high level visits between the two sides recently. Our
Prime Minister visited Malaysia in May 2001. Thai Prime Minister Dr. Thaksin
Shinawatra visited India in November 2001 and then in February 2002. Our
Vice President paid a visit to Cambodia and Indonesia in June 2001.
Bilateral trade between India and ASEAN came down to US$ 6.96 billion in
2000-01 after reaching a high of US$ 7.35 billion in 1999-2000. However, trade
has shown a new growth in 2001-02. Although two-way investments between
ASEAN and India have not been very high there is a growing recognition of the
potential for joint ventures and strategic alliances in several sectors. ASEAN
recognizes tremendous scope for commercial cooperation in the fields of IT,
Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Space and Human Resource Development etc.
Within the ASEAN, India is committed to engage itself more actively in the
development process of CMLV countries and we have assured them of our
commitment to the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI).
The presence of fundamentalist groups in their own countries with cross
border links has been the cause of recent concern in several countries of the
region. Therefore, it is in our mutual interest to exchange views on international
terrorism between India and ASEAN. While an institutional mechanism for
discussion of security issues has been agreed to with Thailand, similar
mechanisms are being explored with some other member states of ASEAN.
The sub-regional and regional cooperation groupings in South and South
East Asia saw active Indian involvement in pursuance of Indias Look East
policy. At the BIMST-EC Ministerial meeting at Yangon in December 2001, a
comprehensive review of the status of cooperation in the designated sectors
was carried out. The Ministers emphasized the desirability of strengthening
linkages among think tanks of member countries. They also agreed to explore
external financing of BIMST-EC projects under Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC),
a programme of action was drawn up at the Ministerial meeting in Hanoi in
July 2001. It is hoped that the flexible nature of the cooperation agenda, ranging
from culture and tourism to transport and communications, would enable
145L

Introduction and Synopsis

speedy progress. A number of concrete offers of cooperation under both BIMSTEC and MGC were made by India. At the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference
Meeting, India made a number of practical offers of assistance to the newer
ASEAN members (Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam) under the Initiative
for ASEAN Integration (IAI). In conformity with the decision of the last ASEAN
Summit held at Brunei in November 2001, the first ever India-ASEAN Summit
would be held in November 2002 at Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The upcoming
Summit represents a major milestone in Indias growing cooperation with
ASEAN. India coordinated a number of IOR-ARC (Indian Ocean Rim  Association
for Regional Cooperation) projects, and played an active role in the various IORARC programmes and activities.
EAM visited Australia and New Zealand in June 2001, the first dedicated
visit by an Indian Foreign Minister to the region. There were a number of
ministerial visits between India and these two countries during the period under
report. The inaugural meeting of the India-Australia Strategic Dialogue took
place in August 2001.
We have been closely watching the developments in Fiji. We believe that
the power sharing arrangement as enshrined in the 1997 Constitution is best
suited to protect the interests of all sections of multi-ethnic Fijian society. Our
concerns on restoration of constitutional democracy in Fiji have been expressed
at several international fora.
India continued its cordial and friendly relations with South Pacific Island
countries and we provided training facilities and other assistance to these
countries under ITEC Programme.
India and the Central Asian Region have had longstanding exchange of
ideas and culture. With the emergence of the Central Asian Republics
commonalities in philosophies of governance and complementary aspects in
the economy and natural resources enabled relationships to prosper with India.
Both faced threats from religion based fundamentalism, cross border terrorism
and the attendant evil of narcotics. Foreign Office consultations were held with

LE

most of these countries and the majority of them availed of extensive ITEC
assistance during the year.
Countries in the Gulf region, a part of Indias extended neighbourhood, are
a principal source for Indias energy requirements while simultaneously
providing employment to large numbers of Indian expatriate workers. The
region, therefore, is of strategic significance and Government continued to
proactively engage the countries of the region. Indias relations with Saudi Arabia
remained friendly. A team from the National Defence College visited Saudi Arabia
after a gap of 10 years. Arrangements for the Haj were further refined and
improved and record numbers of pilgrims from India performed the Haj
pilgrimage this year. Relations with the United Arab Emirates were greatly
strengthened and consolidated during the year especially in the area of law
enforcement cooperation and mutual legal assistance.
A 75-member goodwill delegation headed by Dr. (Mrs) Najma Heptullah,
Deputy Chairperson, Rajya Sabha which included Shri Digvijay Singh, Minister
of State for Railways, Commerce & Industry visited Iraq in September 2001
thereby underlining our desire to expand our relationship with Iraq while
simultaneously adhering to UN directives.
India continued to pay close attention to developments in West Asia and
North Africa. Support for the Palestinian cause is a cardinal principle of Indias
foreign policy. In Indias view a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the
region can only be established on the basis of relevant UN resolutions and
Principle of Land for Peace and on the basis of two-state solution where a
viable state of Palestine will exist alongside Israel within secure and recognized
borders. India supports the Middle East Peace Process and has welcomed all
milestones crossed by it in the past. All the understandings and accords must
be respected and faithfully implemented without any pre-condition. India is
deeply concerned at the recent escalation of violence in the region which has
led to large number of casualties and injuries to very many innocent people.
There can be no justification for such acts. Need of the hour is restraint to break

Annual Report 2001-2002

this cycle of violence and hatred so that a conducive atmosphere could be created
for an early resumption of negotiations. India strongly feels that nothing should
be done to undermine President Yaser Arafat who embodies the struggle and
aspirations of the Palestinian people. India stands ready to extend all possible
assistance to the friendly people of Palestine.
The level of Indo-US engagement in the first year of the Bush Administration
has been both broad-based and intensive. Since assuming office, President Bush
has repeatedly conveyed his commitment to accelerating the momentum of
recent years in India-U.S. relations and completing the process of qualitatively
transforming the relationship. The two countries further expanded their agenda
of bilateral relations, which is increasingly cast in a global context. The wideranging bilateral Dialogue Architecture, established during the visit of President
Clinton in March 2000, was resumed and expanded. Dialogue on security and
strategic issues have developed beyond non-proliferation issues to cover a wide
range of international concerns and developments. The institutional framework
of defence relations was resumed after a hiatus of three years and the two sides
have drawn up a comprehensive programme of defence and military
cooperation. The United States lifted the unilateral restrictions that it had
imposed in response to Indias nuclear tests in May 1998, which has paved the
way for fuller development of economic, military and technology relations
between the two countries.
Although the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11 made
the U.S. response to it, including the military campaign in Afghanistan, the
immediate and overwhelming focus of its foreign and security policy, the two
sides maintained the pace of bilateral engagement, both in response to the
challenges arising out of the events of September 11 and to pursue the longterm development of India-U.S. relations. The terrorist attack on the Parliament
on December 13 has further strengthened India-U.S. cooperation against
terrorism.
There was perceptible improvement in India-Canada relations during the

year following the announcement by the Canadian Foreign Minister in March
2001 of the intention to pursue the broadest possible political and economic
relationship with India. Canada lifted the measures imposed in May 1998
during the course of the year.
The relationship with the European Union and individual countries in
Western Europe was significantly strengthened. Post 11 September 2001, the
European Union collectively and bilaterally recognized the common strategic
priorities of India and the EU, especially on combating international terrorism.
The strength and vibrancy of this relationship was symbolized by the visits to
India of the Norwegian Prime Minister, the German Chancellor Schroeder, two
visits of Prime Minister Tony Blair, visits by almost all major Foreign Ministers
of EU countries as well as the hosting by India of the 2nd India-EU Summit at
New Delhi in November 2001.
Indias relations with the United Kingdom have been described as the
best ever, symbolized by Prime Minister Tony Blairs two visits to India and
our Prime Ministers visit to the United Kingdom. The New Delhi Declaration,
signed on 6 January 2002, in New Delhi, reaffirms this deep partnership between
India and UK, both for peace and security as well as for development. Post 11
September 2001, both countries have recognized that international terrorism
and the rise of fundamentalism and intolerance are a common menace that
requires close cooperation and dialogue. United Kingdom also expressed support
for Indias candidature for a permanent seat in an expanded Security Council.
Trade and business ties have also increased while civil society dialogue,
symbolized by the India-EU Round Table continues to enhance this important
aspect of the relationship.
Indias multi-dimensional relations with France reflected our mutual desire
to build a relationship befitting close partners with converging strategic
interests. The visit to Paris by External Affairs Minister and Raksha Mantri Shri
Jaswant Singh in September 2001 and the strategic dialogue led by the National
Security Advisor, Shri Brajesh Mishra and the Personal Representative of the

LEE
147

Introduction and Synopsis

French President, Mr. Gerard Errera, led to a better appreciation of our legitimate
concerns in the fight against terrorism and other international issues of mutual
concern. The first meeting of the Indo-French Joint Working Group on
International Terrorism held in Paris on 7 September 2001, provided an
opportunity to sensitize the French on our concerns in this area. Ministerial
level exchanges included visits, from the Indian side, by Ministers of Power,
Information & Broadcasting and Rural Development. Bilateral, economic and
commercial relations were reviewed during the highly successful visit of the
French Foreign Trade Minister in December 2001 accompanied by a high-level
trade delegation. A comprehensive review of Defence & Security Cooperation
was undertaken during the Indo-French Joint High Committee on Defence in
June 2001, at New Delhi. The Indo-French Forum, which held its 7th Meeting in
Paris in October 2001, co-chaired by Shri R.K. Hegde and Mr. Francois Poncelet,
contributed significantly in furthering civil society dialogue.
The visit of the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in October 2001
coincided with the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between India and Germany. In recognition of the deepening ties, both political
and economic, annual summit level interaction was agreed to. Economic &
commercial relations remained important and received an impetus with the
Minister of Commerce & Industrys visit to Germany. India and Germany
concluded a bilateral Extradition Treaty on 27 June 2001 during the visit of the
Minister of Home Affairs, Shri L.K. Advani. The Indo-German Consultative Forum
co-chaired by Dr. I.P. Singh and Mr. Theo Sommer made useful recommendations
in areas covering trade, international terrorism, science & technology, education
and culture.
Indias ties with Norway acquired a fresh momentum with the visit of the
Norwegian Prime Minister  19-23 April 2001. The highlight of the visit was
the unequivocal Norwegian support for Indias candidature for a permanent
seat at the UN Security Council. The decision taken during the visit to set up a
bilateral Joint Commission would provide an impetus to cooperation in the
fields of trade, energy, IT, space, environment, etc.

The 2nd India-EU Summit at New Delhi in November 2001 marked an
important milestone in our relationship with the European Union. As Indias
largest trading partner, a major source of investment and technology,
institutionalization of annual summit level interaction further cemented the
strategic partnership between India and the EU. The Joint Communiqué issued
during the Summit reiterates the common desire of India and EU to build a
coalition of interests to meet the challenges of the 21st Century while the
Declaration on International Terrorism reflects the convergence of views
between India and the European Union in the fight against the scourge of
terrorism.
Indias participation at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
postponed last year in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks to 2-5 March
2002 reflected Indias continued commitment to the Commonwealth. During
the year under review India played a constructive role as a Member of the High
Level Review Group (established in 1999 at the Durban meeting) in drafting a
report on the special theme Commonwealth in the 21st Century: Continuity
and Renewal. The report of the Commonwealth Committee on Terrorism, on
which India is a member, was also adopted. The unanimous decision to invite
India to join the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which
monitors the fundamental Commonwealth principles defining democracy,
human rights, rule of law and good governance, is another significant outcome
of the meeting.
On Italys initiative (as G-8 Chair), India was invited for consultations with
the G-8 for the first time in June 2001 in Rome. India continued to maintain
close and friendly relations with other countries in Western Europe where
exchange of views both at the official and the Ministerial level contributed to a
better understanding of our concerns and a deepening of the political and
economic relations.
Relations with countries of Central and East Europe continued to be
characterized by friendship and understanding. Changes in the politico-

Annual Report 2001-2002

economic structures of these countries have led over the years to new and
positive expectations from these relationships while keeping traditional ties
intact. Expanded economic cooperation with these countries has become thrust
area of our overall bilateral relations.
India and the Russian Federation share the vision of a Strategic Partnership
in the 21st century. The acme of the relationship during the year was the State
Visit of the Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the Russian Federation
in November 2001. The meetings with President Putin and other Russian
dignitaries fully reflected the spirit of the strategic relationship. A very
substantial corpus of agreements was signed during the visit. During the year,
various Indo-Russian institutional mechanisms remained active for the
consolidation of the excellent bilateral relations. The IRIGC (Indo Russian InterGovernmental Commission) for Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and
Cultural cooperation held its 8th Session in February 2002. The IRIGC on military
technical cooperation met twice. The strategic dialogue between the National
Security Councils of the two countries was conducted during the visit of the
National Security Adviser Shri Brajesh Mishra to Moscow in September 2001.
The Indo-Russian Working Group on Afghanistan held its second, third and
fourth meetings. Russian Foreign Minister Mr Igor Ivanov visited India twice.
Besides, the apex leadership of the two countries remained in close contacts on
matters of common concern.
Relations with other countries of Central and East Europe remained friendly
and active. Armenia expressed support for Indias candidature for the permanent
membership of the UN Security Council. Joint Commission/Committee Meetings
were held with Armenia, the Slovak Republic and Ukraine. Foreign Office
Consultations were held with Armenia, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and
Romania. The Foreign Minister of Croatia, Mr Tonino Picula, visited India and
Minister of State for External Affairs Shri Omar Abdullah visited Belarus, the
Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine. A Program of Cooperation in the fields of
Science, Education and Culture for the period 2001-2003 was signed with

Bulgaria. With Georgia, an important development was the establishment of
collaboration for the production of jeeps. Useful links and friendly ties were
similarly maintained with Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Lithuania, FYROM
(Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), Moldova, Slovenia and FRY (Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia).
India sees Africa as a repository of traditional friendships which have
acquired new meaning with emergent changes and resultant opportunities.
Continuing the tradition of high level interaction there were significant visits
to India by the Foreign Ministers of Tanzania and Madagascar, the Minister of
Agriculture of Eritrea, the Kenyan Minister of Communication and Transport
and the Nigerian Minister of Industry and focused official level visits such as
that of the Namibian Secretary to the Cabinet for studying Indian systems of
governance. The India-Africa Pharma and Health Summit at Mumbai in
September 2001 was a unique opportunity for Indian pharmaceutical and health
care companies to interact with African health care decision makers; eight of
the sixteen African delegations were led by Ministers. The Aid to African
Countries Fund offered considerable assistance in developing economic and
social infrastructure in the region. India was cognizant of the trends towards
regional economic cooperation on the African continent and took concrete steps
to construct partnership relations with organizations promoting such
cooperation.
Indias unique relationship with Mauritius was further enriched by a
number of visits at the Ministerial level including the commemoration of the
Centenary of Mahatma Gandhis visit to Mauritius where the Minister of Human
Resource Development, Science and Technology and Ocean Development, Dr.
Murali Manohar Joshi was present as Chief Guest. President Cassam Uteem of
Mauritius was the Chief Guest at the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi in
January 2002.
Indias warm relations with Nigeria were symbolized in the assistance given
by India in making democratic institutions in Nigeria more robust and the

EN
149

Introduction and Synopsis

growing economic content of relations following the earlier visit of Nigerian
President Obasanjo. A Nigerian Parliamentarian delegation visited India in
August 2001 to study Indian Parliamentary procedure.
India and South Africa were engaged in a comprehensive, mutually beneficial
relationship appropriate to their potential. The relationship is moving towards
greater substance in a variety of sectors. Indian industry was showcased at
exhibitions and trade shows organized by the CII at Durban and Johannesburg.
Notwithstanding the geographical distance and language barrier that
separate India from the Latin American and Caribbean countries, our bilateral
relations have grown considerably over the years. In particularly, the Focus
LAC Programme pursued since 1997 has started to show results with increasing
attention being paid to the region by Indian public and private sector bodies.
This has led to widespread dissemination of information on Indias commercial
and technological capabilities. In particularly, the EEPC exhibition in Caracas in
July 2001 and the ITPO exhibition in Sao Paulo in September 2001 contributed
greatly in raising Indias profile in the region. Among the ministerial visits to
the region were those by the Minister of Power to Argentina and Brazil, the
Ministers of Petroleum and Natural Gas, and of Human Resource Development,
Science and Technology and Ocean Development to Brazil and of Commerce
and Industry to Mexico. The President of Columbia paid a state visit to India in
early March 2001.
As a Charter member India believes that the United Nations should
command the trust and confidence of the international community through its
actions and be regarded as the undisputed forum for consideration of global
issues. Indias participation in the activities of the United Nations were positively
oriented and energetic. The prevailing trend of globalisation prompted India to
advocate equitable development among nations so that the asymmetry in the
benefits accruing from globlisation are reduced. The 11 September attacks cast
their shadow over the 56th UN General Assembly. The Prime Minister in his
address to the General Assembly called for a global response to international

N150

terrorism given its manifest global reach. The Prime Minister stated that the
struggle for equitable development and the war against poverty were as
important for a peaceful global order as the campaign against terrorism and
the collective search for security. Negotiations on the draft Comprehensive
Convention on International Terrorism initiated by India, recorded considerable
progress. India pointed out that terrorism could not be justified on any grounds
and only sustained international cooperation against terrorists and their
financiers and sponsors would eliminate this global menace.
In all forums concerned with disarmament India continued to call for
verifiable, non-discriminatory and universal nuclear disarmament. Consistent
with the principle of equal and legitimate security for all, Indias position on
questions of disarmament and international security was, apart from long
standing principles, also anchored on the assessment of its own national security
interests. Through multilateral, bilateral and regional dialogues on strategic
issues, there was increased harmonization of Indias national security concerns
and obligations with international concerns on non-proliferation.
The role of the Investment and Technology Promotion (ITP) Division
underwent further expansion during the year. While it continued to act as the
link between Indian Missions abroad and the relevant governmental as well as
non-governmental institutions in India concerned with two-way flows of Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) and Technology, it was further empowered as the nodal
point for international aspects of the energy sector. Greater emphasis was laid
on promotion and international liaison of the knowledge-based economy. The
Division, nevertheless, continued to identify and develop the thrust areas for
FDI and Technology as well as prepare and disseminate economic information
and promotional material to Indian diplomatic missions abroad.
The articulation of the Governments position and approach on foreign
policy issues of bilateral, regional and multilateral concern, in a transparent
and interactive manner, remained a core area of focus for the Ministry as a
whole and for its External Publicity Division in particular. Our public diplomacy

Annual Report 2001-2002

campaign was further strengthened through the widespread dissemination of
our position, jointly with world leaders during visits abroad by our Prime
Minister and External Affairs Minister, and during visits of senior foreign
dignitaries to India. Our public diplomacy efforts were also strengthened through
the use of the website of the Ministry as a dynamic tool for dissemination of
information on various foreign policy issues and Governments statement of
position. The commissioning and production of documentary films on themes
relevant to external publicity, the organization of visits of leading foreign
journalists and media personalities, the publication of thematic volumes on
foreign policy statements and events, and responses to the needs for information
from the visual, the internet, and print media on a proactive and real time basis
were also ensured.
To meet the demands placed on the issue of passports owing to the
enormous increase in foreign travel by Indians, the Ministry took steps to
simplify, decentralize and streamline passport procedures. Computerisation was
completed in 27 out of 28 passport offices.
During the year, the High Level Committee on the Indian Diaspora set up
under the chairmanship of Dr. L.M. Singhvi, M.P., visited countries with
significant populations of people of Indian origin to have first hand interaction
with the Indian community. The Committee presented its Report formally to
the Prime Minister at a function in Vigyan Bhavan on 8 January 2002. While
receiving the Report, the Prime Minister announced that (i) Pravasi Bharatiya
Divas would be celebrated on the ninth day of January every year; (ii) up to ten
Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards would be conferred on prominent NonResident Indians or Persons of Indian Origin on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas from
the year 2003; and (iii) the Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) Card Scheme would be
restructured to make it more attractive. The Ministry provided the secretariat
for the High Level Committee and has commenced further follow-up action on
the Report.
The Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation which is popularly known

as ITEC and launched in 1964 as a bilateral programme of assistance by the
Government of India seeks to address the economic needs of the developing
countries. For the Commonwealth countries of Africa, this programme is known
as SCAAP (Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme). At present
these programmes cover over 144 countries of Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and
Latin America. These programmes cover civilian and military training, projects
and project related activities such as feasibility studies and consultancy services;
deputation of experts; study visits and aid for disaster relief. About 2000 civilians
and 375 military personnel were trained last year in over 110 institutes of
national importance. Over 40 Indian experts were dispatched to countries of
Asia, Africa and Latin America on deputation. India has set up training institutes
in Asia and Africa under ITEC. Emergency supplies in the form of medicines,
food grains and other essential items are also supplied every year. Demand for
technical and economic assistance is increasing year by year. Effort is being
made to involve smaller and poor countries who have so far not been covered
under ITEC.
The administration of the Ministry including 157 Resident Indian Diplomatic
Missions/Posts and other Offices abroad continued smoothly. Special measures
undertaken during the year to heighten the efficiency and to streamline the
functioning of the Ministry were the revision and re-fixation of the Financial
Powers delegated to the Government of Indias Representatives Abroad and the
bringing out of the IFS(PLCA) Rules on a CD Rom for better and easy reference
by users. The 62nd Regional Council Meeting of the Joint Consultative Machinery
of the Ministry was held in November 2001 where various issues relating to the
Service and welfare matters were amicably resolved.
Regular efforts to promote and propagate Hindi in the offices of the Ministry
as well as in the Missions/Posts abroad continued. Highlights during the year
were holding of a Regional Hindi Conference in Budapest (6-8 March 2002) to
cover activities for propagation of Hindi in Eastern Europe; Constitution of the
Hindi Salahakar Samiti under the Chairmanship of EAM; Hindi fortnight in the

Introduction and Synopsis

Ministry from 3-14 September and setting up of the Hindi Website. Preparations
are also actively underway for the organization of the VII World Hindi Conference
in 2002.
The Ministrys Policy Planning and Research Division was designated the
nodal point for liaison with the National Security Council Secretariat, UGC
recognized Area Studies Centres of various universities; the University Grants
Commission and its subordinate bodies. Funding was extended to research
projects, seminars and colloquia on international affairs and to Track-II activities.
Presidential assent to the Indian Council of World Affairs Act, 2001 gave
effect from 1 September 2001 to the establishment of the ICWA as a body
corporate. During the year it revived the publication of two journals  India
Quarterly and ICWA-Foreign Affairs Report  on a regular basis and pursued a
vigorous programme of seminars on international affairs and subjects of topical
interest. The ICWA Auditorium had been restored and the ICWA Library had
been made fully operational.

The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) conducted the training of the Indian
Foreign Service Probationers through structured modules. It also held in-service
training programmes for the Ministrys staff. The Professional Course for Foreign
Diplomats was also conducted by FSI with the emphasis on economic diplomacy.
The Course was opened to diplomats from countries which were willing to
finance their training. The computer center of the Institute held a number of
courses for Ministry personnel.
The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) pursued its mandate of
presenting the finest aspects of Indias culture to the world and promoting
mutual understanding and cultural relations with other countries. It organized
or sponsored performances by major Indian and foreign artistes, hosted eminent
personalities under its Distinguished Visitors' programme, sent traveling
exhibitions of the arts of India abroad and supervised the admissions and overall
administration of scholarship schemes of foreign students in India.
