Afghanistan

I

ndia remained deeply concerned with the situation in
Afghanistan, which directly impacts on our national interests,
including our security concerns. The ebb and flow of the civil
conflict between the Taliban which was supported and encouraged
by Pakistan and the Government of President Rabbani, which we
recognise as the legitimate government of Afghanistan was closely
monitored by us. The continuation of the civil war principally on
account of the intransigence of the Taliban and its foreign mentor,
Pakistan, continued to bring great suffering for a people with whom
we have historical ties of friendship and cooperation.
The Taliban launched three major campaigns against the forces
of the Government of Afghanistan, especially those of Commander
Ahmad Shah Masood. These campaigns sought to drive Masood
out of Afghanistan. However, Ahmad Shah Masood was able to hold
his ground in the Shumali plains as well as north of the Hindukush.
During these operations, the Taliban targetted the civilian population,
displacing women and children and destroying infrastructure. Such
activities can only be completely condemned.
The Taliban controlled areas in Afghanistan emerged as the
breeding ground for terrorists and extremist groups and the largest

source of opium production and illegal flow of narcotics in the world,
posing a serious threat to the peace and stability of the whole region.
For return to peace, normalcy and stable government in Afghanistan
which would also help in eliminating these negatives emanating from
Afghanistan, it was essential that foreign interference, principally from
Afghanistans southern borders must cease. India remained firm in
its belief that there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem
and that Afghanistans independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity must be preserved.
India kept in close touch with many countries that have influence
and interest in Afghan affairs. It supported the efforts of the UN to
bring peace to Afghanistan. However, it was our feeling that the 6+2
format relied upon by the UN as the principal mechanism to bring
peace to Afghanistan is inherently flawed on account of its narrow
and constricted base.
Notwithstanding our lack of recognition of the Taliban, our
strong reservations about its obscurantist ideologies and our
opposition to the manner in which it has permitted itself to be
manipulated by Pakistan, we established direct contact with the
Taliban during the hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814. The
role played by the Taliban during this crisis was noted but we made it
clear that the fundamentals of our Afghan policy would not change.

India's Neighbours

As in previous years, India continued to send humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan both bilaterally and through the UN. To
ameliorate the suffering of thousands of Afghan people displaced
from the Shumali plains and Takhar province, 1000 tents, 25,500
blankets, 140 tonnes of food items and 15 tonnes of medicines, medical
supplies and medical equipment were despatched by eight chartered
flights. More consignments of medicines, shelter material and food
items will be sent in the coming months.
Iran

Indias multifaceted relations with Iran continued to grow. As a
part of continuing high-level interaction between the two countries,
Minister of External Affairs had a fruitful meeting with Dr. Seyed
Kamal Kharrazi, Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran at
New York on 23 September, 1999 during which all bilateral, regional
and international issues of mutual interest were discussed. Foreign
Secretary Shri K. Raghunath paid a visit to Tehran from 31 July-1
August, 1999 to review with his counterpart all bilateral, political,
commercial, economic, technical, cultural and consular cooperation.
He also exchanged views on regional matters and international issues
of common concern.
It was decided that for a more regular and structured consultations
between the Foreign Ministries of the two countries, four Working
Groups be formed for a more focussed attention on (i) Bilateral,
Political and Economic issues; (ii) International & Multilateral Issues;
(iii) Research & Sectoral Studies; and (iv) Cultural Cooperation.

was vacated. This was a fact that was well understood by the
international community.
The Indian armed forces began Operation Vijay on 26 May 1999
with the objective of completely evicting Pakistans armed intrusion
and aggression. While the Operation was on, the External Affairs
Minister also received the Foreign Minister of Pakistan for talks in
New Delhi (12 June 99). The Pakistan Foreign Minister was told
clearly that Pakistans armed intrusion and aggression was completely
unacceptable, that it constituted a blatant violation of the Line of
Control and the Simla Agreement and that there was no question of
any talks on this issue without Pakistan first addressing itself to
vacating its aggression against India and restoring status quo ante on
the LOC. Indias outrage at the inhuman and barbaric treatment meted
out to our soldiers in Pakistani custody was also conveyed to him. We
demanded that those guilty of these atrocities be brought to justice.
The Pakistan Foreign Minister was also told that Pakistans aggression
was a grave breach of trust and while its territorial aggression against
India would be evicted, it would be extremely difficult to restore the
trust and confidence that had been damaged by Pakistans betrayal.

approbation. It also needs to be emphasised that the importance of
the inviolability and sanctity of the LOC for maintaining peace and
tranquillity was totally accepted by the international community.
Pakistan was held as having violated this line and its efforts at terming
it as imprecise also failed. The international community also concurred
with our assertion that Kargil was a manifestation of the medieval
malevolence spilling over from Afghanistan and that there was a need
to confront and defeat such impulses, in the interest of not only our
region but also of the larger global community.
Throughout its military operations, India acted with unparalleled
restraint and scrupulously observed the sanctity of the LOC. In doing
so, our armed forces took unusually high casualties, which are a tribute
to their discipline and valour. In view of the relentless progress of
Indian forces on the ground, Pakistan had no option but to come to
an arrangement for withdrawing its troops to its own side of the
LOC. In exactly two months time from the day it had started,
Operation Vijay marked one of the great successes in the Indian
military history.
Violation of Indian Airspace by Pakistani Aircraft

The international community, while appreciating Indias position,
also pointed to the irresponsibility of Pakistans military action and
called for the immediate restoration of the LOC. India too emphasised
that the LOC was an essential confidence building measure and
indispensable for peace and security. Attempts by Pakistan to create
doubts about its clarity and validity were not only mischievous, but
also extremely dangerous and totally unacceptable to us. We also
pointed out that in the 27 years since the LOC had been demarcated
and marked on authenticated maps signed by senior military
commanders of both India and Pakistan, there had not been single
instance of its having been called into question.

During the year, Pakistan maintained its pattern of brazen
violations of the 1991 Agreement between India and Pakistan on
Prevention of Airspace Violations. On 10 August 1999, a Pakistan
Navy maritime surveillance-cum-combat Atlantique aircraft intruded
repeatedly and deep into Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch area
and was shot down by the Indian Air Force fighters when it failed to
heed to their signals to land. Part of the wreckage of the aircraft was
found inside Indian territory. Pakistan also used missiles on 11 August
1999 to target three Indian helicopters that were ferrying journalists
to the crash site. All of these actions are in keeping with Pakistans
wilful violation of confidence building measures.

The international community was kept continuously briefed of
Indias position during Operation Vijay. It was a measure of the
justness of Indias cause that our position found virtually universal

IC-814 Hijacking

An Indian Airlines aircraft was hijacked to Kandahar by five
persons on 24 December, 1999. Government secured the safe release
3

India's Neighbours

of passengers, crew and the aircraft in exchange for three terrorists,
including a Pakistani national. The hijacking was an example of
international terrorism at its worst. There is firm evidence that it was
engineered by Pakistan and fundamentalist groups that are based in
Pakistan and outside under its command and control. The Indian
authorities have also been able to identify the hijackers who are all
Pakistanis. Further, the majority of the terrorists whose release was
earlier sought by the hijackers were also Pakistanis. The destination
of the hijackers as well as of the three released terrorists was Pakistan.
Outlook for Future Relations

It was India that had initiated the composite dialogue process.
The Prime Ministers visit to Lahore was a path-breaking attempt to
reach out to Pakistan and permanently transform our relations. It
was also a manifestation of our desire to take them in a positive and
constructive direction. Pakistan embarked on a venture that
constituted betrayal of trust and revealed abiding hostility. It would,
therefore, be idle to pretend that this experience has not set back
India-Pakistan relations. The damage this action has done to mutual
relations is compounded by Pakistans continuing sponsorship of
terrorism against India as a matter of state policy.
Pakistan is now effectively under what amounts to martial law
following the military coup of 12 October 1999. The coup has
implications for our security interests and we have to take this into
account. Pakistan needs to restore mutual trust and confidence
through concrete and tangible action including the cessation of crossborder terrorism and hostile propaganda against India. The
sponsorship and instigation of cross-border terrorism by Pakistan in
Jammu & Kashmir and elsewhere in India constitutes a violation not
only of the LOC but also of the Simla Agreement. It is incumbent
upon Pakistan to abjure this brazen encouragement and abetment of
terrorism and dismantle the entire network that is set up in Pakistani
territory for this purpose. Continuous calls for jehad against India
can hardly be interpreted as messages for dialogue and peace. The

4

high-pitched propaganda against India, instances of which are rife in
the daily life of Pakistan, do not inspire confidence in Pakistans interest
in dialogue.
These are not preconditions but the very ingredients to foster
proper environment for a meaningful interaction between the two
countries.
The international community also recognises that all outstanding
issues between India and Pakistan should be settled bilaterally in a
peaceful manner. There is no place whatsoever for any third-party
mediation in this process.
Section2
Relations with our Eastern and Southern neighbours continued
to remain warm and friendly. The thrust of our policy towards this
region was to encourage mutually beneficial economic cooperation
and contacts at peoples level. Several new initiatives were launched
to achieve these objectives. Regular contacts were maintained at the
political level with a view to strengthening cooperative relations with
these countries and to sensitising them on the threat posed to the
democratic and social fabric of the region by forces of terrorism and
religious extremism.
Bangladesh

India continued to pursue a policy of further expanding and
deepening its traditionally close and friendly ties with Bangladesh.
There was a regular exchange of high level visits which contributed
to the promotion of mutual understanding and goodwill, with an
emphasis on economic cooperation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, accompanied by a
delegation which included the External Affairs Minister, Minister for
Railways and Surface Transport and Chief Minister of West Bengal
visited Dhaka on 19 and 20 June, 1999 on the occasion of the inaugural
run of the bus service from Calcutta to Dhaka. The bus service has

Annual Report 1999-2000

been welcomed by the people of the two countries with great joy. It
heralds a new dimension in bilateral relations and represents a
significant step in facilitating people-to-people interaction between
the two countries.
During the visit, Prime Minister held wide ranging discussions
with the President and Prime Minister of Bangladesh; the discussions
covered bilateral, regional and international issues. An Agreement to
extend a credit line of Rs.200 crore to Bangladesh, spread over three
years was signed. With a view to further enhancing trade, India has
agreed in principle to the Bangladeshi request for non-reciprocal dutyfree access for select items of export interest to Bangladesh. Both
sides also agreed upon the restoration of multi-modal communication
links between the two countries which should go a long way in
providing the infrastructure necessary to enable economic interaction
between India and Bangladesh attain its true potential. Both sides
also focussed on the need to provide a framework for border trade.
A proposal for the transshipment of Indian goods across Bangladesh
by Bangladesh carriers is under the active consideration of the
Government of Bangladesh. These issues will be examined by a Joint
Group of Experts.
The two Prime Ministers met again on 13 November 1999 on
the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
in Durban.
The Bangladesh Minister for Water Resources, Mr Abdur Razzak,
visited India in April 1999 in connection with the 33rd Session of the
Joint Rivers Commission. The Joint Committee of Experts on Sharing
of Waters of Common Rivers met twice during the year when
discussions were held on sharing of Teesta Waters. The Minister for
Commerce and Industries of Bangladesh , Mr Tofail Ahmed visited
India for bilateral talks on trade issues from 19-24 May 1999. The

Choudhury, visited India from 9-15 August 1999.

Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. Ajit Kumar Panja,
visited Dhaka from 20-22 January 2000, when he called on the Prime
Minister of Bangladesh and held fruitful discussions with the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture. His talks with the Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh covered the entire range
of bilateral interactions, with a view to identifying areas for focussed
attention in the coming months. An MOU on Agriculture was signed
during the visit. An important outcome of the discussions was the
decision to start a bus service between Agartala and Dhaka.
Interaction between the armed forces of India and Bangladesh
continued with the exchange of a number of high level delegations
between the two countries. The Bangladesh Defence Secretary, Mr
Mohammed Idris Ali visited India from 12-16 October 1999 along
with the Director General (Artillery ) of the Bangladesh Army and
Assistant Chief of Naval Staff on the occasion of Defexpo-99. The
Bangladesh Navy participated in the multilateral exercise MILAN-99
held at Port Blair from 30 March - 4 April 1999. Three Indian Navy
ships commanded by Rear Admiral V Bharatan made a goodwill visit
to Chittagong from 1-4 November 1999 and carried out a joint exercise
for the first time with three Bangladesh Navy ships on 4 November,
1999. As in previous years, a number of armed forces personnel of
Bangladesh also received training in India.
As part of the institutional dialogue on various issues relating to
border management, the Director General level meeting between the
Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles took place in Dhaka
from 24-28 October 1999. The Joint Working Group from the
respective Home Ministries also met in Dhaka in January 2000.
Secretary level talks on renewal of the India-Bangladesh Protocol
on Inland Transit & Trade was held in Dhaka from 26-28 October
1999. The Protocol was renewed upto 3 October 2001. The new

5

India's Neighbours

Haldia, Pandu and Karimganj on the Indian side and Narayanganj,
Sirajganj, Khulana and Mongla on the Bangladesh side have been
designated as Ports of Call. The Protocol also provides for steps to
ensure equal sharing of inter-country and transit cargo by the ships
of the two countries to and from ports of call/customs stations
including extended places of loading and unloading.
Maintaining the tradition of close and active interaction in the
field of education, India provided training facilities and scholarships
to Bangladeshi candidates under various schemes. A series of cultural
programmes by Indian artistes were also organized in Bangladesh. A
number of cultural programmes including film shows, art-exhibitions,
music concerts etc. were also organised by the Indian High
Commission in Dhaka with the participation of local artistes from
Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka

Indias relations with Sri Lanka continued to be cordial and
friendly. India expressed its consistent support for a peaceful
settlement of the ethnic conflict within the framework of Sri Lankas
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. India views the ethnic issue
as complicated and best be resolved by Sri Lanka itself.
The Minister of State (EA), Shri A.K. Panja, led an Indian
delegation to Colombo in November 1999 to represent India at the

Section 3
Indias traditional friendship and cooperation with its northern
neighbours, Bhutan and Nepal, has continued to grow over the years.
Bhutan and Nepal are our closest neighbours, and this closeness is
evident in our common social values, traditions, extensive people to
people contacts, and wide ranging economic linkages. Our focus over
the year has been on mutually beneficial economic development, which
would help to improve the living conditions of people in the three
7

India's Neighbours

countries, and particularly of the people living on both sides of the

Nepal

Several initiatives were taken to further strengthen our interaction
with Nepal, and to consolidate the close and multifaceted cooperation
between the two countries.
The Foreign Minister of Nepal, Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat, paid an
official visit to India from 17-19 August 1999. During the visit, Dr.

demarcation of the Boundary in a time bound manner. The visit
provided an opportunity to review the entire gamut of bilateral
relations between Nepal and India. A Joint Press Statement was issued
at the conclusion of the visit, announcing the various decisions taken
to further strengthen cooperation between the two countries. A
decision was taken to revive the India-Nepal Joint Commission and
expand cooperation in development of infrastructure, including

India attaches high priority to the development of economic and
commercial ties with Nepal. Engagement in Nepals economic
development in diverse areas has increased over the years. Major
projects being funded by the Government of India in Nepal include
the construction of 22 bridges on the Kohalpur-Mahakali sector of
the East-West Highway, construction of an Emergency and Trauma
Centre at Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, construction of Raxaul-Sirsiya

several other projects that form part of lndias commitment under
the Mahakali Treaty. A High Level Tasks Force (HLTF) monitors the
progress in bilateral relations and oversees Indian assisted projects in
Nepal.
Initiatives taken by the Government of India to liberalise the
trade and investment regime with Nepal have imparted considerable
momentum to bilateral economic exchanges in the recent years.
Nepals exports to India have tripled in the last three years, since the
conclusion of the renewed Treaty of Trade in 1996, and are expected
to touch the Rs. 1000 Crores per annum mark in the near future.
Indian investments account for over 40% of the total foreign
investments in Nepal. Bilateral trade during 1998-99 amounted to
Rs. 1225.56 Crores. During the period April-July 1999, the two-way
trade was Rs. 461.24 crores, while the figure for the corresponding

scholarships being provided under Aid to Nepal and TCS of
Colombo Plan besides the self-financing opportunities for studies in
India offered by the Government of India to Nepalese students in
diverse fields, notably engineering, medicine and in the field of
advanced and modern technology. Specific professional training and
orientation programmes were also conducted for select candidates
from Nepal under the Nepal Aid Scheme. A large number of Nepalese
students were also admitted to schools and colleges in India as a
special concession.
An Indian Airlines flight IC-814 with 178 passengers and 11 crew
members on board, which took off from Kathmandu for Delhi on
24th December, was hijacked by 5 armed men at 17.10 hrs. while

the hijacking. The two countries are in touch with each other to fully
investigate the hijacking.
The Third Meeting of the India-Nepal Joint Working Group on
Border Management (JWG) was held in Kathmandu from 1-3 Feb,
2000. The two sides reiterated their determination not to permit the
use of their respective territories for activities directed against the
other. They reviewed the developments since the last meeting of the
JWG and had an exchange of views on modalities for more effective
management and regulation of the India-Nepal border. They agreed
to strenghthen cooperation to control undesirable activities and the
movement of terrorists, criminals and other undesirable elements
accross the border. It was reiterated that the previlege of unimpeded
access accross the open border enjoyed by the nationals of the two
countries should not be allowed to be misused by anyone, including
third country nationals.
Bhutan

The relations between India and Bhutan are marked by mutual

10

understanding and respect and warm friendship. The mutually
beneficial economic cooperation between the two countries has been
steadily growing and continues to provide a firm basis to bilateral
relationship.
As part of our close bilateral cooperation, India has been
extending assistance to Bhutans Five-Year Plans since 1961. The VIII
Five-Year Plan (1997 - 2002) is under implementation. The
Government of India approved Rs. 900 Crores as lndias commitment
towards Bhutans VIII Plan. Of this total commitment, Rs.500 Crores
is for project-tied assistance and the remaining Rs. 400 Crores would
be provided as development subsidy to Bhutan. Separately, besides
the regular assistance under the Five-Year Plan, India is also funding
three Mega Projects i.e. the Tala Hydroelectric Project (THEP), the
Kurichu Hydroelectric Project (KHEP) and the Dungsum Cement

over the gathering momentum in regional cooperation. The military
coup in Pakistan on October 12, 1999 necessitated postponement of
the 11th SAARC Summit (scheduled for November 26-28, 1999 in
Kathmandu), as SAARC countries expressed their concern at the
prospect of holding the Summit after the overthrow of the
democratically elected Government of a Member State.

ndias relations with the countries of South East Asia have
traditionally been close and warm as we share a common historical
and cultural legacy. After the end of the cold war and since the
introduction of economic reforms in India, there has been a renewed
vigour in our relationship with the countries of the South East Asian
region. Indias Look East policy and countrys potential as a major
market have contributed significantly towards expanding and
diversifying Indias relations with the ASEAN region. The closeness
of the relationship is reflected in regular exchanges of high level visits,
like the recent visit of the President of Vietnam (December 1-5 1999),
the visit of the PM of Singapore (January 2000), the President of
Indonesia (February 2000) and the PM of Cambodia (February 2000)
to India, Joint Commission meetings with Vietnam and Laos, and
Foreign Office Consultations with the Philippines, Indonesia and
Australia etc.
India became ASEANs Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992 and
Full Dialogue Partner as well as a member of the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) in 1996. The growing ties with the ASEAN have further
developed in the recent years. The dialogue partnership with the
ASEAN has enabled India to significantly broaden and diversify its
relationship with the ASEAN member countries. The ASEAN
countries have recognised the positive role that India can play in
maintaining peace and stability in the region.

India has a fundamental interest in the regional security issues as
we share maritime boundaries with several ASEAN countries and
land and maritime boundary with Myanmar. India sought to promote
a wider and deeper contact with the ASEAN countries in the ASEAN
and ARF framework, to promote peace, development and security in
the region. Shri Jaswant Singh, External Affairs Minister led an Indian
delegation to the 32nd ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC)
and the 6th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meetings held in
Singapore in July 1999, and held bilateral meetings with his
counterparts from the ASEAN and the ARF member countries.
Currently, India is closely collaborating with the South East Asian
countries in various fields such as trade and investment, science and
technolog y, tourism, human resources and infrastructure
development. Such linkages are expected to intensify in the coming
years. Through the institution of dialogue partnership with ASEAN,
attempts are being made to identify areas for focussed interaction,
including formulation of concrete work programmes and action plans.
The total bilateral trade between India and the ASEAN countries
has increased from about US$ 2.5 billion in 1993-94 to US$ 5.98 bn.
in 1997-98 and $ 5.36 bn in 1998-99. With the regional economic
crisis having bottomed out, India hopes to increase trade both in
terms of quantity and value with the ASEAN countries and also
enhance mutual investments.

bilateral relations and cooperation. Our External Affairs Minister held
a bilateral meeting with the Foreign Minister of Brunei during ARF/
ASEAN PMC meetings in Singapore in July 1999. Bruneis Minister
for Education & Health, who is also the Chairperson of the Brunei

technical level visit from the Royal Brunei Armed Forces to India, in
November 1999, may lead to initiating tangible bilateral cooperation
in the defence field, particularly training.
Bilateral trade remained low, but not insignificant, with US$ 3.31
million as Bruneis imports from India during 1998-99. In areas like
software and IT, civil and electrical projects for construction, supply

trategic and economic factors establish the importance and
relevance of the Central Asian States (CAS) to India. Their
geo-strategic location, both as an Eurasian bridge and a close
proximity to a number of regional hot spots; abundance of natural
resources including hydrocarbons; intense rivalries of, external players
over these resources; secularist state policy; close approximation of
national security interests and concerns of the CAS and India;
attraction of the CAS markets etc., are among these factors.
Indias political relations with the CAS are excellent, underpinned
by historic and cultural bonds and, since the independence of these
countries, marked by regular high level contacts. The recent incidents
of manifestation of cross-border terrorism in a number of these
countries illustrated the commonalty of the threat faced by both sides
as well as the need for coordinated action to combat the menace.
In the economic sphere, while there is natural justification for,
and expectation of, cooperation, given the economic resources of
these countries and Indias technological capabilities, transitional
difficulties have persisted in the CAS to date, negatively impacting on
two-way trade, which remains modest. Efforts are currently being
made to encourage Indian investors to enter the manufacturing sector

in these countries through joint ventures, commensurate with their
preferred policy. There is ample awareness in the CAS of Indias
strength in a number of niche areas, including small and medium
industries, and in human resource development. Slots under the ITEC
programme have been eagerly sought and utilized by these countries.
Drawing upon each others areas of expertise, scientific cooperation
has been an on-going feature of bilateral relations.
Interactions in the cultural sphere are strong. Apart from events
at the two Indian cultural centres in Tashkent and Almaty, as well as
activities under the CEP, including reciprocal days of culture, scholarly
exchanges have taken the form of frequent visits, seminars etc.

Introduction

T

he Government of India continued its policy of consolidating
the gains of almost five decades of close ties of friendship with
the countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the countries
in this region are currently engaged in the simultaneous processes of
economic reform and political democratization. These processes,
being in line with Indias own national priorities, have strengthened
our capacity to identify ourselves with the aspirations of the people
of Africa and to engage with them in a constructive programme of
mutually beneficial cooperation.
Bilateral
Indo-Mauritian relations continued to be excellent, as in the past.
Cooperation in the sectors of education, science and technology,
defence, commerce and industry was further intensified. There were
also several visits of cultural troupes from India. Trade between the
two countries grew steadily and India is now the third largest supplier
of goods to Mauritius. The India Trade Promotion Organization
organized a successful exhibition of Indian products - INDEXPO which coincided with the Indian Independence Day celebrations. Mr.
Sikander Bakht, Minister of Industry, was the chief guest during the
exposition.

During this period Telecommunications Consultants (India) Ltd.
successfully completed their projects in Madagascar for installation
of optic fibre and radio transmission network. The Government of
India donated medicines worth Rs. 10 lakhs to check the cholera
epidemic in different parts of Madagascar. Two Indian Naval ships,

30th November, 1999 in Arusha (Tanzania). This Treaty will come
into effect after it is ratified by their Parliaments. The formation of
this Community pledges these countries to work towards a customs
union leading ultimately to a political federation. In view of Indias
excellent political relations and the growing commercial and economic
interest with these countries, as also the presence of a large Indian
diaspora in this region, it will be our endeavour to intensify our
interaction with the individual member countries of the EAC as well
as with EAC as a regional organisation.
Indias relations with Kenya were further strengthened during
the period under review. Kenya showed a constructive understanding
of Indias position on key global issues like restructuring of the UN

elations between India and the Russian Federation have been
historically close, friendly and time tested. With the countries
of East and Central Europe, we have traditionally maintained
ties based on goodwill, friendship and close cooperation. The year
saw further consolidation and diversification of these ties to mutual
benefit. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were admitted
into NATO and several of them re-oriented themselves towards
joining Euro-Atlantic Security structures and the EU. Despite these
developments, the countries of East and Central Europe reiterated
that relations their relations with India will continue to develop on
the traditional friendly basis. Indias cooperation with these countries
is multi-dimensional in character and encompasses economic,
commercial, defence, scientific and technological and cultural spheres.
Bilateral exchanges at the political level have played a significant
role in the consolidation of our ties with these countries. These
exchanges provided an opportunity towards creating greater
understanding of each others interests and concerns. Efforts were
made to renew contacts between the Parliaments of these countries.
Specific steps were taken to impart a new thrust towards the expansion

52

of trade and economic cooperation. Initiatives were taken in
diversifying our cultural relations with them.

resigned on 31 December 1999 and nominated Mr Vladimir Putin,
Prime Minister, as the Acting President. Mr Putin would also continue
to be the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Presidential
Elections are scheduled to be held on 26 March 2000 to elect a new
President of the Russian Federation.
Section 2

One of the main priorities in our foreign policy objectives
continued to be the strengthening of our time tested relations with
the Russian Federation. Our multi-dimensional relations with the
Russian Federation have been developing and expanding in all areas
of mutual interest to mutual benefit. We have sought to raise the level
of our bilateral ties to that of a strategic partnership. A Declaration
on Strategic Partnership will be signed between the two countries
during the next Summit meeting. The visit of External Affairs Minister
to the Russian Federation in May 1999 was an important milestone.
The visit to India by the First Deputy Prime Minister Khristenko
and the Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov lent further weight to our
interaction. The tradition of bilateral exchange of visits both at all

otherwise. We called for commitments to the UN Charter by pointing

Western Europe
Western Europe is a region of considerable importance to India
both politically and economically. The European Union is lndias
largest trading partner and the second largest source of approved
foreign investment. India has traditionally maintained close and
friendly relations with the EU as well as with individual countries in
the region.
Europe is witnessing rapid moves towards greater integration:
economic, political, and strategic. The European single currency Euro
was adopted by 11 of the 15 EU member states on January 1, 1999.
The decision taken at the EU Cologne summit in June 1999 to create
a Common Foreign and Security Policy and to appoint a High
Representative for Foreign & Security Policy, marked tangible progress
towards the goal of political unity. The related decision to merge the

WEU into the EU marks a major step towards the evolution of a EU
collective self-defence. The expansion of the EU is bound to enhance
its political influence, although the economic costs will, in the short
term, be considerable.
India and the European Union are both addressing themselves
to the task of moving forward relations with the EU and its member
countries economically, commercially, politically and strategically.
During this period, some concrete measures towards the objective of
an intensified dialogue on global political and economic issues with
the European Union and its member countries have been put into
effect. A steady pace of interaction has been maintained at all levels
with the Governments in West Europe. The frequency of high-level
exchanges between India and the countries of Western Europe is
indicative of a mutual recognition of the advantages of, and need for,
closer interaction and co-operation.
The dialogue which has been conducted with various West ,Asian
countries, has led to a better understanding of lndias position on
various issues including on non-proliferation and disarmament. There
has also been a considerable growth in bilateral economic ties with
these countries as well as an all-round diversification in various fields
of co-operation.
The trend of warming and deepening of relations with the EU
and its member countries was amply demonstrated in the reaction of
these countries to the Kargil intrusions. There was a clear recognition
that the situation had been caused by cross-border infiltration and
violation of the Line of Control. Indias restraint throughout the crisis
in not crossing the LOC was also acknowledged and appreciated.
Their support and understanding of lndias position and concerns
was clearly reflected in individual country statements as well as those
of the EU.
Indias relations with France have gained momentum over the
year. The high-level political dialogue which was initiated with the
57

Europe

visit of French President Jacques Chirac in January 1998 continued
throughout 1999 as well.
The momentum of the relationship is demonstrated by the
numerous ministerial visits from both sides over the year: EAM visited
France on May 26-27, 1999 for bilateral talks and to attend the OECD
Ministerial Conference held in Paris. He also had meetings with French
President Chirac, Foreign Minister Vedrine, National Assembly
President Laurent Fabius and Senate President Christian Poncelet
during the visit. The visit provided an opportunity to extensively brief
the French side and place matters relating to the Kargil developments
in perspective. Jean Claude Gayssot, French Minister of Capital Works,
Transport and Housing, visited India in February 1999; Mr Claude
Allegre, French Minister for Higher Education, Research and
Technology in November 1999; Louis Besson, French Minister for
Public Works, Housing and Transport in December 1999; and Mr.
Francois-Poncet, Co-Chairman, lndo-French Initiative Forum in
December 1999.
Two rounds of talks were held under the lndo-French Strategic
Dialogue in January and July 1999. The Dialogue was instituted
following a high-level decision taken during the Indian Prime Ministers
visit to Paris in September 1998 and aimed at facilitating structured
and regular discussions on issues of core importance to both sides.
The lndo-French Initiative Forum, a high-level non-governmental
group of eminent personalities set up advise on ways of diversifying
and enriching the bilateral relationship, held two meetings in February
and September 1999. Foreign Office Consultations were held on June
30, 1999 in Paris. The Indo-French Joint High Committee on Defence,
a committee set up to examine the possibilities for defence cooperation, including defence industrial co-operation, held its second
meeting on July 5-6, 1999. The lndo-French Joint Working Group on
Energy held its first meeting on 15-16 March 1999 in New Delhi.
The lndo-French Water Week and the Higher Education in France
58

Forum were organised in India in November 1999. The France-India

Annual Report 1999-2000

a positive ambience for promoting bilateral exchanges and
cooperation. The visits of EAM and Principal Secretary to Prime
Minister, to the U.K in January and February 1999 respectively were
instrumental in an enhanced understanding of our concerns and
position on various issues.

Interaction between India and Germany at the very highest
levels, as well as the people-to-people level has been substantial.
Germany is Indias largest trade partner in Europe and second largest
worldwide, with a bilateral trade of around DM9 billion and a major
technology and investment source with total approved investment of
over Rs 64 billion. However, economic relations witnessed a downturn
in the year with a slump in bilateral trade.
Germany was very supportive of India during the Kargil crisis. It
was the term President of the EU as the crisis unfolded. The numerous
EU statements issued in connection with Kargil clearly acknowledged
that the confrontation was triggered off by infiltration into the Indian
side of the LOC.
EAMs visit to Germany on September 30- October 1, 1999
facilitated detailed discussions with the German President Rau and
Vice-Chancellor & Foreign Minister Fischer on issues of bilateral,
regional and multilateral importance. The visits of National Security
Advisor Brajesh Mishra to Germany in February and again in July
1999 were also marked by substantive and productive meetings. Prof.

& Financial Affairs, and Personal Representative of Chancellor
Schroeder visited India on September 19-21, 1999 and had useful
interaction with Indian officials as well as with the Indian business

India of the State Secretary for Economics of Bavaria in February
1999 and of Deputy Minister-President of Baden Wuerttemberg in
August 1999 and visits to Germany of the Chief Minister of Kerala
and Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan.

eminent personalities which was set up to monitor ongoing
developments and trends in Indo-German relations, and suggest
policy measures for up-gradation of bilateral relations from a long
term perspective, held its eighth meeting on November 13 & 14,
1999 in Bangalore. The meeting generated useful ideas for the further

exchange of the first Head of State level visit between India and
Austria. Rashtrapatiji visited Austria from 7-11 November 1999 and
exchanged views with the Austrian President, Thomas Kiestil and
the Federal Chancellor, Viktor Klima. The visit has led to an enhanced
understanding of lndias position and concerns on various issues.
Rashtrapatijis visit to Austria coincided with the celebration of

Annual Report 1999-2000

50 years of diplomatic relations between India and Austria, which

as a commercial destination. The Minister of Industry, Commerce

and Tourism of the Province of Catalunya, (Spain), Mr, Antoni Subira,
visited India from May 13-14 along with a business delegation. The

trade with Spain has been steadily increasing and annual bilateral trade
stands at US$900 million. Shri Dilip Lahiri has been appointed as

main objective of the Popes visit to India was to sign and release the
post-synodal exhortation of the Special Assembly of the Synod of
Bishops for Asia held in the Vatican last year. During the visit, the
Pope expressed an appreciation for lndias secularism and religious
freedom and for the respect that Indian culture has for all religions.

communitys understanding of India as a multi-religious, multi-ethnic
society which is committed to the maintenance of secularism.

views on WTO related issues in the context of the WTO Ministerial
Meeting in Seattle from 28 November to 3 December 1999. On the
other hand, the US continues to maintain many of the unilateral
restrictions it imposed under its domestic law in the wake of the
nuclear tests in May 1998. India also received broad support from
the US Congress on several issues of concern to India.
Following the nuclear tests, India had decided to engage in a
more intensive dialogue with the United States. Shri Jaswant Singh,
External Affairs Minister and Mr. Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary
of State were designated as Representatives to conduct this dialogue.
The talks are being conducted on the basis of the comprehensive

proposals that India has put forward on disarmament and
nonproliferation matters, our unilateral moratorium on explosive
nuclear tests, willingness to discuss converting this moratorium into
a de jure obligation, our offer to enter into constructive negotiations
on FMCT and reaffirming our policies of stringent control on export
of sensitive technologies. The dialogue is focussed on four issues.
These issued are: The CTBT, the FMCT, Export Controls and
Defence posture. On Export Control issues, following the Export
Control level meeting in New Delhi from 9 - 10 November 1998,
another expert level meeting was held in New Delhi from 29 - 30
March 1999.
There was an extensive exchange of views between July 1998
and January 1999. Following the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, it was
decided that the Government that assumes office after the General
Elections in September-October 1999 would take a decision on further
dialogue with the US on these issues. The dialogue was resumed in a
meeting between Shri Jaswant Singh and Mr. Strobe Talbott on
November 16-17, 1999 in London.
The dialogue has led to some progress in creating a better
understanding of Indias security concerns by the US authorities. The
two sides have agreed that the dialogue is useful for increasing mutual
65

The Americas

understanding and for the purpose of building broad-based relations
between India and the US and should continue.
Following Pakistans armed intrusion in Kargil and during the
Operation Vijay launched to evict the intruders, India kept the US
along with our other key interlocutors, informed on the developments
and the nature of the intrusion. The US took a forthright position
regarding Pakistans armed intrusion in Kargil and called for
withdrawal of the intruders. The US also expressed appreciation of
the restrained and responsible manner in which India conducted
Operation Vijay. Indias position drew support from the US Congress
and the US media.
India and the US also had the opportunity to exchange views on
issues of mutual concern during the meetings that Shri Jaswant Singh,
External Affairs Minister, had with Ms. Madeleine Albright, US
Secretary of State, at the margins of the ARF Meeting in Singapore
on 24th July 1999 and later on 24th September 1999 in New York
during the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly.
During these meetings, the US reiterated its desire for better relations
with India.
India and the US have also been engaged in consultations on the
problem of terrorism. As part of the dialogue on matters relating to
terrorism, official level talks were held in Washington from September
2-3, 1999 which was followed by another round of official level talks
in New Delhi on 17th September 1999. The two Government have
agreed to intensify cooperation in this area. The Indo-US Extradition
Treaty, signed on 25th June 1997 in Washington, came into force
after the exchange of the Instruments of Ratification on 21st July
1999 in New Delhi. The Treaty represents an important step in the
law enforcement cooperation between India and USA in the area of
counter-terrorism.
66

As part of the process of regular consultations on bilateral,
regional and international issues. Shri Brajesh Mishra, National
Security Advisor, visited the US from 26-28 October 1999. The US
Deputy Trade Representative, Susan Esserman visited India from
1st to 3rd November 1999 for discussion on WTO related issues, in
the context of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle. From 28th
November to 3rd December 1999. The US Secretary of Energy, Mr.
Bill Richardson visited New Delhi on 26th October 1999. During his
visit, the US Secretary of Energy discussed cooperation in the fields
of energy and environment. The External Affairs Minister. Shri
Jaswant Singh and the US Energy Secretary also signed a Joint
Statement on Cooperation in Energy and Related Environmental
Aspects. General VP Malik, Chief of the Army Staff, visited the US
from 8th to 17th November 1999 to participate in the Conference of
the Defence Chiefs of Asia-Pacific Countries in Honolulu hosted by
the US Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Command.
Following the nuclear tests in May 1998, the US had imposed
certain restrictive measures against India. Effective from 1st December
1998, the US had partially lifted some of these restrictions till 21st
October 1999. In partial exercise of the fresh waiver authority given
by the Defence Authorisation Act 2000, passed by the US Congress
in October 1999, the US Government once again removed some of
the economic restrictions with effect from 27th October 1999.
However, non-basic humanitarian financing from multilateral financial
institutions is still subject to US restrictions. India regards these
unilateral restrictive measures as unjustified and counter-productive,
which should lifted in entirety. Several members of the US Congress,
including the Chairperson of the House International Relations
Committee. Mr. Benjamin Gilman, has written to the US President
to remove restrictions on the US support for loans to India by the
World Bank and other international financial institutions.

Annual Report 1999-2000

There was a considerable increase in bilateral dialogue between
India and the US during the period January to March 2000. The
dialogue on Nonproliferation, Security and Disarmament, which was
resumed in London in November 1999, was further continued from
January 18-19, 2000 in London. Apart from security issues, the two
sides also had extensive discussions on counter-terrorism, the hijacking
of IC-814, regional developments and President Clintons visit to India.
At London, the two sides announced the creation of the IndoUS Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism to institutionalise
their cooperation in combating all forms of terrorism. The Joint
Working Group on Counter-terrorism held its first meeting from
February 7-8, 2000 in Washington D.C. The two countries agreed to
share their expertise, experience, resources and information in
countering terrorism and also agreed to work together to bring the
perpetrators of the hijacking of IC-814 to justice.
The Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral
Dennis Blair, visited India from January 8-12, 2000. This follows the
visit of COAS General Malik to Washington and Honolulu in
November 1999 and together represents the first steps in revitalising
Indo-US Defence contacts.
The US Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, visited India from
January 17-19, 2000. Issues relating to trade and investment between
the two countries, the unilateral US restrictions imposed after the
nuclear tests and the resumption of the dialogue process in WTO,
following the collapse of the Ministerial Conference in Seattle, were
discussed with Treasury Secretary.
Several US Congressmen visited India in January 2000. These
included influential Congressmen such as Senator Tom Daschle,
Senate Minority Leader; Representative Sam Gejdenson, Ranking
Democrat in the House International Relations Committee; and,

Senator Sam Brownback, Chairman of the Senate Sub Committee
on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs.
Visit of President Bill Clinton

President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit India for five days
from 20th March 2000. Both sides expect that the visit of the US
President will pave the way for qualitatively new and closer relations
between the two democracies.
Canada
In the wake of Indias nuclear tests in May 1998, Canada had
decided to put political contacts with India on hold. However during
the current year. Canada has taken steps to re-establish political
contacts with India. A Canadian delegation led by Secretary of State
(Asia Pacific), Raymond Chan, visited India from 13-15 May, 1999.
During the ARF meeting held in Singapore in July 1999, EAM
had talks with the Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy. The
two Foreign Ministers also had the occasion to meet during the
Durban CHOGM in November. These meetings were utilised by
EAM to put Indias views on the question of CTBT and Nuclear
Doctrine in the right perspective.
Trade between the two countries has been on the rise. Indian
exports during the period January-August 1999 stood at Rs. 1,858
crores registering an increase of 10%. Indian imports from Canada
during the same period stood at Rs. 695 crores, up by 21%. A large
number of Indian delegations visited Canada during the year. Some
business delegations from Canada also visited India. Among the
important Indian visits, was that by a 7-member CII delegation in
August 1999. The delegation met the Chamber of Commerce besides
meeting with various Canadian business houses. These visits are
expected to result in further growth in economic and commercial
cooperation between the two countries.

The Americas

Latin America and the Caribbean
Indias relations with the countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean region have been traditionally problem-free and cordial.
The thrust of our policy towards the region is to strengthen and
widen the existing relationship and to give more economic content
to it. Our interactions and cooperation, both at the bilateral and
multilateral levels, have been mutually beneficial. India maintains, at
present, 13 resident diplomatic missions and one post in the region.
Eleven countries from the area have their resident missions in New
Delhi.
An important component of our bilateral relations has been the
mechanism of Foreign Office level bilateral consultations. Over the
years we have signed MOUs on the subject with ten countries from
the region and a few more are under consideration. The regular review
of bilateral relations has facilitated a better understanding of the
potentials and concerns of the dialogue partners and has led to
improved coordination on multilateral issues of mutual interest. Other
official and technical level visits have complemented the Foreign
Office level consultations. In the economic and trade arenas there
has been a growing interaction at the private sector level giving depth
to our relationships.
As a follow up of the FOCUS LAC Programme of the
Government of India, participation by Indian Export Promotion
Councils and business houses in international exhibitions in the Latin
American and Caribbean region as well as visits by trade delegations
to the region have helped dissemination of valuable information on
Indian commodities and technological advancement. Concerted
efforts have been made to overcome the barriers of distance and
language. In this context another important element has been the
liberalisation of many economies in the region opening up avenues
68

for enhanced cooperation. We have signed trade and economic
agreements with seven countries of the region and set up business
councils with some others. As a result of the growing understanding
between the private sectors of LAC and India, a number of accords
have also been signed between the apex trade and industrial bodies.
However, because of the economic difficulties that the region as a
whole continued to experience during the year, the actual increase in
overall trade with India was marginal and currently stands at US$
1.32 billion only.
Culturally India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region.
Indian philosophy, yoga and Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings have
been a source of inspiration for many in the region. Between them
the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have named more
than five hundred institutions, schools, libraries, streets and squares
after India and its leaders. As a mark of respect to our Father of
Nation, his busts and statues have been installed at important places
in a number of countries in the region. The latest being the one
unveiled at the campus of the University of Londrina in Brazil on
November 19 1999. The bust was gifted by the ICCR to the Centre
for Afro-Asian Studies of the University. At the institutional level we
have cultural agreements and cultural exchange programmes with
fourteen countries in the LAC area. Indian artists and academicians
have visited the region with the help of ICCR. Another interesting
aspect of our cultural relations with the Caribbean region in particular
is that some of the countries there have a substantial population of
Indian origin that still has a high regard for its cultural heritage.
Technical assistance under the ITEC Programme for students,
academicians and technical personnel for training and study tours in
India is another important mechanism by which we forge mutually
beneficial relations with the LAC countries.

Annual Report 1999-2000

The region has witnessed steady progress towards
democratisation and economic liberalisation. Presidential elections
were held during the reporting period in Antigua and Barbuda, El
Salvador, Panama, Argentina and Uruguay. In Guyana, a new President
took office due to the ill health of Mrs. Jannet Jagan and in Paraguay,
a new President assumed office after Mr. Raul Cubas resigned. The
countries in the region are steadfastly promoting regional groupings.
There has also been a tendency towards developing a Pan American
approach to national and international issues. The opposition of the
countries of the region to the US-sponsored economic and trade
embargo against Cuba is indicative of this approach. Keeping the
above in mind we have established institutional relations with regional
organisations. India has observer status with the Organisation of
American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)
and the Andean Community. Our High Commissioner in Georgetown
(Guyana) is concurrently accredited as Indias Ambassador to
CARICOM. We have been participating regularly in the meetings of
these organisations. Mechanism for dialogue with the Rio Group has
also been established and we are seeking to set up an institutional
relationship with MERCOSUR as well.

United Nations and International Organisations

Introduction

T

he year 1999 was an eventful one for the United Nations. The
Security Council had before it important matters concerning
resolution of conflicts in different parts of the world like
Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Congo and Lebanon. Debate on
important issues relating to Security Council restructuring and
terrorism continued during the year in concerned Committees and
Working Groups. India remained actively involved in all these matters
and breakthroughs were achieved in the area of terrorism where Indias
proposal for a comprehensive convention on international terrorism
has received approval for initiation of discussions in September 2000.
Public support for Indias candidature to the Security Council was
forthcoming from Russia, Vietnam and Laos.
The General Assembly was held against the backdrop of an
ongoing debate on the concept of humanitarian intervention. Kosovo
and East Timor had sensitised the world on this matter and India
continued to be an active participant in the global debate on the
subject.
Political Issues in the UN

Security Council Expansion & Indias Candidature

The Open Ended Working Group of the UN General Assembly

72

on the Restructuring of the Security Council wound up its deliberations
for the year on 30.7.99 without making any substantial progress. No
decisions were arrived at on any of the key issues including categories
to be expanded, size of the expanded Council, the question of veto
and review mechanism. The report of the OEWG recommends that
the Group would continue its work and submit its report including
any agreed recommendation at the end of the next (54th) session of
the UNGA in September 2000.
Several countries addressed the subject of UN expansion and
restructuring in their plenary speeches at the 54th UNGA. Among
these, Vietnam and Laos expressed support for Indias candidature
to an expanded Security Council. Russia also expressed support for
Indias candidature earlier during the debate in OEWG.
The question of UN Security Council restructuring was also
debated under Agenda Item 38 during the closing days of the session.
The debate only revealed the wide differences in opinion and stands
that still exist. Support for Indias candidature was expressed by Cyprus
& Mauritius.
New NonPermanent Members of Security Council Selected

General Assembly on 14th October, 1999 selected five new
members who would begin their two-year term as non-permanent
members of the Security Council starting 1st January, 2000. These
members are :

Annual Report 1999-2000

c)
d)

Asian Group - Bangladesh replaces Bahrain
Latin American Group - Jamaica replaces Brazil.
East European Group - Ukraine replaces Slovania
African Group- Mali and Tunisia replace Gambia and Gabon
There will be no change in the OEWG Group in the year 2000.

The 54th UN General Assembly

The 54th session of the UN General Assembly officially
commenced on 14th September, 1999 with the election of Mr. TheoBen Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia as the President of the
Session.
The 54th UNGA had a 172-item agenda dealing with political,
economic, social and development issues. An important aspect of
the 54th UNGA has been the focus and widespread interest on the
question of humanitarian intervention that was sparked of by the
Secretary General who led off the general debate by inviting the GA
to consider laying down terms and conditions under which
humanitarian intervention would be carried out. Opinion on the
subject was divided and it was rejected by NAM during the Ministerial
meeting on the margins of the GA.
The Indian delegation to the 54th Session of the UN General
Assembly was headed by the External Affairs Minister Shri Jaswant
Singh who addressed the Plenary Session on September 22, 1999. As
this was the last UNGA session of the 20th century, his address
surveyed the major developments of the century. The dominant
themes of the address were the global menace posed by terrorism,
including narco-terrorism, recent developments in Indo-Pak relations
and global nuclear disarmament. Indias interest in a permanent
membership of an expanded Security Council was reiterated with
EAM mentioning that by any objective criteria Indias credentials for
permanent membership are persuasive.
Other important developments from Indias point of view are

the expression of support for Indias candidature by Russia, Laos,
Vietnam, Cyprus and Mauritius in spite of the fact that debate on the
question of the UN restructuring was conclusive only in once more
reflecting the wide differences in opinions and stands that prevail.
Indias initiative in the Sixth Committee also resulted in adoption
of the Convention for Suppression of Terrorist Financing as well as
the resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism
which has the provision for discussing Indias draft of a
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism from
September 2000.
NAM

NAM Foreign Ministers Meeting was held on the margins of
the 54th UNGA on September 24, 1999 to coordinate NAMs
approach to issues deliberated during the GA session.
The meeting adopted a statement, which covered political and
economic development since the XIIth NAM Summit at Durban. It
reiterated NAM position on Security Council restructuring, selfdetermination and terrorism. It also expressed deep concern at the
updating of strategic defence doctrines that set out new rationales
for the use of nuclear weapons. It expressed deep concern over the
new Alliance Strategic Concept adopted by NATO in April, 1999
and the negative implications of the development and deployment of
anti-ballistic missile system. The statement reiterated the decision of
the Durban Summit mandating the Coordinating Bureau to study
further the question of mechanism for peaceful settlement of disputes
between member states and rejected the so called concept of
humanitarian intervention.
EAM in his address to the Meeting emphasised the need for
maintaining and reinforcing unity of the movement.

Terrorism

The phenomena of international terrorism was an important area
73

United Nations and International Organisations

of attention of the UN during the year. The Ad Hoc Working Group
of the Sixth Committee had before it drafts of the French sponsored
Convention on Suppression of Terrorist Financing which was adopted
and the Russian sponsored Convention against Nuclear Terrorism
which is still in debate.
The Sixth Committee of the UN General Assembly also adopted
the resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism in
November 1999 during the General Assembly session. This resolution
contains provision for initiating work on the Indian sponsored draft
convention on international terrorism in September 2000. The
resolution also refers to the Egyptian proposal for convening a global
conference to discuss the issue of terrorism.
Important aspects of the Indian sponsored convention are that
they lay emphasis on responsibility of states and also covers terrorist
acts in all its aspects. All previous international conventions on
terrorism concentrated only on specific acts of terrorism e.g.. terrorist
bombing, hijacking, etc.
The Convention on Suppression of Terrorist Finance and the
resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism were
subsequently adopted by the main GA on 9th December, 1999.
UN Security Council on October 19, 1999 adopted resolution
No. 1269 condemning all acts of terrorism and calling upon all States
to combat terrorism in all its forms. An important element of the
resolution is that it calls upon all states to prevent and suppress
preparation and financing of any acts of terrorism in their territories
and deny safe havens to terrorists. The resolution was adopted at the
initiative of Russia.
Peacekeeping

UNIFIL, Lebanon: The UN Security Council on 30.7.99 voted
to extend the mandate of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
for a further period of six months until end January 2000. In its

74

unanimous resolution the Council reiterated its strong support for
the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Lebanon within its internationally recognised borders. It also stresses
the need for urgent implementation of its resolution 425 of 1978
which initially set up the UNIFIL to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Southern Lebanon, restore international peace and
security and assist Lebanon to re-establish its authority in the area.
India had contributed the IInd Battalion of the 4th Gorkha
Regiment to UNIFIL. The battalion completed its one year term of
duty in November 1999 and has been replaced by a battalion from
the Madras Regiment.
Democratic Republic of Congo: On 10.7.99 in Lusaka, the
Heads of State of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia,
Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe and the Minister of Defence of
Angola signed an agreement for the cessation of hostilities between
all the belligerent forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The
representatives of the rebel forces The Rally for a Democratic Congo
and the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo declined to sign.
The agreement contains modalities for implementation of a ceasefire and establishment of a joint military commission comprising two
representatives from each party under a neutral Chairperson to be
appointed by the OAU in consultation with the parties.
It also contains provisions for the constitution, facilitation and
deployment of an appropriate force by the UN in collaboration
with OAU.
In anticipation of requirement of peacekeeping troops, the UN
Department of Peacekeeping operations has initiated contingency
planning and approached various countries, including India, to provide
troops.
India has already contributed 20 Army officers as Military liaison
officers for the UN Mission in Congo.

Annual Report 1999-2000

UNOMSIL, Sierra Leone: A peace agreement was signed
between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary
United Front of Sierra Leone in Lome on 7.7.99.
UN Security Council on October 22, 1999 passed resolution No.
1270 establishing the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The
resolution authorises deployment of a 6000-strong UN peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone.
The first group of these peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone on
29th November,1999. Among other tasks, the UN Mission in Sierra
Leone will assist the Government in the implementation of the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration plan, and monitor
adherence to the cease-fire assistance. The peacekeeping troops will

ground in Sierra Leone.

parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the months of July and October
1999 for an initial period of one year.
Kosovo: International efforts towards resolving the crisis in
Kosovo culminated in an agreement being hammered out and
legitimised vide the UN resolution No. 1244 of June 10, 1999 whereby
Yugoslav forces would withdraw from Kosovo to make way for the
entry of an international force with NATO at its core as well as a
parallel civilian interim administration under the UN flag. The UN
resolution on Kosovo clearly indicates that the political solution for
Kosovo will be based on principles enunciated by the G-8.
The UN presence in Kosovo with the acronym UNMIK (United
Nations Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo) has four main
components, each with a partner agency.
u Interim civil administration: the United Nations;

India has confirmed contribution of 2 Infantry battalions (of
which one has already been deployed), a level-3 medical unit, a quick
reaction company and a medium helicopter transport unit along with
an aviation refuelling unit for UNAMSIL. With complete deployment
of the above military configuration, India will be the single largest
contributor of troops in UNAMSIL. Other major troop contributors
are Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana. Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India
has been appointed as the Force Commander of UNAMSIL. Prior
to the creation of UNAMSIL, the UN had only an observer mission
in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL).

u

Humanitarian affairs: the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHRR);

u

Institution-building: the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); and

u

Reconstruction: the European Union.

In a related development, Mr. Oluyemi Adeniji, a senior diplomat
from Nigeria, has been appointed as UNSGs Special Representative
and Head of UNAMSIL, on 19th November, 1999.

East Timor

Bosnia: UN Security Council vide its resolution No. 1247 dated
18.6.99 has extended the mandate of UNMIBH upto 21.2.2000. India
has contributed 134 civilian police officers for the UN Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. These officers were deployed in various

India has contributed 88 civilian police officers to UNMIK. The
officers were deployed in Kosovo in early December 1999. In addition,
two companies of CRPF Rapid Action Force have also been
committed for UNMIK by the Indian government.
A major breakthrough on the question of East Timor was reached
when the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, in the presence
of the UN Secretary General signed two agreements on 5.5.99
concerning details for holding of a ballot to decide the question of
autonomy for East Timor.
After some initial delay, consultative balloting was finally held in
75

United Nations and International Organisations

East Timor on 30th August, 1999. The exercise saw 438,968 persons
or 98% of the registered voters cast their ballot. Results of the ballot
announced by the UN Secretary General on 3rd September, 1999
indicated that a total of 344, 580 or 78.5% of the voters had voted
against the proposed special autonomy status, thereby indirectly opting
for ultimate independence. The balloting was followed by an escalation
of violence and fighting between the pro-independence and prointegration factions in the Island.
In response to widespread international reaction to the killings
and the humanitarian crimes which followed, the UN Security Council
adopted Resolution No. 1264 on 15th September, 1999 and gave
approval for the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force
in East Timor. The multinational task force, going by the acronym
INTERFET (International Force in East Timor) consists mainly of
the Australian troops with contributions in various forms also from
Thailand, the UK, France, Canada, the US, Singapore, New Zealand
and some others.
This was followed by the Security Council resolution No. 1272
(1999) of 25th October, 1999 which established the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) as a Chapter
VII exercise. The resolution empowers UNTAET with the overall
responsibility for the administration of East Timor and also gives it
legislative and judicial powers. The resolution gives mandate for
UNTAET for an initial period until 31st January, 2001.
A Donors Meet for East Timor was held in Tokyo from 16-17,
December,1999 under the co-chairmanship of World Bank and
UNTAET. The donors pledged a total of US$ 522 million in a three
year programme to accelerate the nation building process
Afghanistan

International efforts under the aegis of the UN to find a peaceful
solution to the Afghan problem continued through out the year
without any success. The group of 6+2 held their last meeting in

76

Tashkent on 19-20 July, 1999, where they reiterated that negotiations
for a peace settlement in Afghanistan must be conducted under the
UN auspices in a two-stage manner, the first stage consisting of
confidence building measures including immediate and unconditional
ceasefire as well as direct negotiations and followed by the second
stage where the Afghans would themselves draw up basic principles
for a future Afghan State. Almost immediately after 6+2 meeting in
Tashkant, the Taliban launched an offensive on July 28,1999 against
other factions.
On 27th August, 1999 the UN held an open debate on
Afghanistan in which India also participated. The debate generally
saw countries taking tough positions against the Taliban.
Indian statement during the debate noted that the criminal
conduct of Taliban had negative implication for peace and security in
Afghanistan and the region. India also drew attention to international
terrorist groups who find a safe haven in Afghanistan and the
dangerous nexus between the Taliban, terrorism and the drug mafias
operating in the region. India called upon the Security Council and
the international community to take meaningful and effective measures
in this regard.
The Security Council on 15.10.99 passed resolution No. 1267 on
the situation Afghanistan. The resolution calls upon all States to deny
permission to any Taliban owned or leased aircraft to take off from
or land in their territory and also freeze funds and other financial
resources of the Taliban. This is the first time that elements of
sanctions are included in a Security Council resolution on Afghanistan.
India played an active role in the formulation of the resolution.
The sanctions on the Taliban came into effect on 14th November,
1999.
Iraq

The UN Security Council remained engaged on the question of

Annual Report 1999-2000

sanctions against Iraq for a considerable part of the year. At the centre
of their discussions were two drafts concerning economic sanctions
against Iraq. The first, a Russian resolution supported by China,
France, Malaysia and Namibia and the second one proposed by Britain
with the support of the US. The two drafts, while having common
elements on the strengthening of mechanisms for verification of
weapons and inspection systems, differed greatly on the question of
easing of sanctions.
The Security Council finally adopted Resolution No. 1284 (1999)
on 17th December, 1999.
This so-called Omnibus or Comprehensive resolution
authorises the creation of a successor body to UNSCOM called
UNMOVIC (UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission), for the verification of compliance by Iraq of various
resolutions, particularly UNSCR 687(1991).
Once UNMOVIC and the IAEA report that Iraq has been
cooperating in all respects with their reinforced monitoring system
for a period of 120 days, the sanctions would be suspended for 120
days, renewable by the Council.
Ceiling for the export of Iraqi oil under the oil for food
programme has been removed.
The United Nations programme of humanitarian assistance to
Iraq known as Oil For Food Programme continued to be regularly
extended by the Security Council.
Iraq however has given oral notification on 20th November 1999
that it rejects further extension of Oil-for-Food programme and
informed the UN that it would not renew the Memorandum of
Understanding governing the Councils Oil-for-Food programme.
South Asia Task Force

The SATF was set up in 1988 following the nuclear tests in South

Asia. Members of the SATF are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russia,
United Kingdom, United Sates, European Union and Ukraine.
The SATF held an official level meeting in Kyiv on 23rd June,
1999. In addition to the expected calls to both India and Pakistan to
adhere to the CTBT and expression of concern at the absence of
progress in the implementation of UNSCR 1172, reference was also
made to the fighting in Kargil.
The SATF also met at the official level in New York on September
7 and November 5, 1999. It is understood that the general sense in
New York was that the group had not been able to achieve much and
there was no decision on future action except that the members should
continue their dialogue with India and Pakistan and exchange views
among themselves. It is important to note that France was the only
member to insist that SATF should be wound up and that the dialogue
should be pursued at bilateral levels. Other members particularly the
US, the UK and China, wanted the group to continue.
Indo-Pak Matters

Atlantique Episode: The Secretary General of the UN
expressed regrets over the loss of lives following the downing of the
Pakistani Atlantique surveillance aircraft by the Indian Airforce and
concern at repeated incidents between India and Pakistan. He also
urged that differences between the two countries be resolved by
peaceful means.
The Security Council did not accept Chinas proposal to issue a
Presidential Statement on the subject.
Pakistan took the matter to the International Court of Justice,
The Hague and the matter is under examination by the ICJ.
Kargil: In his report on the Work of the Organisation, the
Secretary General mentioned that the recent upsurge of fighting along
77

United Nations and International Organisations

and across the line of control in Kashmir, specially in the Kargil area
is a reminder of the fragility of the situation in this region. The SG
also stressed the need to put the Lahore Process back on track.
Separately, the Kargil issue was also touched upon in the statement
issued at the end of the G-8 Summit on 20th June, 1999, where deep
concern was expressed about continuing military confrontation in
Kashmir following the infiltration of armed intruders which violated
the Line of Control. The G-8 statement also called for restoration,
and full respect in future for the Line of Control, thus vindicating
Indias stand.
Hague Peace Conference

To commemorate the centenary of First Hague Peace Conference
of 1899, the Netherlands and the Russian Federation organised an
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in The Hague from 17-19 May,
1999 to be followed by the Intergovernmental Conference at St.
Petersburg from 22-25 June, 1999.
The two IGCs were preceded by an NGO event at The Hague
on May 11-15,1999. The basic idea was to provide an alternative forum
for discussions on matters relating to disarmament, human security,
resolution of conflicts, human rights, etc. and ultimately forward the
results of the conference to the UN as input during its discussions.
The results and suggestions of the meetings are supposed to nonbinding.
Disarmament and International Security
Indias stand on issues related to disarmament and international
security in multilateral and regional forums continues to reflect Indias
national security interests and the nations tradition of restraint and
engagement with the international community. In particular, Indias
commitment to non-discriminatory and universal nuclear
disarmament continued to be reflected in Indias pronouncements
and initiatives. At the regional level, India pursued purposeful dialogue

78

aimed at building confidence, trust and cooperative security structures.
The visit undertaken by the Prime Minister to Lahore in Pakistan on
the inaugural run of the Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service, the
agreements signed during the visit as well as the visit of the External
Affairs Minister to Beijing demonstrate that given the political will
the region is capable of responsibly managing the nuclear dimension
of bilateral security equations. This certainly is an important objective
for India.
The challenge of Pakistans aggression in the Kargil sector of
Jammu & Kashmir and its attempt to question the sanctity of the
Line of Control in violation of the commitments undertaken at Shimla
and Lahore was met through a skilful use of diplomacy and military
force. The international community has appreciated the restraint
shown by India during this conflict.
The series of bilateral dialogues commenced after the nuclear
tests of May 1998 were pursued during this year with the objective of
harmonising Indias security concerns with international concerns
on non-proliferation and disarmament. The results of these dialogues
are encouraging. In particular there is greater appreciation of Indias
security concerns and the underpinning of restraint and responsibility
in Indias conduct and policies post May 1998.
United Nations General Assembly

India participated in the First Committee of the 54th United
Nations General Assembly held in New York from October 11November 12, 1999. India put forward its traditional resolutions on
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons
adopted by the General Assembly by 104 votes in favour, 42 against
and 17 abstentions, and on the Role of Science and Technology in
the Context of International Security and Disarmament, adopted by
the General Assembly 98 votes in favour, 46 against and 19
abstentions. In addition, a new resolution which was introduced by
India last year, to highlight the dangers associated with hair-trigger

Annual Report 1999-2000

alert of nuclear Weapons leading to risks of accidental or unauthorized
launch of nuclear weapons, was adopted by the General Assembly by
104 votes in favour, 43 against and 17 abstentions. India projected its
national policy on Nuclear Disarmament and was actively involved
in deliberations on a number of resolutions in the First Committee.
Conference on Disarmament

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) could not undertake any
substantive negotiations during 1999 in the absence of adoption of
its Programme of Work due to lack of consensus on two issues Nuclear Disarmament and Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer
Space (PAROS). The areas on which consensus existed included reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committees on FMCT and Negative
Security Assurances, and the reappointment of Special Coordinators
dealing with a ban on transfer of Anti Personnel Landmines (APLs),
Transparency in Armaments (T1As) and procedural/reform issues
relating to the CD. following the adoption of the traditional agenda
early in the 1999 session, the remaining time of the CD was taken up
in trying to craft a balanced and comprehensive Programme of Work,
an exercise which remained inconclusive. The only important decision
adopted by the CD during the year related to the expansion of its
membership by admitting five new members - Ecuador, Ireland,
Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia. India along with a number of other
countries remained actively engaged in the work of the CD and efforts
to reach a consensus on its Programme of Work. India remains
supportive of a comprehensive and balanced Programme of Work in
the CD.

United Nations Disarmament Commission

The 1999 Substantive Session of the UTNDC from April 12-30
in New York addressed three issues, all of which were in the final
year of their deliberations in the respective Working Groups: The
establishment of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones on the basis of
arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region

concerned (NWFZs); the Fourth Special Session of the General
Assembly devoted to disarmament (SSOD-IV); and Guidelines on
conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament, with
particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of
General Assembly Resolution 51/45 N (CD). The UTNDC reached
consensus on Guidelines pertaining to NWFZs and CD. No
consensus was possible on SSOD-IV due to absence of agreement
on the Chairpersons Paper concerning the Objectives and Agenda
of SSOD-IV. Indias position was that SSOD-IV should reaffirm
the principles and priorities of SSOD-1, which accord priority to
nuclear disarmament.
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)

As an original state party to the CWC, India has endeavoured to
discharge, fully and faithfully, its obligations under the Convention.
On 29th April 1999, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW), which is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands
completed two years of its existence. During this period, the Technical
Secretariat (TS) of the OPCW has conducted more than 400
inspections at chemical weapons storage and former production
facilities, as well as at industrial plant sites in States Parties to the
Convention. A number of inspections have taken place in India, and
our cooperation with the OPCW in implementing the CWC has been
impeccable. As a member of the Executive Council from the entry
into force of the Convention, India has been playing an active role in
the deliberations of the Council to oversee the implementation of all
obligations assumed by States Parties. The lack of progress in
implementing some of the provisions of the convention that are of
interest to the developing countries, such as those relating to
International Cooperation and assistance, casts a shadow on what is
otherwise a unique disarmament treaty. It is also a matter of collective
concern that some States Parties have not provided full declarations
to the OPCW, adversely affecting the inspection schedules.

United Nations and International Organisations

Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention

India actively participated in the work of Ad Hoc Group of States
Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in
Geneva during 1999 to negotiate a Protocol on the basis of the agreed
mandate. The Indian delegation continued to support strengthening
of BTWC through an effective Protocol for creating a nondiscriminatory and transparent compliance regime including the
unimpeded exchange of bio-technology for peaceful purposes.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

The 43rd General Conference (GC) of the IAEA was held from
September 27 - October 1, 1999. The Indian delegation was led by
Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission. After
25 years a resolution on amendment to Article VI of the IAEA Statute,
relating to the membership of the Board of Governors, finally received
the approval of the General Conference. The Board of Governors
was expanded by 8 seats from the present 35 to 43. The final proposal
increases the seats for Middle East & South Asia (MESA), the area
group India belongs to and is the Chairman of, by 1 elected and 1
designated seat. Presently MESA has 1 designated seat (India) and 3
regular seats as well as 2 floating seats shared between 3 area groups.
In the Committee of the Whole, India as the Chairperson of the
Group of 77, introduced the resolutions pertaining to Strengthening
of the Agencys technical cooperation activities, Plan for producing
potable water economically, Extensive use of isotope hydrology for
water resource management, Staffing of the Agencys Secretariat and
Women in the Secretariat.
Third UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful
Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE-III)
The third UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space (UNISPACE-III) was held at Vienna in July 1999.
Professor U.R. Rao of India was elected as President of the
Conference. The Indian presence at the Conference was active and
80

positive: India participated in the Space Exhibition, the Technical
Forum meeting organised workshops, and also supported the Space
Generation Forum (for youth). The Conference adopted the Vienna
Declaration which essentially recognises the need for international
cooperation in the peaceful uses of the outer space and outlines
definitive recommendations to achieve these objectives.
Anti-Personnel Landmines (APLS) and Small Arms

India remains fully committed to the eventual elimination of AntiPersonnel Mines (APLs). The current humanitarian tragedy of antipersonnel mines has been caused by their illegal and irresponsible
exports and indiscriminatory use. India has always refrained from
exporting APLs and is of the view that the individual moratoria on
exports should be strengthened by developing a universal agreement
that would ban such exports and transfers. India is not a party to the
Ottawa Convention because our own legitimate security concerns
require us, in view of long land border, to make use of APLs in a
purely defensive mode. Indias responsible use of APLs has been
universally acknowledged, including by the ICRC. India is a major
contributor to UN demining efforts since its participation in the
Congo peace keeping operations in 1963. Experts from the Indian
Armys Corps of Engineers have been associated with UN demining
efforts in Angola, Rwanda, Mozambique, Somalia and most recently
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
India is a party to the Protocol - II of the Inhumane Weapons
Convention and was actively involved in strengthening this Protocol
during the 1995-96 negotiations. Indias instruments of Ratification
on Amended Protocol - II on Anti-Personnel Landmines and
Protocol-IV on Blinding Laser Weapons were deposited with the
UN Secretary General on 2 September 1999. India put forward the
idea of a complete ban on use of APLs in situations other than
international armed conflict but this suggestion did not enjoy
agreement among all the countries. India had also made suggestions

Annual Report 1999-2000

for banning Remotely Delivered Mines (RDMS) as well as a complete
ban on all transfers of APLs and IEDs (Improvised Explosive
Devices). These proposals still remain on the table and India hopes
that they will enjoy greater support at the forthcoming meeting in
mid-December.
The First Annual Conference of States Parties to the Amended
Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW) was held in Geneva, 15-17 December 1999. The Conference
adopted a declaration calling on all States that have not done so to
ratify Amended Protocol II as soon as possible. India participated
actively in this Conference. While reiterating its commitment to the
objective of the total elimination of landmines, India supported a
phased approach that would balance the humanitarian considerations
arising from an indiscriminate use of landmines on one hand, and
their use for legitimate purposes of self-defence by States.
During the past decade, the issue of small arms proliferation has
become a major concern. These weapons have become more portable
and at the same time more lethal. Non-state actors such as terrorists,
drug smugglers and organised crimes syndicates find it easy to procure
these weapons and use it against civil societies and law enforcement
agencies. India has a strict arms licensing policy with production of
small arms and ammunition being undertaken in ordnance factories.
Proliferation of these weapons during the Afghanistan war had led
to large quantities of such weapons being smuggled into India in
order to perpetrate the low intensity conflict and step up acts of
terrorism and violence. India has repeatedly called for concerted
international efforts to stem illegal manufacturing and trafficking of
small arms and explosives. India has welcomed the call for an
international conference in 2001 and remain actively engaged in the
negotiations of a Firearms Protocol as part of the Convention on
Transnational Organised Crime.

Bilateral Dialogue on Confidence Building Measures
(CBMs); ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)

Indias approach to confidence building has unilateral, bilateral
and regional aspects. The Bilateral Confidence Building Measures
(CBMS) have been negotiated both in the India-Pakistan and the
Sino-Indian context. With Pakistan, conventional CBMs were sought
to be supplemented with nuclear and missile related CBMs in the
framework of the MOU signed between the Foreign Secretaries of
the two countries at the February 1999 Lahore Summit. The agreement
also envisaged updating of conventional CBMs in the light of new
realities. However, Pakistans aggression in Kargil constitutes a setback
to this process.
As regards China, the brief hiatus in dialogue post-May 1998 is
now over. India and China have agreed to begin a security dialogue
following the visit of the External Affairs Minister to China. India
and China have a number of conventional CBMs in place. India would
be prepared to enter into bilateral restraint arrangements also in the
nuclear field taking into account the unilateral commitment of both
countries to no-first-use.
At the Asia-Pacific level, the only arrangement for a regional
security dialogue is the ASEAN Regional Forum. ARF has been
focussing on building confidence and trust and has built a basket of
proposals on CBMS, which can be negotiated. External Affairs
Minister led the Indian delegation to the 6th ARF meeting held in
Singapore on July 26, 1999. The meeting was followed by PostMinisterial Conferences (PMC) with the ASEAN. The ARF/PMC
meetings provided an opportunity for a wide range of bilateral contacts
including with the US, China, Japan, Russia and some ASEAN
countries. Unlike the ARF Meet in Manila last year when nuclear
testing by India was in focus, there was no discussion on India-specific
issues. There was a general reference in the Chairpersons statement
issued at the end of the meeting for states that had tested nuclear
81

United Nations and International Organisations

weapons last year to exercise restraint, including by adherence to the
CTBT. In our bilateral contacts, Indias restraint on Kargil was
appreciated and the Chairpersons statement endorsed our stand on
bilateralism. Officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and the
Ministry of Defence continued to participate in the inter-sessional
meetings of the Forum.
Environment and Sustainable Development Issues
The Seventh Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable
Development (CSD), established by the ECOSOC to review progress
in the implementation of Agenda 21 (Sustainable Development - Earth
Summit, 1992), was held from April 19-30, 1999. The main themes
were Tourism, Changing Consumption and Production Patterns,
Oceans and Seas, and, Small Island Developing States - Programme
of Action. The issue of oceans governance was a major point of
discussions in the Oceans and Seas segment. It was agreed that there
would be a more comprehensive review of oceans-related matters by
the UN General Assembly, which will be the sole forum in which
coordination of oceans issues will take place.
The VIIth Meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP-VII) of
the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands was held in San Jose, Costa
Rica from May 10 to 18, 1999. Among the issues before the
Conference was the question of adoption of guidelines for (a)
integrating wetlands conservation and wise use into river-basin
management and (b) for international cooperation under the
Convention. The Indian delegation actively participated in the
negotiations and ensured that Indias concerns were adequately
addressed, including by stipulating that the implementation of these
guidelines is to be in accordance with the national plans and priorities.
The meeting of the Subsidiary Bodies of the Convention on
Climate Change was held in Bonn from May 29 - June 11, 1999 to
discuss the flexibility mechanisms of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the
82

Convention, available to the developed countries, in order to achieve
their legally-binding caps on Green House Gases emissions. This
was preceded by a meeting of the Group of 77 and China on May 2930, 1999, at which India was appointed as the Coordinator and the
Spokesman of the Group on mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.
The meeting agreed that the priority should be accorded to the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), one of the three flexibility
mechanisms under the Protocol. The Group also agreed on a paper
outlining its perspectives on the CDM, which was submitted to the
5th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) which met in Bonn from October 25November 5, 1999.
The 5th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Bonn from October 25November 5, 1999. It considered the implementation of the Buenos
Aires Plan of Action and in this context decided to have additional
meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies to help COP VI in arriving at
decisions as set out in the Plan of Action. In addition to its position
paper on the Mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, G-77 and China
had tabled before COP V, additional papers on two of the Mechanisms,
viz , the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Emissions
Trading were tabled. India played a leading role in the meeting of G77 and China in this regard. The Conference also decided to authorise
the consolidation of a text for further negotiations on the Mechanisms
so as to be ready for adoption at COP VI.
Economic And Social Commission For Asia And The Pacific

The most important event relating to Economic And Social
Commission For Asia And The Pacific (ESCAP) from Indias point
of view was the Second Ministerial Conference on Space Applications
for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific held in New
Delhi from November 15-20, 1999.
The Ministerial segment of this important conference was

Annual Report 1999-2000

inaugurated by the Prime Minister. The Conference was attended by
20 ministers from 27 ESCAP member countries participating in it. It
served as an excellent exposition of Indias achievements in the use
of space systems towards sustainable development and showcased
Indias capabilities for sharing its experience with other countries in
the region. The Delhi Declaration on Space Technology Applications
in Asia and the Pacific, unanimously adopted at the Conference, is a
landmark in regional cooperation with particular emphasis on national
capacity building and enhancing the regional capability in space
technology applications, through the participation of countries of
the Asia Pacific region.
In addition, there was the annual ESCAP Commission Session
held in April 1999 and the regular intergovernmental and other
Committee meetings, in which the delegations from India participated
actively .
Development Issues

The Working Group set up by the 53rd UN General Assembly
to prepare for the International Conference on Finance for
Development adopted its report at the concluding substantive session
on 27th May, 1999. An inclusive agenda list, incorporating issues of
interest to India such as, trade and reform of financial architecture
was the main feature of the Report in the drafting of which India had
a major role to play as one of the two Vice-Chairmen. The 54th
session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the
basis of these recommendations. The text of the resolution on
financing for Development was satisfactory from Indias view point
as it preserves the outcome of the preparatory process thus far and
sets in place a similar process on substantive matters. The Conference
on Financing For Development to be held in 2001 is expected to be
a high-level inter-governmental event, with ministerial level
participation.
The 54th UN General Assembly adopted by vote the resolution

on international financial stability with the US setting out their position
that the UN had no role to play in this area, which should be left to
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
United Nations International Narcotics Control Bureau

The 67th session of United Nations International Narcotics
Control Bureau was held from November 1-18 ,1999. The meeting
was attended from Indian side by Member, International Narcotics
Control Bureau. He criticized the UN International Drug Control
Programmes policy of maintaining contacts with Taleban government
in Afghanistan and for ignoring Taleban complicity in the cultivation
of illicit opium crops.
Social, Human Rights and Humanitarian Issues
In the discussions on human rights issues in sessions of the UN
Commission on Human Rights, the Sub Commission on Promotion
and Protection of Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council
and the General Assembly, Indias participation was substantive and
constructive.
The 54th session of the UN General Assembly adopted 250
resolutions , 19 of which were on the strengthening of the machinery
for coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance by the
UN , with regard to 19 countries either recovering from conflict or
devastated by natural and man-made disasters. The Assembly
commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights
of the Child and decided to convene a special session in September
2001 to review the implementation of the goals of the 1990 World
Summit for Children. Assembly also adopted an Optional Protocol
to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination
Against Women (CEDAW) which was opened for signature on
October 6,1999 and will enter into force, once ratified by 10 states.
The resolution on right to development was voted upon.
83

United Nations and International Organisations

India participated actively in the 55th session of the UN
Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva from March 22 to
April 30,1999 and made significant contribution to the substantive
issues, consensus building and decision-making . The session was
preceded by meeting of 8 working groups of the Commission on
various issues mandated to these working groups, such as indigenous
people, migrant workers, children in armed conflict and child
prostitution and child pornography. India revived a resolution on the
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which was
adopted by consensus and was the leading sponsor of resolution on
Mainstreaming Technical Cooperation which was adopted by vote in
the session of UN Commission on Human Rights. India also piloted

issues.
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)s Substantive
Session was held from July 5-30, 1999 in Geneva. The ECOSOC
considered the reports of its various subsidiary bodies in the fields of
economic and environmental matters and social and human rights
questions. The high level segment during the session focussed on the
theme - the role of employment and work in poverty eradication: the
empowerment and advancement of women. The Ministerial
Communique issued on the focal theme adequately reflected Indias
position with regard to sustained economic growth being the key to
poverty eradication and employment generation.

tension, leading to further conflict and confrontation.
India was an active participant in the 27th International
Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent held from October
31 to November 6,1999. India contributed actively to drafting of the

stressed its commitment to the protection of asylum seekers, the
significant contributions made by developing countries to refugee
issues and the importance of international solidarity and burden
sharing . India also emphasized the need to tackle poverty which is

This Division attended the Diplomatic Conference on the
Adoption of the Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention for
the Protection of Cultural Property. The Protocol seeks to make the
rules regarding grant of special protection to cultural property more
liberal. A simplified regime is expected to provide more flexibility
regarding the eligibility of cultural property to become specially
protected. Once a property is placed under special protection then
any violation of such property either by using it for military purposes
or making such property an object of attack will be treated as a serious
violation. This puts an obligation on the Parties either to try or
extradite the offender. The Protocol, also prohibits acts of hostility
directed against any cultural property and puts an obligation on states
to make such offences punishable. However, the concept of military
necessity has been retained and the Protocol lists out the conditions
under which the obligations may be waived in case of imperative
military necessity.

Foreign Economic Relations

Economic Division

T

he year 1999-2000 saw a significant improvement in the global
economic situation. The financial crisis that plagued the world
in 1998 and 1999 definitely bottomed out. The East Asian
region came out of recession through disciplined macro-economic
policies and structural reforms. The growth in the world economy is
set to gain moderate strength in the coming years. It may, however,
be necessary for governments to resist pressures from special interest
groups to take protectionist measures, as such measures may be
counterproductive and undermine a promising economic
environment.
The launch of the EURO on 1 January 1999 to replace the national
currencies of eleven countries of the European Union (EU) was a
major step taken by the EU towards economic integration. The EURO
was expected to enable the EU to exert a greater influence over the
direction of the world economy.
Indias trade and economic relations with other countries
continued to expand during the year. Efforts by the Ministry and
Indian Missions abroad to promote foreign trade and Indian
investment abroad continued. Indias total exports amounted to
Rs.1416 billion during April 1998 - March 1999 as against Rs.1301

90

billion during April 1997 - March 1998. The exports from the country
during April 1999 - July 1999 stood at Rs.474 billion compared to
Rs.417 billion in the corresponding period in 1997-98. The European
Union continued to be Indias principal trading partner. The other
major trading partners were the USA, Japan, China, UAE and Russia.
Major commodities of Indias exports included agricultural and allied
products, marine products, iron ore, leather goods, gems & jewellery,
chemicals and related products, engineering goods, electronic goods
and textiles.
Export promotion activities such as organizing and participating
in trade fairs, exhibitions and seminars both at home and abroad
continued. Besides the annual India International Trade Fair held in
New Delhi in November 1999, the 13th India Engineering Trade
Fair organized by the Confederation of Indian Industries in New
Delhi in February 1999 with the Republic of Korea as the partner
country, a seminar-cum-exhibition on technology in electronics
organized by the Department of Electronics in New Delhi in February
1999 and an India International Maritime Expo in Goa in October
1999 supported by the Ministry of Surface Transport were some of
the notable trade promotion events held in India. The Ministry
sponsored a Made in India Show along with the Confederation of
Indian Industry in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in August 1999. A trade

Annual Report 1999-2000

fair in Panama City in March 1999, an international trade fair in Athens
in September 1999, the Israel Agritech Exhibition 1999 in Haifa also
in September 1999, and the International Leather Goods Fair at Messe
Oftenbach, Germany were some of the exhibitions abroad in which
Indian Missions abroad played a very significant role.
India continued to encounter certain problems in the area of
exports, such as the European Unions anti-dumping/anti-subsidy
cases against Indian products. India has been one of the most targetted
countries for trade defence instruments like anti-dumping duties. Antidumping/anti-subsidy investigations were mainly directed towards
textiles, pharmaceuticals and iron and steel sectors where Indian
exports are competitive. India shared the first position with China
for the largest number of cases since 1994, with 22 investigations
each out of a total of 175. Out of the 29 new investigations initiated
in 1998, India shared the top position with South Korea with 7 cases
each. Of the provisional measures in 30 cases in 1998, India was
again the country affected by the largest number of cases, namely
seven.
The Ministry has worked closely with the Ministries of Labour,
Commerce and Textiles on the issue of child labour, and in the setting
up of the mechanism by the Ministry of Labour for the investigation
of complaints relating to the use of illegal child labour in the export
consignments of goods such as hand made carpets.
India has also been facing some difficulties in the matter of export
of textiles to the countries of the European Union (EU). While the
Memorandum of Understanding on Textiles signed by India and the
EU on 31 December 1994 provides for the grant of exceptional
flexibilities by the EU for better utilisation of quotas, the EU has not
granted such flexibilities in 1998 and 1999. The Ministry has been
working closely with the Ministry of Textiles on this issue. The matter
has been taken up with the European Commission and the EU
national governments and is being actively pursued.

The Ministry continued to support and encourage Indian
investment abroad with a view to promoting Indias economic
cooperation with other countries. In 1999-2000, the Ministry cleared
241 proposals for the setting up of Joint Ventures/ Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries abroad. The Ministry has been responding positively to
the Reserve Bank of Indias proposals with regard to simplification
of procedures for Indian investment overseas. Indias important
investment destinations were the USA, UK, UAE, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Engineering and
construction, software, telecom, textiles and allied produces, chemicals
and pharmaceuticals, leather and rubber products, iron and steel,
consultancy and trading and marketing were some of the notable
areas of collaboration. The Ministry has been working closely with
various governmental and other bodies in the matter of promoting
overseas exports and investment. It is represented in the Governing
Bodies of OCCI, ITPO, IRCON Ltd, WAPCOS and ONGC Videsh Ltd.
Exchanges between India and other countries on economic
related matters at official and unofficial levels continued. The Second
India-UK Annual Talks on International Economic & Financial issues
took place in London in May 1999. The third round of dialogue
between the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of
International Trade & Industry (MITI) of the Government of Japan
was held in Tokyo in February 1999. Shri Jaswant Singh, Minister of
External Affairs, paid an official visit to Japan from 23-27 November
1999. He had discussions with his counterpart and others in the
Japanese Government on several bilateral matters including IndiaJapan economic relations. An economic commission sponsored by
the MITI of Japan proposes to visit India shortly to study and examine
the avenues of investment. A meeting of the India-Japan Joint Business
Council is also proposed to be held in the near future. There also
have been visits of commercial and industrial delegations from India
to other countries and from the other countries to India .
91

Foreign Economic Relations

Exchanges took place between India and other developing
countries in the area of technical training under the Colombo Plan
and the Technical Cooperation Programmes. Under these
programmes Government of India nominees participated in training
programmes in Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore in such fields as
health, family planning, environment, urban development, housing,
quality control, irrigation and drainage engineering and taxation.
Following Indias nuclear tests in May 1998, some countries
imposed certain restrictive economic measures against India. The
Government of India had explained the rationale behind the nuclear
tests and has been continuing the of dialogue with key interlocutors
with regard to the withdrawal of the restrictive measures. The USA
has recently announced relaxation of a number of restrictive economic
measures against India. Exercising the authority given to him under
the Defence Appropriation Act passed by the US legislature in
October 1999, the US President waived, for an indefinite period,
restrictive measures against India in respect of the following:
i)

Activities and programmes of the Export-Import Bank (EXIM
Bank)

ii) Activities and programmes of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC)
iii) Assistance under the International Military Education and
Training Programme (IMET)
iv) The making of any loan or the providing of any credit to the
Government of India by any US bank
v) Assistance to the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund, the
Rhinoceros and Tiger conservation Fund, and the Indo-American
Environmental Leadership programme and
vi) Any credit, credit guarantee, or other financial assistance provided
by the Department of Agriculture to support the purchase of
food or other agricultural commodity.
92

Multilateral Economic Relations
The year under review witnessed an improvement in the global
economic situation. Although still undergoing some post-crisis
symptoms, there were definite signs of recovery in South-East Asian
countries like Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand where various strict
fiscal and economic measures were rigorously implemented. Most
multilateral groupings focussed on ways and means to prevent
recurrence of crisis-like situations in the future. Besides questioning
the validity of blind adherence to globalisation, they also focussed on
critical issues like reform of the international financial architecture
and containment of social impact of future crises. During such
deliberations, it was generally acknowledged that the cure to the
economic malaise would require active collaboration between the
developed and developing countries.
India played an active role during the deliberations of various
multilateral and regional groupings like the Group of 15 (G-15), Group
of 77 (G-77), Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IORARC). The Ministry of External Affairs monitored such developments
and actively participated in all such deliberations in the light of our
long-term national interests. Further, the Ministry, through its various
Missions abroad, collaborated with other GOI Departments and
agencies in promoting foreign business investment and presence in
India in important infrastructural sectors like power, information
technology, telecom, etc.
Similarly, in various international fora, India pointed out that
globalisation has not led to economic growth or increased the per
capita incomes in many developing countries. In order for it to become
sustainable, the globalization process would have to give due regard
to the economic development objectives of developing countries. The
shortfall in the flow of official development assistance as also the

Annual Report 1999-2000

inherent shortcomings of private financial flows would have to be
remedied. Accordingly, the international community would have to
address three fundamental issues - a stable level of financial flows to
developing countries, initiatives to reincorporate world economic
growth, and consultations for the design of a new financial
architecture.
Besides the above issues, during the latter part of 1999, the
multilateral circuit was largely dominated by discussions on the World
Trade Organization (WTO) issues of mutual concern, which were
taken up at the third WTO Ministerial Conference at Seattle. EAM
met Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, United States Trade
Representative, in Paris on 26 May 1999. During the meeting, the
External Affairs Minister (EAM) reiterated Indias principled position
on various areas of importance in the context of the WTO, including
the proposed Millennium Round, Industrial Tariffs, Agreement on
Agriculture and Information Technology Agreement - II.
The Ministry contributed tangibly to the preparatory process for
the Seattle Ministerial by ascertaining positions of important WTO
members through its Missions. Besides participating in the interministerial exercise to finalise Indias strategy for the Seattle Meeting,
Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also collaborated with the Ministry
of Commerce in organizing a G-15 Ministerial Meeting at Bangalore
in August 1999 in preparation for the Third WTO Ministerial
Conference at Seattle. MEA officials also participated in the G-77
Ministerial Meeting held at Marrakech, Morocco, in September 1999
where a message was issued by the G-77 Ministers to the Third WTO
Ministerial Conference about the concerns of developing countries.

in Uruguay Round Agreements on Anti-Dumping, Subsidies, TRIPs,
operationalization of Special and Differential Treatment provisions,
etc. Under the Agreement on Agriculture, India maintained that it
was important not only to reduce subsidies on agricultural exports
but also to focus on concerns of developing countries in matters
such as food security, rural employment, etc. India was however, willing
to show flexibility in areas such as e-commerce and information
technology.
The ASEAN-India Dialogue Partnership received a further fillip
with Indias participation led by EAM in the 32nd ASEAN Post
Ministerial Conference (PMC) in Singapore on 27-28 July 1999.
Besides participating in the multilateral plenary sessions, EAM also
had bilateral meetings with Ministers from some ASEAN and
Dialogue Partner countries. In his detailed intervention on the
international economic and financial situation, he mentioned that due
attention would have to be paid to the specific priorities of each
country in order to make globalisation a more humane and equitable
process.
Indias bilateral exchanges with ASEAN were also most rewarding.
ASEAN conveyed appreciation for the support given by India to
various activities in ongoing areas of cooperation through mechanisms
such as the ASEAN-India Fund to which India, contributes to the

At the Seattle Ministerial Conference of WTO, India categorically
rejected any attempts to link trade with labour, or trade with
environment. India also emphasized the need to take remedial action
on implementation issues pertaining to asymmetries and inequities

A GOI delegation participated in the meeting of G-15 Experts
on the Financial Crisis and the Reform of the International Financial
Architecture held in Cairo from 23-24 October, 1999. The meeting
offered a useful opportunity for interaction on important issues such
as capital account liberalization, monetary management and foreign
debt, strengthening of the banking system, role of monetary and fiscal
policy in financial markets, good governance, social safety nets, early
warning mechanisms and review of the role of credit rating agencies.
An Indian delegation also participated in the G-15 Symposium on
Globalization and its Economic and Social Impacts  A South
Perspective held at Cairo on 22-23 November 1999, and presented
an important paper on Globalization and the Trade of Developing
Countries. The discussions focussed on various aspects of
globalization such as the world economic and social environment

India participated in the South-South forum of G-77 Ministerial
Meeting on 24 September 1999 on the margins of UNGA. The G-77
adopted a Ministerial Declaration which covers the global economic
situation highlighting issues such as globalization and interdependence,
international trade matters as evolving in the WTO, financing for
development, Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the
external debt of developing countries, environment, science and
technology, etc. The meeting also adopted a statement on the
forthcoming South Summit to be held in Havana, Cuba in April 2000.
The G-77 Ministerial Declaration followed up on the G-77 Ministerial
Meeting held in Marrakech, Morocco from 14-16 September 1999.
The Marrakech Meeting discussed preparatory action for the Tenth
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTADX) to be held in Bangkok in February 2000, as well as the WTO
Ministerial Conference in Seattle. Multilateral trade issues, as
highlighted in the Marrakech Declaration, were reiterated in the G77 Ministerial Meeting in New York.
India participated actively in the grouping of Indian Ocean Rim
Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). A high-level
Indian delegation, led by External Affairs Minister, participated in
the Second IOR-ARC Ministerial Meeting, which was held in Maputo,
Mozambique from 30-31 March 1999. The Ministerial Meeting was
preceded by a Seminar on Trade & Investment in IOR-ARC Region
held on 26-27 March 1999, and a meeting of the Committee of Senior
Officials on 28-29 March 1999. Mozambique will chair IOR-ARC
meetings until 2001, when, Oman - after convening of the Third
IOR-ARC Ministerial meeting in Muscat in 2001  will assume
Chairmanship of the grouping.
The IOR-ARC Ministerial Meeting decided to expand the
Associations membership by admitting five new members, namely
Bangladesh, Iran, Seychelles, Thailand and United Arab Emirates.

Annual Report 1999-2000

The Ministerial Meeting also decided to extend Dialogue Partner status
to Egypt and Japan. The IOR-ARC Ministers met again in New York
in September 1999 on the margins of UNGA session for discussions
on the IOR-ARC Extraordinary Meeting of Ministers in Oman in
January 2000 and other IOR-ARC issues.
A meeting of Experts of IOR-ARC was held at Maputo on 8-10
December 1999 to finalize three draft documents for the grouping Instrument of Acceptance, Rules of Procedure, and a Headquarters
Agreement between the Government of Mauritius and the IOR-ARC
Coordinating Secretariat. A clause requiring all new members to extend
Non-discriminatory (MFN) trade treatment to all members of the
grouping was incorporated in the Instrument of Acceptance. All the
three documents were considered and approved by the Special Meeting
of the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO) and the Extraordinary
Meeting of the Council of Ministers held at Muscat, Oman from 2023 January 2000. The meeting also considered and approved dialogue
partnership status for UK and China. No consensus emerged on the
French application for membership. In case of Pakistan, the Council
of Ministers decided that membership would be considered upon its
adhering to non-discriminatory trade treatment to all members of
IOR-ARC and signing the Instrument of Acceptance.
The first meeting of the IOR-ARC Working Group on Trade
and Investment was also held on 20 January 2000 at Muscat prior to
the CSO meeting to discuss issues of trade facilitation, trade
promotion, technical cooperation among members.
India took active interest in the sub-regional grouping called
Bangladesh  India  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  Thailand Economic
Cooperation (BIMST-EC). A GOI delegation participated in the
BIMST-EC Preparatory Meeting for the Establishment of an
Economic Forum (8-9 November, 1999) and Trade and Investment
Sectoral Committee (10 November 1999) convened by the

Government of Bangladesh at Dhaka. The Economic Forum would
provide strategic leadership in initiating economic activities to benefit
the group, facilitate implementation of development projects, develop
mechanisms for greater private sector involvement in BIMST-EC
activities, enhance quality of information flows and promote
institutional linkages and networking, and generate increased
participation by the business community in the identified sectors of
BIMST-EC. India would be participating in the BIMST-EC meeting
of Experts in Energy Sector being convened by Myanmar on 28-29
February 2000.
The Sectoral Committee on Trade and Investment discussed the
critical role of information flows (on trade and investment matters)
within BIMST-EC member countries and the networking of private
sector agencies/institutions and investment promotion agencies of
member countries. India proposed setting up a BIMSTNet on the
Internet.
India also hosted a World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) Sub-Regional Forum on Intellectual Property Rights among
BIMST-EC Countries in New Delhi on 18-19 November 1999. In
order to give greater impetus to cooperation in this area, the meeting
proposed that it would be desirable to officially include Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) as a sub-sector of cooperation under the trade
and investment sector in BIMST-EC. The meeting stressed the critical
role which Information Technology could play in facilitating IPRrelated cooperation under BIMST-EC and stressed the need to
intensify linkages between IPR-related institutions in member
countries.
Besides participating in the deliberations of various regional
economic and multilateral groupings, the Ministry also associated itself
with various other international economic conferences and seminars.
A high-level Indian delegation led by EAM participated in the bilateral
95

Foreign Economic Relations

India-United Kingdom (UK) talks on International Economic and
Financial Issues held on 24 May 1999 in London. The talks provided
an opportunity to both the countries to review the present state of
UK and Indian economies, bilateral economic relations, and global
economic issues of significance.
EAM visited Paris to participate in a special dialogue between
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Council of Ministers and selected non-member countries, held at Paris
on 26 May 1999. Other non-member countries which were invited
were Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian
Federation, the Slovak Republic and South Africa. The meeting
provided an opportunity for the 29 member countries of OECD to
discuss policy coherence on a range of key economic issues, with
important non-member countries, representing a population of over
3 billion people and a rising share of the global GDP.
The Ministry played an active coordinating role in the Economic
and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Projects of
Trans Asian Railway and Asian Highway. A 4-member Indian
delegation comprising representatives of the Ministry of Railways,
the Ministry of External Affairs, and Container Corporation of India
(CONCOR) participated in the meeting for development of TransAsian Railway - Southern Corridor (TAR-SC), convened by ESCAP
in Dhaka on 25-28 May 1999.
In the context of South-South cooperation, a GOI delegation
participated in the 11th Session of High Level Committee (HLC) on
the Review of Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries
(TCDC), held at New York from 1-4 June 1999. The HLC mechanism,
which has been created by the UN General Assembly, pursuant to
the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) on TCDC in 1978, meets
every two years. Participation in the meeting provided an excellent
96

opportunity for reiterating Indias active involvement with the TCDC
cause. Indias statement was widely circulated within participant
countries along with other information booklets on the ITEC
programme. India announced the establishment of a specific Trust
Fund for beneficiaries in Africa, Latin America and South Pacific
countries.
Solidarity with Africa continues to be one of Indias main planks
of its multilateral economic relations diplomacy. Thus, India
participated in the Regional Review Meeting of the Tokyo Agenda
for Action - finalized at the Second Tokyo International Conference
on African Development (TICAD) at Tokyo in October 1998 - held
in Lusaka, Zambia from 23-25 November 1999. The Indian delegate
gave an overview of the initiatives being undertaken by India for the
economic development of Africa, both at a bilateral level under the
Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme,
and in other multilateral fora such as the G-15, Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Special Commonwealth African
Assistance Plan (SCAAP), Economic and Technical Cooperation
among Developing Countries (ECDC/TCDC), Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). During the
conference, India conveyed its willingness to partner with developed
countries like Japan for developmental initiatives in Africa on a case
by case basis. Under such triangular cooperation, Indian experts could
collaborate in development-oriented projects funded by developed
countries in select areas such as information technology, agriculture,
small-scale industries, public health and education. India also
highlighted the potential for strengthening some of the Indian
institutions and centres of excellence imparting HRD training in
various fields to African candidates through assistance by developed
countries.

used by the end of this financial year. The number of Training
Institutes has been increased to 51 after empanelling 12 new Institutes
in the current financial year in response to needs expressed by our
partner countries. The new Institutes cover fields such as Drugs and
Pharmaceuticals, Labour Administration and Employment Relations
in a global Economy, Hotel Management, Oceanography, Artificial
Insemination, Telecommunications, Sugarcane Production
Technology, Wildlife Management, Remote Sensing, etc. Regular
courses were conducted in the usual fields of Audit and Accounts,
Banking, Diplomacy, Manpower Planning, Parliamentary Studies,
Rural Development, Small Scale Industries, Information Technology,
Food Processing, Textile Technology, News Agency Journalism,
Standardisation, Educational Planning and Administration,
Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development, Packaging,
International Management, Human Resource Planning and English
Language. Under ITEC Civil Training Programme all costs including
international travel are borne by the GOI.

ITEC has created considerable goodwill for India and helped
boost her image as a country with indigenous technological skills and
capabilities who shares her knowledge and experience with other
developing countries without any strings attached. There has been a
growing demand for ITEC assistance from partner countries. From
actual expenditure of Rs. 22.69 crores in 1997-98, the programmes
budget grew to Rs. 34.29 crores in 1998-99. The budget allocation
for 1999-2000 has been enhanced to Rs. 36.00 crores.

For the first time in 1999-2000, neighbouring countries, Nepal,
Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Myanmar were allotted
slots under ITECs Civil Training Programme. Utilisation of these
slots is, however, uneven; while Sri Lanka and Maldives have utilised
the entire allocation, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar have not so
far been able to utilise the slots to the extent desired. We expect the
utilisation to improve as information about the offer percolates better
into the system next year.

In 1999-2000, 1967 slots were allotted for Civil training (as against
1485 in 1998-99) in prestigious Training Institutes and Establishments
(Annexure-XIII) including 240 slots allotted to 24 Pacific, CARICOM
and Central American States under a newly created window for
technical cooperation with these countries. Until now 1067 slots have
been utilised (Annexure-XIV and XV) and more are expected to be

Under Military Training, nominees of friendly countries are
imparted training in national institutions in all three wings of defence
services, including the prestigious National Defence College, New
Delhi and National Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. The
Training covers fields such as Security and Strategic Studies; Defence
Management; Artillery; Electronics, Mechanical, Marine and

Technical Cooperation
The Technical Cooperation Division offers technical assistance
under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC)
Programme and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan
(SCAAP) to 141 developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America,
Eastern Europe and the Pacific. For the purposes of this report,
reference to ITEC will also include SCAAP (under which only civil
training is provided) as the two programmes are different only in
budget heads under which accounts are maintained.
The ITEC assistance takes the following four forms:
i)

Training (both civil and military).

ii) Projects and project-related assistance such as supply of
equipment, consultancy services and feasibility studies.
iii) Deputation of experts and

Aeronautical Engineering; Anti-marine Warfare; Hydrographic;
Logistics and Management and Qualitative Assurance Services.
All Military training costs, including international travel, for
ITEC-I category candidates are met by GOI. For ITEC-II category
candidates, costs are partially covered under ITEC and partially
(international travel ) shared with the partner country. During 1999 2000, 195 slots for long and short term training courses were offered
under ITEC/SAP and 140 slots under Self-Financing Scheme. Some
slots were also offered on reciprocal basis. Annexures XVI- XIX
contain lists of beneficiary countries of ITEC Military Training
Programme.
Projects and project related assistance has helped enhance Indias
image as a modern economy and technologically and scientifically
advanced State. In 1999 - 2000, a project was launched to establish a
Plastic Technology Demonstration and Common Facility Centre in
the backward area of Ondangwa (located about 800 kms. from
Windhoek) in Namibia at a total cost of approximately Rs. 3.40 crores.
NSIC is the Implementing Agency for this project. The Centre will
provide vocational skills to the youth of Namibia and enhance
employment opportunities for them. Another project costing
approximately Rs.13 crores for setting up an Entrepreneurship and
Technical Development Centre (ETDC) in Senegal, started in 1998
by HMT(I), is expected to be completed in January/February, 2000.
Envisaged in the long run as a Regional Centre for all the French
speaking West African countries, ETDC provides vocational training
to 96 students in selected mechanical and electronic trades. After a
midterm review of the project was conducted by Additional Secretary
(FA) and Joint Secretary (TC), the Ministry of National Education,
Government of Senegal decided to confer National Diploma to each
student passing out from the Centre which will be recognised not
only in Senegal but also in other franco-phone countries in West
Africa.
98

The Indian Farmers Project in Burkina Faso aimed at transferring
Indian Green Revolution technology, particularly in rice cultivation
to Burkina Faso was also launched this year. This is a unique project
under which six practical farmers from Punjab have been sent to
Burkina Faso for three years to implement the project. Farm
machinery, equipment and other inputs have also been supplied by
the GOI. In fulfilment of a high-level commitment, equipment for
setting up five primary health centres was also supplied this year to
Burkina Faso. In Mongolia, where ITEC had set up the Rajiv Gandhi
Vocational Training Centre (RGVTC) in September 1996, two
additional faculties i.e. Computer Programming and Gem Stone
Cutting and Polishing were provided this year, to augment the existing
five faculties (auto mechanic, radio and TV repair, plumbing, electrician
and machine shop mechanics). These two additional faculties were
inaugurated by the Honble Vice President of India during his visit to
Mongolia in August 1999. Smaller projects, feasibility studies and
consultancy services were undertaken in countries such as Myanmar,
Kyrghyzstan, Guyana, Cambodia and Fiji. A list of projects and
project-related assistance extended this year so far to different
countries may be seen at Annexure XX.
Under the much sought after Study Visits Programme, senior
decision makers from various partner countries are invited to India
for exchange of views and guided exposure to Indian capacities in
fields of interest to them such as small scale industries, agriculture,
health, education, foreign-trade, etc. Twenty study visits were planned
this year as against 10-11 in previous years. Manpower constraints in
TC Division were overcome by engaging the services of retired Deputy
Secretary / Director level officers of the Ministry to act as Liaison
Officers for the visiting delegations. A 2-member delegation led by
Mr. Yura Jigj, Director, Rajiv Gandhi Vocational Training Centre
(RGVTC), Ulaanbaatar, visited India from 19 - 25 June, 1999 to see
Computer Programming and Gem & Jewellery Processing facilities

Annual Report 1999-2000

in India and to discuss with the officials in the Ministry of Education
the possibilities of cooperation in the education field. A 2-member
team from Suriname led by Mr. S F Polanen, Chairman of the Electoral
Council of Suriname, visited India from 18 - 23 September, 1999 to
study Indias electoral process. Dr. Haseeb Bashi, Director General,
Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, visited
India from October 25 - 29, 1999 to select books in engineering,
technology, science, etc. which are proposed to be supplied to Iraq
under ITEC Programme. A 3-member delegation from Turkmenistan
led by H.E. Mr. N U Utamyshev, Deputy Minister of Textiles, visited
India from November 14 - 21, 1999 to study and discuss possible
cooperation in textile industry. Mr. M. Y. C. Lumbanga, Chief Secretary
of Tanzania visited India from December 14-20, 1999 to study the
industrial and technological progress made by India. Other study visits
are scheduled this year from Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Uganda and
Seychelles.
Indian experts are deputed abroad as advisors in response to
requests received from Governments of developing countries for
advice on technical and developmental subjects such as health,
agriculture, engineering, teaching, accounts, small scale industries and
legislation drafting. Over the years Indian experts have effected
incremental improvement in vital developmental sectors of the
economies of many countries with their well considered advice which
is generally respected for being most relevant to the needs and
capacities of the developing economies. Expenses on deputing experts
are shared with the host country although the larger share is borne
by the GOI. The number of experts until 1998-99 was 23 but there

are plans to raise this number to 50 to meet the growing demand.
Through the valuable cooperation and support of the Department
of Personnel and Training, we have been able to reduce our response
time taken to send an expert abroad. At present there are 22 long
term and 1 short term experts (Annexure XXI) in Guyana, Laos,
Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, Trinidad & Tobago, Vietnam, Zambia
and Zanzibar.
In May, 1999 a documentary video film on ITEC Programme
entitled, The South Imperatives of Cooperation was prepared and
shown at New York during the 11th Session of High Level Committee
on TCDC held from June 1-5, 1999. Copies of the video film were
also sent to Indian Missions for use on ITEC Day on 15th September,
1999. The film was well received. In some countries the film was
shown on local TV network.
Under the Aid for Disaster Relief (ADR) Programme
humanitarian assistance for victims of natural disasters in various
countries is provided in the form of medicines, food items, tents,
blankets etc. Under this programme 92 MT of sugar and 500 MT of
rice were supplied to Indonesia/ West Timor while medicines and
surgical items were supplied to Madagascar, Mozambique, Ghana and
Honduras for the victims of a cholera epidemic and floods. Tents
were supplied to Tajikistan in the wake of unseasonal torrential rains
and tea, surgical items and medicines were supplied to Turkey for the
victims of earthquake. The list containing the details of the relief
supplies is at Annexure XXII.

Trade and Investment Promotion

T

he Central Government and the State Governments took
several initiatives and measures during the year aimed at
encouraging foreign investment inflows, particularly the flow
of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India. The major thrust
areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power,
telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment
Promotion and Publicity Division to actively undertake effective
investment promotion and publicity efforts, particularly through the
Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment
into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missions are
the first point of contact for the foreign investor. It is, therefore,
essential that the Missions are given full backup support in their efforts
in the form of providing up-to-date information about the economy,
the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and
opportunities available in different sectors, the incentives offered by
the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions
are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of
delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of
other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these
and related matters the Investment Promotion and Publicity (IPP)
Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and
coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication
100

between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments
or other agencies, as the case may be.
Policy
The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever
required, based on investment trends worldwide and based on the
need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and our
economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the Missions
on foreign investor perceptions about Indias investment policies or
about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving as
inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an
existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national
interest.
The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and Foreign Investment
Implementation Authority (FIIA) in collaboration with other
Ministries and State Governments. In FIPB, the Ministry was
represented by Secretary (ER) and investments from NRIs were given
particular attention. In FIAA, specific policy measures to speed up
the investment already made were taken up with concerned Ministries
and State Governments.

Annual Report 1999-2000

Promotional Efforts and Initiatives
The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably
projecting the various investment policies and announcements of the
Government by coordinating with the Missions on the one hand and
various economic Ministries of the Central Government and State
Governments on the other. Economic news about India was regularly
disseminated to all the Missions highlighting major policy decisions
and new opportunities, thus keeping them abreast of the
developments. Missions were also encouraged to hold investment
promotion seminars and workshops besides extending investment
support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points
etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of
our Missions in identified target countries. The Ministry also
undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures and
opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.
The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations
including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging
suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials
and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations.
The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by
the Missions, visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having
appropriate meetings with concerned Government Departments, the
Apex Chambers of Commerce, the State Governments etc. The
Ministry also participated in many bilateral or other meetings/
conferences involving overseas investor groups.
The Ministry also actively assisted various Departments/
organisations in the country in organising investment/trade
promotion events in India, including the Ministerial Conference on
Space Applications for Sustainable Development in Asia and Pacific
organised by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission

for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in New Delhi from 15-20 November
1999 and hosted by the Government of India. This Division liaised
with our Missions/Posts abroad for participation of the ESCAP
member countries in the above Conference. Indian and French space
agencies have joined hands to launch a scientific satellite, Megha
Tropiques, which will provide data on atmospheric and oceanic
activities to scientists across the world.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the French
space agency Centre National dEtudes Spatiales (CNES) signed a
statement of intent in New Delhi to launch the satellite in an effort
to understand weather and climate better.
The Government launched a comprehensive scheme for the
persons of Indian origin - called PIO Card Scheme on 30th March.
Under this scheme persons of Indian origin upto the fourth generation
(great grand parents settled through out the world except citizens of
Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries as may be specified by the
Central Government from time to time), would be eligible. The Card
would be issued to eligible applicants through concerned Indian
Embassies/High Commissions/Consulates and for those staying in
India on long-term visa (more than one year), the concerned
Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta,
Chennai) would do the same. The fee for the Card which will have
validity of 20 years, would be US$ 1000. The Ministry actively
participated in the efforts to mobilise good response for the PIO
Card.
Publicity
The IPP Division has reprinted 10,000 copies of its brochure
India Means Business - Perspectives in view of the positive response
received from investors in India and abroad. The Division is also
bringing out the French, German and Spanish versions of this
brochure.
101

Trade and Investment Promotion

The Division is planning to set up a specialised web site on the
internet aimed at foreign business community. It will carry up-todate information on policies and procedures for investment in India,
economic reforms including second generation reforms, economic
data covering investment trends, success stories, interactive section
for business queries and specific projects on offer, etc.
Agreements
The Ministry participated in the negotiations for drawing up of
Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs)

and Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) that were held
in respect of a number of countries. Such agreements were signed
during the year with New Zealand, Trinidad & Tobago, Kyrgyzstan,
Qatar, Indonesia and Zimbabwe.
The Ministry also participated in the negotiations relating to
bilateral Civil Aviation matters with other countries. The Ministry
provided legal inputs, as required, and also tendered advice based on
the need for increased civil aviation links particularly with our
neighbouring regions to evolve in consonance with the initiatives being
taken on the foreign policy front.

Policy Planning and Research

T

he Policy Planning and Research Division of the Ministry
continued to perform its role of preparing briefs and
background papers on important topics and issues on the
evolving international situation. These covered issues of long-term
relevance to broad foreign policy objectives. The Division prepared
analytical position papers for Ministrys interaction with other agencies.
An in-depth paper on Euro prepared in the Division was circulated
in the Ministry and Missions abroad.
The Division continued to serve as a nodal point for interaction
with the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) formerly known
as the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the University Grants
Commission (UGC) and its affiliates and the Area Study Centres
(ASC) located in various universities and specializing in research on
various regions of the world.
The Division extended financial, assistance to various academic
institutions/think tanks located in different parts of the country for
holding conferences, seminars, preparation of research papers,
exchange of scholars and support for Track-II programmes on issues
related to Indias external relations and security.
The subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects
covered Indian Foreign Policy, India-Iran Relations, India-Korea

Dialogue, Indo-US Dialogue, Contribution of Persons of Indian
Origin (PIOs) in the development of countries of their-adoption,
Conference on South Asia, Regional Cooperation among SAARC
Countries. Support was also provided to Indian scholars and experts
attending seminars and conferences in Turkey, Sri Lanka. Singapore,
Kyrghystan, Tajikistan, USA, UK and Canada.
The Centre for Advanced Study of India at the University of
Pennsylvania, USA is given an annual recurring grant by the Division.
A proposal for giving another grant is currently under examination
as a part of the continuing Indo-US cooperation in various fields.
The Division took initiative in promoting exchanges with official
and non-official visiting experts and projected Indias views and
perceptions on important issues. In continuation of this interactive
role, Joint Secretary (PP) led a delegation to Tehran, Iran or the First
Meeting of the Working Group on Research and Study between Iran
and India. During the meeting held on 7th and 8th December 1999
in Tehran, the two sides underlined the importance of research and
study in increasing bilateral cooperation and better understanding of
regional and international issues of mutual interest. It was agreed at
the meeting that:
a) research and study should be carried out on subjects which have
103

Policy Planning and Research

an immediate and direct impact on bilateral relations or issues of
common interest to both countries and
b) experts and scholars from outside the Foreign Ministries should
be engaged in research and study. Apart from holding discussions
on various political issues, science and technology issues were
also discussed under which it was agreed that a dialogue between
the scientific organizations and experts of both countries should
be held at the earliest convenience of both sides to identify specific
areas for cooperation and joint research. Economic and
commercial issues were also discussed wherein it was agreed to
undertake studies on economic complementarities, strengths in
specific sectors, obstacles to trade and economic cooperation
and greater rise of transit routes available under existing
arrangements. During the visit, the Indian delegation also called
on the Deputy Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr. Sadeq Kharrazi and
Deputy Minister for Technology, H.E. Dr. Sayed Ahmad
Motamedi. In view of the fruitful discussions at the First Meeting,
it was agreed that further meetings would be held alternatively in
New Delhi and Tehran at mutually convenient dates.
To further strengthen Ministrys capabilities in research and
analyses, the Division prepared a detailed proposal for revival of the
Research Cadre as recommended by the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on External Affairs. The proposal and Cabinet Note are
in the last stages of being processed and with the revival of this vital
Cadre, it is hoped that our research and analytical capabilities will be
further strengthened to face challenges in formulating our foreign
policy.
The Ambassadors-in-Residence Programme was also revived
with the posting of two Ambassadors  one specializing in Gulf
Studies and the other in Euro-Atlantic Studies. Both Ambassadors
are now attached to the School of International Studies, Jawaharlal
104

Nehru University, New Delhi. Agreements have also been obtained
from the universities of Mumbai, Goa and Delhi for posting of such
Ambassadors-in-Residence and volunteers having the required
qualifications and experiences are awaited for filling tip these posts.
The Division continued to edit and publish the Annual Report
of the Ministry. The Report served as a compendium of Indias
interaction with the rest of the world in the political, economic and
cultural fields, including the views of the government on various facets
of international relations.
The Division rendered all possible assistance to the terrorism
divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific
information or document on international relations was required. The
Research Wing examined the depiction of Indias international
boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were
taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through
Indian Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The
Division also scrutinized foreign publications containing maps
depicting Indias external boundaries before these were imported into
the county and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such
matters. It coordinated the supply of map-sheets to various
Government and semi-Government agencies for use in their official
work with the Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The
Research Wing dealt with requests from research scholars for access
to the records of the Ministry. A Committee has been constituted
with representatives from the Ministries of External Affairs, Home
Affairs and Defence to examine the access of Research Scholars to
Pre-Independence closed period records in the National Archives
of India.
In support of research, the Ministrys Library has modern
information technology equipment and rich resource materials, with
over one hundred thousand books and a large collection of maps,

Annual Report 1999-2000

microfilms and official documents. The Library receives and maintains
600 periodical titles. It has in-house computer systems with fifteen
terminals, two of which support data entry and retrieval in Hindi. It
also has CD-ROM work station and has CD-ROM databases on
foreign affairs and current affairs. The Library is also equipped with
a CD-writer, a Colour Scanner (with OCR capability as well as facility
for storage and retrieval of images), a microfilm/fiche reader printer,
a plain paper photocopier, as well as a VTR and colour monitor and
a laser printer with Desk Top Publishing (DTP) software. This has
enabled better presentation of publications and documents of the
Division. The Library has internet and E-mail facilities. These are
being gradually made available to visiting users who including former
Foreign Service officers, Documentation/bibliographic services as
well as other library operations and services have been computerised,
using an integrated library software package. Information on all books,
maps, documents and selected periodical articles received in the
Library since 1986, and pre-1986 publications in active use, are
available on-line through each terminal in the as well as in the Ministrys
headquarters in South Block and in Akbar Bhawan through network
in operation in these buildings. Librarys information databases can
also be accessed on internet on MEA Library's websites by eligible
users including our officials in Missions abroad. All new documents
received in the Library  books, maps, microfilms, selected articles
from periodicals  are being fed into the in-house computer system
to create a database on foreign affairs.

Using this database and CD-ROM Databases, the Library
provides Current Awareness Service and Bibliographical and
Reference Services. In addition, the Library regularly issues Foreign
Affairs Documentation Bulletin  monthly list of selected periodicals,

External Publicity

A

s an instrument of foreign policy management, the External
Publicity Division discharges several key functions, namely:
responding to the citizens right to information; articulating
the policies and responses of the government on foreign policy and
international security affairs; projecting a holistic and correct image
of the country; playing the role of a catalyst for enhancing contacts
between Indian media and their counterparts in foreign countries;
dissemination of published information through Indian libraries
abroad; maintaining an internet website with a comprehensive database
and daily updates; and publishing an in-house monthly India
Perspectives in ten languages for wide circulation abroad. A special
responsibility was placed on the XP Division in the summer of 1999
to organise and anchor the inter-ministerial daily briefings to the
national and international media on political and military developments
following Pakistans aggression against India in the Kargil sector of
Jammu and Kashmir. These briefings helped galvanise international
public opinion in support of Indias message that aggression against
India would have to be reversed by Pakistan and that the sanctity and
inviolability of the Line of Control in the Indian State of Jammu and
Kashmir must be respected.
The official spokesman articulated and projected Indias position
on various national and international issues through official

106

statements, press briefings and public relations efforts. Over 200
official statements and press releases were issued by the XP Division
during the period 1999-2000 and circulated to Indian media, foreign
media resident in India, foreign missions in New Delhi and made
available on the ministrys internet website.
The Foreign Affairs Record, a compilation of all press releases,
agreements, speeches and significant diplomatic developments, was
brought out on a monthly basis. Our news dissemination function
also includes daily news bulletins and clippings for headquarters and
missions and posts abroad; regular feedback to missions and posts
on developments concerning India. MEAs internet website serves as
a vital tool in the overall effort towards information dissemination.
Efforts were made jointly with Indian missions and posts abroad
to enlarge areas of positive perception about India. Some focus areas
included: Indias foreign policy and international security approach;
Indias millennial history and civilization; its diverse and profound
religious and philosophical traditions; its democratic and secular
political culture and institutions, its pluralistic, tolerant and progressive
social ethos; its wide experience in nation building; its impressive
economic, scientific and technological achievements and its market
potential.

Annual Report 1999-2000

Audio visual publicity : Documentary and feature films were
used to reinforce the countrys positive image. In the year 1999-2000,
several documentaries on a variety of themes were completed while
others are under various stages of production. These include City
Scapes, Foreigners Who have Adopted India as their Home, Heart of
the Matter (foreign policy show), India & the UN, Wisdom of India,
SAARC in the Next Millennium, Software Frontiers and Coronation
of the King of Bhutan.
Documentary films were circulated for non-commercial publicity
through Indian missions and posts abroad. These include India in
Space, Adoor  A Journey in Frames, Bamboo Flute, Indian Nobel
Laureates, Rooted Imagination, Women in Panchayats, Design Classics
of India, Healing Tree, Heart of the Matter, Echoes from the Past
(Old Monuments of Delhi), Unheard Melodies, Fragrance of Love,
Nisbat, Of Melodies Divine, and Abiding Grace. On the occasion of
Indias Independence Day  1999, several documentaries were sent
abroad for telecast on local TV networks and international channels.
A positive feedback was received from Indian missions and posts on
these telecasts.
A CD-ROM titled India-Timeless Civilization....Vibrant
Democracy, was brought out by the ministry and its English version
was sent to all missions and posts abroad. The Hindi, Arabic and
Chinese versions are in the final stages of completion, while the
Russian, Spanish and French language versions are also expected to
be completed in the near future. A major exercise was undertaken to
procure and distribute audio and video CDs, representative of the
best of Indian music and cinema, for reference and information.
Film festivals were organized by various missions and posts
abroad and foreign cultural centres in coordination with the ministry.
11 international film festivals, including retrospectives on Ritwik

Ghatak and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, were organized in Paris, Madrid,
Hanoi, Damascus, Glasgow, Cairo, Rome, Copenhagen, Kuala
Lumpur, Mexico City. 49 prints of feature films were supplied from
the XP audio-visual library and other prints were procured from
Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF) and other agencies for this
purpose. Assistance was also provided in facilitating foreign
participation in the 31st International Film Festival in Delhi in January
2000. The division also extended its support in the arrangement of
slide shows and photo-exhibitions in missions and posts abroad.
Requests for information infrastructure and audio-video hardware
from missions and posts were processed. These included sanctioning
of equipment such as satellite antenna, TVs, VCRs, projectors and
photocopiers.
Press facilitation: Foreign media, both print and electronic,
continued to evince keen interest in India through sustained visits.
Indias foreign policy and its approach to security issues, the general
elections and Pakistans aggression in Kargil further stimulated the
medias interest in India. Various facilities were extended by the
Ministry to meet the increased inflow of media persons.
During the year, about 100 journalists, individually or as part of
media and TV delegations visited India from Australia, Austria,
Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Gaza,
Indonesia, Israel, Iran, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia,
South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Turkey and Venezuela. These visits
led to a balanced coverage of India in foreign media, as well as to a
better understanding of the country. Many journalistic visits were
unstructured and spontaneous. The division provided assistance to
them, including arranging meetings with senior ministers, high-level
government officials, academicians, representatives of business houses,
industry, etc.
107

External Publicity

Another important aspect of press facilitation work handled by
the division was to provide assistance to foreign media accompanying
Heads of State or Government on visits to India, including those
from Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Estonia, Kazakhsthan,
Kyrghyz Republic, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Qatar,
Russia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Uruguay, Vatican
and Vietnam. The assistance rendered entailed facilitating media
coverage, arranging press briefings and providing other logistical
arrangements. Over 200 journalists, both Indian and foreign, covered
Prime Ministers historic visit to Lahore in February 1999. Another
large media event was the visit by H.H. Pope John Paul II to India in
November 1999.
All logistical arrangements were made for coverage by the Indian
media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and Prime
Minister on their state visits abroad to Jamaica (G-15), Trinidad and
Tobago, Morocco, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mongolia, Kyrghyz Republic,
Austria, Tanzania and South Africa. This included the setting up and
operation of media centres, media briefings and other facilities and
logistical arrangements. Assistance was also provided to Indian
journalists travelling abroad on specific assignments.
The making of documentary films by foreign TV channels was
encouraged and facilitated through timely clearance and administrative
assistance. Around 300 proposals were received from documentary
makers all over the world relating to diverse aspects of India including
tourism, wildlife, social and cultural issues, travelogues etc. Over 90
per cent of these proposals were cleared, while others are at various
stages of clearances awaiting requisite approvals of other central and
state government departments.
Supply of print material : The division continued to procure
and supply books, magazines, journals and other periodicals for use
in the libraries of and for distribution to local dignitaries, opinion
108

makers and academic institutions abroad. 77 titles of books were
purchased and distributed to all Indian missions and posts abroad.
Booklets on Prime Ministers speeches at 9th G-15 Summit, brochures
on India and UN (in English and French); Indias role in UN peacekeeping; biographies of Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers;
and India at a Glance (in Portuguese) were some of the projects taken
up for implementation. Quarterly compilation of press releases and
Spokesmans statements were printed regularly.
Infrastructure : Major renovation and restructuring work,
including the construction of a new state-of-the-art auditorium, an
audio-visual library and a waiting room for visitors is under
implementation.
MEA website : The ministrys website was kept updated on a
daily basis to cover all developments relating to foreign policy, nuclear
issues, international terrorism, speeches and interviews of dignitaries,
official spokesmans statements, bilateral treaties and agreements
signed by India, Indias political and economic developments, general
elections, Parliament questions and answers etc. During the Kargil
conflict, a special section was launched which included daily updates
by the Armed Forces, statements by the ministry and international
and Indian press coverage of the conflict. The website server was
also upgraded to incorporate audio-visual contents and a greater
volume of textual material. The website received an average of 2.2
million hits per month and was widely appraised and appreciated by
the users. The website was also hyper-linked by some of the important
organizations like CNN, The Economist, etc. for information relating
to India. An e-mail-based media reporting system for feedback from
abroad on the local reporting and for retrievable storage of this
reporting was started with selected missions abroad. Extensive archival
material on Indias foreign policy is being loaded on the website for
reference and easy retrieval.

Annual Report 1999-2000

India Perspectives, the monthly magazine of the ministry was
published every month in ten different languages for distribution
through Indian missions and posts abroad. Demand for the
publication has been ever-increasing and 55,000 copies were printed
during the year for supply to Indian missions and posts. Besides
highlighting Indias historical and cultural heritage, the journal has
been focussing on the impressive progress made by India in the fields

of science and technology and the steps taken to globalize the countrys
economy. Two special issues of the magazine were brought out in
March 1999 to mark the Prime Ministers historic visit to Lahore and
to commemorate the celebration of the tricentenary of the
establishment of the Khalsa Panth Special Millennium issues, which
would carry articles of abiding interest on all facets of India are being

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

T

he Passports for Indian nationals, visa for foreign nationals
and Consular services encompass the activity in which the
Ministry of External Affairs and its subsidiary organisation
Central Passport Organisation  (CPO) serve the public directly. In
this era of increased foreign travel and globalisation the issue of a
passport empowers the individual to become a global citizen. Through
its activities the Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division facilitates
the export of Indian manpower, expertise and technology abroad.
The growing number of Non-Resident Indians and the People of
Indian Origin abroad constitute a vital and vibrant link between India
and the rest of the world. In the Nineties as the international scene
has witnessed momentous changes, the people of Indian Origin
abroad have matured politically, prospered economically and have
developed socially nurturing their roots and simultaneously integrating
fully with the societies of their countries of adoption. In the new
millennium communities of people of Indian Origin are well poised
to play a significant role in promoting Indias interests and in
contributing towards the strengthening of Indias political and
economic relations with their respective countries of residence.
Passport Services
The CPO was imbued with a new dynamism and concerted efforts

were made to fulfil the Governments commitments under the
Citizens Charter through various innovative measures aimed at
providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport
Offices. Two new Passport Collection Centres were opened at
Vijaywada and Mangalore during the year. The Passport Rules were
amended to allow for printing, distribution and sale at a nominal
price of passport application forms for convenience of the passport
applicants.
A website was launched which carries all the rules, regulations
etc. for passport, visa and PIO Cards and allows all kinds of
applications forms to be downloaded.
Concerted efforts were made to reduce the pendency of
applications in various Passport Offices for which procedures were
streamlined. A Pendency Clearance Week was declared in the last
week of July and November and December were declared as Pendency
Clearance Months. Annual Passport Officers Conference was held
on 9-10 November 1999 at which emphasis was placed on reforming
and revamping the procedures to make the system more productive
and efficient. There was special emphasis on the redressal of public
grievances and the practice of periodical Passport Adalats was
initiated at eleven Passport Offices.
115

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

Several measures were initiated to simplify and streamline various
procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous
services promptly and efficiently in keeping with the commitment
under the Citizen Charter. The Police verification system was
comprehensively revised to make it more responsive to public demand.
To meet the public demand a Tatkaal Scheme for out of turn
issue of passports was launched. The fee for this scheme was set at a
higher level to meet the extra costs involved in interruption of the
normal chain and sequence of work in the issue of an out of turn
passport.
At most Passport Offices concrete measures were taken to
enhance the level of comfort to the applicants/visitors by increasing
the number of public counters, augmenting air-conditioning,
installation of water coolers, provision of chairs etc.
The computerisation of Passport Offices continued and four
more Passport Offices were computerised taking the total of
computerised Passport Office to 19. Other Passport Offices are also
in the process of being computerised. A proposal for a comprehensive
satellite based computerised networking and connectivity as well as
creation of a Central Processing Cell has been formulated. The process
of tenders for comprehensive computerisation of all Passport Offices
has been initiated to take advantage of the latest available technology.
Separately machine writing of passports is being started on an
experimental basis in the Delhi Passport Office.
It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house
the Passport Office in Government owned properties. At present
Passport Offices buildings at four places (Mumbai, Cochin, Kozhikode
and Hyderabad) are owned by MEA, at five places are owned by the
Central Government/State Government and are rented in 19 places.
The Passport Office at Hyderabad was shifted to a new building owned
116

by MEA during the year. MEA has acquired plots of land/built-up
properties in various cities in India and construction work is in
progress at five places viz. Ahmedabad for office and residential
complex, Cochin (residential complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji
and Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for purchase of
land and construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been
initiated at seven other places i.e. Bangalore, Lucknow, Jaipur,
Thiruvanathapuram, Chandigarh, Tiruchirappalli, Jammu and
Calcutta. In Chennai space in an office complex has been purchased
and possession would be taken over in a few months.
The number of applications received during the year for grant of
passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of
name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. continued
to rise in keeping with the overall climate of liberalization and increased
travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 25.78 lakh passports
were issued and 24.30 lakh miscellaneous services were rendered.
During the year 1999, detailed figures of passports issued/ services
rendered, including the revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices
are at Appendix-IV
A conscious beginning was made to introduce modern
management practices in the passport issue system. Services of a
private consultancy firm and a management expert were mobilized
for a management and process study of Regional Passport Officer,
Delhi.
PIO Cards
The six million Indian Citizens and over twenty million People
of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have collectively evolved into
a major instrument for the furtherance of Indias foreign policy.
Recognising their significant role in the shaping of the countrys
destiny, Government launched the PIO Card Scheme for Persons of

Annual Report 1999-2000

Indian Origin, settled in countries specified by the Government, which
has, besides introducing a visa free regime, also conferred some special
economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits. All preparations,
were completed in time for the issue of PIO Cards from Missions
and Posts abroad.
Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad were sensitised to the consular
needs of Overseas Indians and to render them efficient and timely
assistance on all days and at all hours. Problems encountered by NonResident Indians/workers especially in the Gulf countries, including
disputes with their employers/sponsors were sought to be promptly
redressed. Government maintained contacts with the Governments
of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism
of the Joint Commissions, with the objective of resolving consular
problems and ameliorating the conditions of Indian workers in those
countries. In cases of deaths of Indians abroad, assistance continued
to be arranged by our Missions and Posts for completing the
formalities for early dispatch of the mortal remains, maintaining liaison
with the local and Indian authorities and keeping the relatives of the
deceased informed.
During the year, 8945 Indians were arrested abroad and 3589
deaths of Indian abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary
of the consular data for the year 1999 is at Appendix-V
Visas
Indias 157 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to
over a million foreigners in the period 1 January to 30 September
1999. Over the years the procedure for grant of visa by our Missions
and Posts has been streamlined. Many Missions and Posts give visas
either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas
within 48 hours.

The Consular Wing at CGI, Birmingham was computerised
during the year. It is proposed to computerise the Consular Wings of
our Missions and Posts in the Gulf, West Europe and North America.
A number of software companies have been short-listed and the
process of evaluation of their technical proposals and commercial
offers is at an advanced stage. First those Missions and Posts would
be computerised where the volume of services rendered is high.
Bilateral Agreements
As part of the global endeavour to combat organized crime,
international terrorism and drug trafficking, and acknowledging the
growing international dimensions of financial and other crimes,
consular agreements are being negotiated with several countries to
provide legal and institutional framework. These consular agreements
include Extradition Treaties, Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance
in Criminal Matters, Agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil
Matters and Consular Conventions.
During the visit of Kazakh Foreign Minister to India in October,
1999 an Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
was signed. In November 1999, an Extradition Treaty, an Agreement
on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and an Agreement
on Juridical and Judicial Cooperation in Civil and Commercial matters
were signed during the visit of the Minister of Justice and Aukaf of
the UAE. The Extradition Treaty signed with the USA in June 1997
was ratified and instruments of ratification were exchanged in July
1999. During the year, official and technical level consultations were
held with Tunisia, Oman, Poland and Mongolia and Extradition
Treaties were initialed with all these countries. An Agreement on
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and an Agreement on
Mutual Legal assistance in Civil Matters were also initialed with
Mongolia.
117

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

The Ministry is actively pursuing requests for extradition and
other legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal
and civil and commercial charges. The requests for extradition emanate
from our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or Extradition
Arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year
16 requests for extradition and 68 requests for legal assistance were
received in addition to the ongoing cases.
During the year, 2,47,731 documents were accorded consular
attestation in CPV Division of which 1,55,645 were commercial
documents. This service is rendered on the same day, is without any
charge and is prompt and efficient.
Renovation of Patiala House
The CPV Division located in Patiala House, visited by a large
number of persons who come for attestation of documents as well as
by diplomats and staff of foreign Missions in New Delhi. Over the
years the building had become dilapidated and shabby in appearance.
Comprehensive renovation of the exterior as well as interior of the
building was undertaken and completed during the year.
Central Passport Organisation
The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) man

118

the 28 Passport Offices and 15 existing Passport Collection Centres.
The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1690 with 173 Officers and
1517 non-gazetted staff. One of the major demands of the employees
has been for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at
various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review-cum-Creation of Posts
was partially approved by the Ministry of Finance in June 1999. A
fresh proposal has been prepared for Cadre Review to enhance the
number of officials to deal with public grievances and to streamline
the supervisory system.
As the volume of work as well as the network of Passport Offices
and Passport Collection Centres has been growing over the years, the
Ministry is considering a proposal to create a Central Passport
Authority with a view to grant greater autonomy to Passport Offices
to achieve greater efficiency and higher productivity.
Vision
The Consular, Passport and Visa work constitutes an important
public service. The public rightly expects prompt and courteous
service with minimal delays. The mission of the Ministry is to meet
the public expectations and provide a level of satisfaction of which it
can be proud.

Indias Neighbours

Section 1
Afghanistan

I

ndia remained deeply concerned with the situation in
Afghanistan, which directly impacts on our national interests,
including our security concerns. The ebb and flow of the civil
conflict between the Taliban which was supported and encouraged
by Pakistan and the Government of President Rabbani, which we
recognise as the legitimate government of Afghanistan was closely
monitored by us. The continuation of the civil war principally on
account of the intransigence of the Taliban and its foreign mentor,
Pakistan, continued to bring great suffering for a people with whom
we have historical ties of friendship and cooperation.
The Taliban launched three major campaigns against the forces
of the Government of Afghanistan, especially those of Commander
Ahmad Shah Masood. These campaigns sought to drive Masood
out of Afghanistan. However, Ahmad Shah Masood was able to hold
his ground in the Shumali plains as well as north of the Hindukush.
During these operations, the Taliban targetted the civilian population,
displacing women and children and destroying infrastructure. Such
activities can only be completely condemned.
The Taliban controlled areas in Afghanistan emerged as the
breeding ground for terrorists and extremist groups and the largest

source of opium production and illegal flow of narcotics in the world,
posing a serious threat to the peace and stability of the whole region.
For return to peace, normalcy and stable government in Afghanistan
which would also help in eliminating these negatives emanating from
Afghanistan, it was essential that foreign interference, principally from
Afghanistans southern borders must cease. India remained firm in
its belief that there can be no military solution to the Afghan problem
and that Afghanistans independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity must be preserved.
India kept in close touch with many countries that have influence
and interest in Afghan affairs. It supported the efforts of the UN to
bring peace to Afghanistan. However, it was our feeling that the 6+2
format relied upon by the UN as the principal mechanism to bring
peace to Afghanistan is inherently flawed on account of its narrow
and constricted base.
Notwithstanding our lack of recognition of the Taliban, our
strong reservations about its obscurantist ideologies and our
opposition to the manner in which it has permitted itself to be
manipulated by Pakistan, we established direct contact with the
Taliban during the hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814. The
role played by the Taliban during this crisis was noted but we made it
clear that the fundamentals of our Afghan policy would not change.
1

India's Neighbours

As in previous years, India continued to send humanitarian
assistance to Afghanistan both bilaterally and through the UN. To
ameliorate the suffering of thousands of Afghan people displaced
from the Shumali plains and Takhar province, 1000 tents, 25,500
blankets, 140 tonnes of food items and 15 tonnes of medicines, medical
supplies and medical equipment were despatched by eight chartered
flights. More consignments of medicines, shelter material and food
items will be sent in the coming months.
Iran

Indias multifaceted relations with Iran continued to grow. As a
part of continuing high-level interaction between the two countries,
Minister of External Affairs had a fruitful meeting with Dr. Seyed
Kamal Kharrazi, Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran at
New York on 23 September, 1999 during which all bilateral, regional
and international issues of mutual interest were discussed. Foreign
Secretary Shri K. Raghunath paid a visit to Tehran from 31 July-1
August, 1999 to review with his counterpart all bilateral, political,
commercial, economic, technical, cultural and consular cooperation.
He also exchanged views on regional matters and international issues
of common concern.
It was decided that for a more regular and structured consultations
between the Foreign Ministries of the two countries, four Working
Groups be formed for a more focussed attention on (i) Bilateral,
Political and Economic issues; (ii) International & Multilateral Issues;
(iii) Research & Sectoral Studies; and (iv) Cultural Cooperation.

Annual Report 1999-2000

was vacated. This was a fact that was well understood by the
international community.
The Indian armed forces began Operation Vijay on 26 May 1999
with the objective of completely evicting Pakistans armed intrusion
and aggression. While the Operation was on, the External Affairs
Minister also received the Foreign Minister of Pakistan for talks in
New Delhi (12 June 99). The Pakistan Foreign Minister was told
clearly that Pakistans armed intrusion and aggression was completely
unacceptable, that it constituted a blatant violation of the Line of
Control and the Simla Agreement and that there was no question of
any talks on this issue without Pakistan first addressing itself to
vacating its aggression against India and restoring status quo ante on
the LOC. Indias outrage at the inhuman and barbaric treatment meted
out to our soldiers in Pakistani custody was also conveyed to him. We
demanded that those guilty of these atrocities be brought to justice.
The Pakistan Foreign Minister was also told that Pakistans aggression
was a grave breach of trust and while its territorial aggression against
India would be evicted, it would be extremely difficult to restore the
trust and confidence that had been damaged by Pakistans betrayal.

approbation. It also needs to be emphasised that the importance of
the inviolability and sanctity of the LOC for maintaining peace and
tranquillity was totally accepted by the international community.
Pakistan was held as having violated this line and its efforts at terming
it as imprecise also failed. The international community also concurred
with our assertion that Kargil was a manifestation of the medieval
malevolence spilling over from Afghanistan and that there was a need
to confront and defeat such impulses, in the interest of not only our
region but also of the larger global community.
Throughout its military operations, India acted with unparalleled
restraint and scrupulously observed the sanctity of the LOC. In doing
so, our armed forces took unusually high casualties, which are a tribute
to their discipline and valour. In view of the relentless progress of
Indian forces on the ground, Pakistan had no option but to come to
an arrangement for withdrawing its troops to its own side of the
LOC. In exactly two months time from the day it had started,
Operation Vijay marked one of the great successes in the Indian
military history.
Violation of Indian Airspace by Pakistani Aircraft

The international community, while appreciating Indias position,
also pointed to the irresponsibility of Pakistans military action and
called for the immediate restoration of the LOC. India too emphasised
that the LOC was an essential confidence building measure and
indispensable for peace and security. Attempts by Pakistan to create
doubts about its clarity and validity were not only mischievous, but
also extremely dangerous and totally unacceptable to us. We also
pointed out that in the 27 years since the LOC had been demarcated
and marked on authenticated maps signed by senior military
commanders of both India and Pakistan, there had not been single
instance of its having been called into question.

During the year, Pakistan maintained its pattern of brazen
violations of the 1991 Agreement between India and Pakistan on
Prevention of Airspace Violations. On 10 August 1999, a Pakistan
Navy maritime surveillance-cum-combat Atlantique aircraft intruded
repeatedly and deep into Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch area
and was shot down by the Indian Air Force fighters when it failed to
heed to their signals to land. Part of the wreckage of the aircraft was
found inside Indian territory. Pakistan also used missiles on 11 August
1999 to target three Indian helicopters that were ferrying journalists
to the crash site. All of these actions are in keeping with Pakistans
wilful violation of confidence building measures.

The international community was kept continuously briefed of
Indias position during Operation Vijay. It was a measure of the
justness of Indias cause that our position found virtually universal

IC-814 Hijacking

An Indian Airlines aircraft was hijacked to Kandahar by five
persons on 24 December, 1999. Government secured the safe release
3

India's Neighbours

of passengers, crew and the aircraft in exchange for three terrorists,
including a Pakistani national. The hijacking was an example of
international terrorism at its worst. There is firm evidence that it was
engineered by Pakistan and fundamentalist groups that are based in
Pakistan and outside under its command and control. The Indian
authorities have also been able to identify the hijackers who are all
Pakistanis. Further, the majority of the terrorists whose release was
earlier sought by the hijackers were also Pakistanis. The destination
of the hijackers as well as of the three released terrorists was Pakistan.
Outlook for Future Relations

It was India that had initiated the composite dialogue process.
The Prime Ministers visit to Lahore was a path-breaking attempt to
reach out to Pakistan and permanently transform our relations. It
was also a manifestation of our desire to take them in a positive and
constructive direction. Pakistan embarked on a venture that
constituted betrayal of trust and revealed abiding hostility. It would,
therefore, be idle to pretend that this experience has not set back
India-Pakistan relations. The damage this action has done to mutual
relations is compounded by Pakistans continuing sponsorship of
terrorism against India as a matter of state policy.
Pakistan is now effectively under what amounts to martial law
following the military coup of 12 October 1999. The coup has
implications for our security interests and we have to take this into
account. Pakistan needs to restore mutual trust and confidence
through concrete and tangible action including the cessation of crossborder terrorism and hostile propaganda against India. The
sponsorship and instigation of cross-border terrorism by Pakistan in
Jammu & Kashmir and elsewhere in India constitutes a violation not
only of the LOC but also of the Simla Agreement. It is incumbent
upon Pakistan to abjure this brazen encouragement and abetment of
terrorism and dismantle the entire network that is set up in Pakistani
territory for this purpose. Continuous calls for jehad against India
can hardly be interpreted as messages for dialogue and peace. The

4

high-pitched propaganda against India, instances of which are rife in
the daily life of Pakistan, do not inspire confidence in Pakistans interest
in dialogue.
These are not preconditions but the very ingredients to foster
proper environment for a meaningful interaction between the two
countries.
The international community also recognises that all outstanding
issues between India and Pakistan should be settled bilaterally in a
peaceful manner. There is no place whatsoever for any third-party
mediation in this process.
Section2
Relations with our Eastern and Southern neighbours continued
to remain warm and friendly. The thrust of our policy towards this
region was to encourage mutually beneficial economic cooperation
and contacts at peoples level. Several new initiatives were launched
to achieve these objectives. Regular contacts were maintained at the
political level with a view to strengthening cooperative relations with
these countries and to sensitising them on the threat posed to the
democratic and social fabric of the region by forces of terrorism and
religious extremism.
Bangladesh

India continued to pursue a policy of further expanding and
deepening its traditionally close and friendly ties with Bangladesh.
There was a regular exchange of high level visits which contributed
to the promotion of mutual understanding and goodwill, with an
emphasis on economic cooperation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, accompanied by a
delegation which included the External Affairs Minister, Minister for
Railways and Surface Transport and Chief Minister of West Bengal
visited Dhaka on 19 and 20 June, 1999 on the occasion of the inaugural
run of the bus service from Calcutta to Dhaka. The bus service has

Annual Report 1999-2000

been welcomed by the people of the two countries with great joy. It
heralds a new dimension in bilateral relations and represents a
significant step in facilitating people-to-people interaction between
the two countries.
During the visit, Prime Minister held wide ranging discussions
with the President and Prime Minister of Bangladesh; the discussions
covered bilateral, regional and international issues. An Agreement to
extend a credit line of Rs.200 crore to Bangladesh, spread over three
years was signed. With a view to further enhancing trade, India has
agreed in principle to the Bangladeshi request for non-reciprocal dutyfree access for select items of export interest to Bangladesh. Both
sides also agreed upon the restoration of multi-modal communication
links between the two countries which should go a long way in
providing the infrastructure necessary to enable economic interaction
between India and Bangladesh attain its true potential. Both sides
also focussed on the need to provide a framework for border trade.
A proposal for the transshipment of Indian goods across Bangladesh
by Bangladesh carriers is under the active consideration of the
Government of Bangladesh. These issues will be examined by a Joint
Group of Experts.
The two Prime Ministers met again on 13 November 1999 on
the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
in Durban.
The Bangladesh Minister for Water Resources, Mr Abdur Razzak,
visited India in April 1999 in connection with the 33rd Session of the
Joint Rivers Commission. The Joint Committee of Experts on Sharing
of Waters of Common Rivers met twice during the year when
discussions were held on sharing of Teesta Waters. The Minister for
Commerce and Industries of Bangladesh , Mr Tofail Ahmed visited
India for bilateral talks on trade issues from 19-24 May 1999. The
Speaker of the Bangladesh Parliament, Mr Humayun Rasheed
Choudhury, visited India from 9-15 August 1999.

Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. Ajit Kumar Panja,
visited Dhaka from 20-22 January 2000, when he called on the Prime
Minister of Bangladesh and held fruitful discussions with the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture. His talks with the Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh covered the entire range
of bilateral interactions, with a view to identifying areas for focussed
attention in the coming months. An MOU on Agriculture was signed
during the visit. An important outcome of the discussions was the
decision to start a bus service between Agartala and Dhaka.
Interaction between the armed forces of India and Bangladesh
continued with the exchange of a number of high level delegations
between the two countries. The Bangladesh Defence Secretary, Mr
Mohammed Idris Ali visited India from 12-16 October 1999 along
with the Director General (Artillery ) of the Bangladesh Army and
Assistant Chief of Naval Staff on the occasion of Defexpo-99. The
Bangladesh Navy participated in the multilateral exercise MILAN-99
held at Port Blair from 30 March - 4 April 1999. Three Indian Navy
ships commanded by Rear Admiral V Bharatan made a goodwill visit
to Chittagong from 1-4 November 1999 and carried out a joint exercise
for the first time with three Bangladesh Navy ships on 4 November,
1999. As in previous years, a number of armed forces personnel of
Bangladesh also received training in India.
As part of the institutional dialogue on various issues relating to
border management, the Director General level meeting between the
Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles took place in Dhaka
from 24-28 October 1999. The Joint Working Group from the
respective Home Ministries also met in Dhaka in January 2000.
Secretary level talks on renewal of the India-Bangladesh Protocol
on Inland Transit & Trade was held in Dhaka from 26-28 October
1999. The Protocol was renewed upto 3 October 2001. The new
Protocol puts in place a framework which will facilitate movement of
cargo to the north eastern states. Under the new Protocol, Calcutta,
5

India's Neighbours

Haldia, Pandu and Karimganj on the Indian side and Narayanganj,
Sirajganj, Khulana and Mongla on the Bangladesh side have been
designated as Ports of Call. The Protocol also provides for steps to
ensure equal sharing of inter-country and transit cargo by the ships
of the two countries to and from ports of call/customs stations
including extended places of loading and unloading.
Maintaining the tradition of close and active interaction in the
field of education, India provided training facilities and scholarships
to Bangladeshi candidates under various schemes. A series of cultural
programmes by Indian artistes were also organized in Bangladesh. A
number of cultural programmes including film shows, art-exhibitions,
music concerts etc. were also organised by the Indian High
Commission in Dhaka with the participation of local artistes from
Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka

Indias relations with Sri Lanka continued to be cordial and
friendly. India expressed its consistent support for a peaceful
settlement of the ethnic conflict within the framework of Sri Lankas
unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. India views the ethnic issue
as complicated and best be resolved by Sri Lanka itself.
The Minister of State (EA), Shri A.K. Panja, led an Indian
delegation to Colombo in November 1999 to represent India at the
State sponsored funeral of late Mr. S. Thondaman, CWC Leader and
Minister of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure. Mr.
Thondaman was the leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress and was
held in high regard by the Indian Tamil Community in Sri Lanka.
As a follow up to the signing of India-Sri Lanka Free Trade
Agreement in December, 1998, an Indian delegation led by the
Commerce Secretary visited Colombo in May, 1999 and held
discussions with the Sri Lankan delegation led by Secretary to the
Treasury. The talks were inconclusive. After a further round of talks
in New Delhi in February 2000, letters were exchanged by which all

6

pending matters were resolved. The operationalisation of the FTA
will take place on March 1, 2000.
The Sri Lankan Defence Secretary visited India in August, 1999
and had detailed discussions with the Defence Secretary and the
Foreign Secretary. The discussions were focussed on security related
matters including training of Sri Lankan defence personnel in India
and the problems faced by Indian fishermen in the Palk Straits area.
Lt. Gen. Chandra Sekhar, PVSM, AVSM, ADC, Vice Chief of
Army Staff, represented India at the Golden Jubilee celebrations of
the Sri Lankan Army held in Colombo from 9-12 October, 1999.
The India-Sri Lanka Foundation was inaugurated by the Sri
Lankan Foreign Minister Mr. Lakshman Kadirgamar in Colombo on
19 November 1999, in pursuance of the MOU establishing the IndiaSri Lanka Foundation signed during the visit of the Sri Lankan
President to India in December, 1998. The Foundation would focus
on promotion of cultural and educational ties between the two
countries.
Maldives

India-Maldives relations have been close and friendly. India
attaches the highest importance to its relations with the Maldives and
is committed to cooperate with the Maldives in its developmental
efforts especially in the human resource development and health
sectors. During the year 1999, a number of visits were exchanged
between the two countries to strengthen cooperation in various areas
including medicine, meteorology and customs cooperation.
A Tripartite Agreement between India, Maldives and Indira
Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) was signed on
22.12.1999, under which IGNOU will launch Distance Education
programmes in the Maldives. Another Tripartite Agreement between
India, Maldives and the Educational Consultants India Limited has
been signed to facilitate tailor-made courses in India for Maldivian
students.

Annual Report 1999-2000

A two-member delegation from the Indian Meteorological
Department visited Male from 22 - 30 June 1999 in connection with
the upgradation of the Meteorological Data Reception Centre at Male.
The Centre was commissioned by Honble Abdulla Majeed, Deputy
Minister for Home Affairs, Housing and Environment of the
Government of Maldives from June 28, 1999.
The Fourth Joint Indo-Maldives Coast Guard Exercises under
the Dosti series was conducted from October 4-8, 1999.
Mr. Ahmed Abdullah, Minister of Health of Maldives visited India
from 22-24 April 1999. During his stay in India, he was called on by
the Health Secretary and Foreign Secretary, when ongoing bilateral
cooperation in the health sector was discussed.
Myanmar

India continued to pursue a policy of constructive engagement
with Myanmar with a view to strengthening the existing ties and broadbasing and diversifying areas of contact and cooperation. General
Maunge Aye, Vice Chairman, State Peace and Development Council,
Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Defence Forces and
Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar Army, visited Shillong from 7-8
January 2000, at the invitation of our Chief of Army Staff, who visited
Myanmar from 6-7 January 2000. He led a high level delegation
comprising of Ministers and senior officials. The visit provided an
opportunity to discuss a wide range of bilateral issues including control
of cross border insurgency, threat posed by religious fundamentalism,
trade and economic relations, travel linkages, tourism and cross border
projects in areas such as power, mining, etc. The Indian delegation
for the talks with General Maunge Aye was led by the Minister of
Commerce and Industry, Mr. Murasoli Maran and included the
Minister for Power, Shri R. Kumaramangalam. The two sides have
agreed upon specific steps to strengthen economic and security
cooperation.
Following a series of exchanges between the scientific

communities of the two countries, an Agreement on Cooperation in
the fields of Science & Technology was concluded during the visit of
the Myanmar Minister for Science and Technology to India in June
1999. The Heads of Survey Departments of India and Myanmar met
in Yangon (10-13 November), when, besides issues pertaining to
maintenance of boundary pillars along the 1643 Km international
border between India and Myanmar, the possibilities of cooperation
in the field of cartography were also discussed. The first ever visit to
India by a Naval Chief from Myanmar (14-20 November) laid the
foundation for closer interaction between the Navies of the two
countries.
India continued to cooperate with the Government of Myanmar
in its developmental efforts, including human resource development.
Technical teams from India visited Myanmar to assess the potential
for cooperation in areas such as power and to determine road and
riverine linkages between the North East and Myanmar. A sustained
dialogue on issues relating to border management was maintained
between senior civilian and army officials through established
institutional mechanisms. The 6th India-Myanmar National Level
Meeting, at the level of Home Secretaries was held in New Delhi
(July 28-30), and the 9th India-Myanmar Sectoral Level Meeting, at
the level of Joint Secretaries, was held in Kohima (11-13, November).
These meetings addressed issues such as border management,
promotion of trade and travel through land route, etc.
Section 3
Indias traditional friendship and cooperation with its northern
neighbours, Bhutan and Nepal, has continued to grow over the years.
Bhutan and Nepal are our closest neighbours, and this closeness is
evident in our common social values, traditions, extensive people to
people contacts, and wide ranging economic linkages. Our focus over
the year has been on mutually beneficial economic development, which
would help to improve the living conditions of people in the three
7

India's Neighbours

countries, and particularly of the people living on both sides of the
open India-Nepal and India-Bhutan border.
Nepal

Several initiatives were taken to further strengthen our interaction
with Nepal, and to consolidate the close and multifaceted cooperation
between the two countries.
The Foreign Minister of Nepal, Dr. Ram Sharan Mahat, paid an
official visit to India from 17-19 August 1999. During the visit, Dr.
Mahat called on the President and Prime Minister of India, besides
meeting his counterpart, the External Affairs Minister of India.
Although the visit was primarily for consultations on matters relating
to SAARC, it also provided an opportunity for exchange of views on
bilateral issues of mutual interest.
At the invitation of the Foreign Minister of Nepal, the External
Affairs Minister, Shri Jaswant Singh paid an official visit to Nepal
from 8-11 September 1999. The Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the
commitment of their respective governments not to allow their
respective territories to be used for activities prejudicial to the security
of the other. They directed their Survey Officials to complete the
demarcation of the Boundary in a time bound manner. The visit
provided an opportunity to review the entire gamut of bilateral

ndias relations with the countries of South East Asia have
traditionally been close and warm as we share a common historical
and cultural legacy. After the end of the cold war and since the
introduction of economic reforms in India, there has been a renewed
vigour in our relationship with the countries of the South East Asian
region. Indias Look East policy and countrys potential as a major
market have contributed significantly towards expanding and
diversifying Indias relations with the ASEAN region. The closeness
of the relationship is reflected in regular exchanges of high level visits,
like the recent visit of the President of Vietnam (December 1-5 1999),
the visit of the PM of Singapore (January 2000), the President of
Indonesia (February 2000) and the PM of Cambodia (February 2000)
to India, Joint Commission meetings with Vietnam and Laos, and
Foreign Office Consultations with the Philippines, Indonesia and
Australia etc.
India became ASEANs Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992 and
Full Dialogue Partner as well as a member of the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) in 1996. The growing ties with the ASEAN have further
developed in the recent years. The dialogue partnership with the
ASEAN has enabled India to significantly broaden and diversify its
relationship with the ASEAN member countries. The ASEAN
countries have recognised the positive role that India can play in
maintaining peace and stability in the region.

India has a fundamental interest in the regional security issues as
we share maritime boundaries with several ASEAN countries and
land and maritime boundary with Myanmar. India sought to promote
a wider and deeper contact with the ASEAN countries in the ASEAN
and ARF framework, to promote peace, development and security in
the region. Shri Jaswant Singh, External Affairs Minister led an Indian
delegation to the 32nd ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC)
and the 6th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meetings held in
Singapore in July 1999, and held bilateral meetings with his
counterparts from the ASEAN and the ARF member countries.
Currently, India is closely collaborating with the South East Asian
countries in various fields such as trade and investment, science and
technolog y, tourism, human resources and infrastructure
development. Such linkages are expected to intensify in the coming
years. Through the institution of dialogue partnership with ASEAN,
attempts are being made to identify areas for focussed interaction,
including formulation of concrete work programmes and action plans.
The total bilateral trade between India and the ASEAN countries
has increased from about US$ 2.5 billion in 1993-94 to US$ 5.98 bn.
in 1997-98 and $ 5.36 bn in 1998-99. With the regional economic
crisis having bottomed out, India hopes to increase trade both in
terms of quantity and value with the ASEAN countries and also
enhance mutual investments.

in the defence field, particularly training.
Bilateral trade remained low, but not insignificant, with US$ 3.31
million as Bruneis imports from India during 1998-99. In areas like

trategic and economic factors establish the importance and
relevance of the Central Asian States (CAS) to India. Their
geo-strategic location, both as an Eurasian bridge and a close
proximity to a number of regional hot spots; abundance of natural
resources including hydrocarbons; intense rivalries of, external players
over these resources; secularist state policy; close approximation of
national security interests and concerns of the CAS and India;
attraction of the CAS markets etc., are among these factors.
Indias political relations with the CAS are excellent, underpinned
by historic and cultural bonds and, since the independence of these
countries, marked by regular high level contacts. The recent incidents
of manifestation of cross-border terrorism in a number of these
countries illustrated the commonalty of the threat faced by both sides
as well as the need for coordinated action to combat the menace.
In the economic sphere, while there is natural justification for,
and expectation of, cooperation, given the economic resources of
these countries and Indias technological capabilities, transitional
difficulties have persisted in the CAS to date, negatively impacting on
two-way trade, which remains modest. Efforts are currently being
made to encourage Indian investors to enter the manufacturing sector

in these countries through joint ventures, commensurate with their
preferred policy. There is ample awareness in the CAS of Indias
strength in a number of niche areas, including small and medium
industries, and in human resource development. Slots under the ITEC
programme have been eagerly sought and utilized by these countries.
Drawing upon each others areas of expertise, scientific cooperation
has been an on-going feature of bilateral relations.
Interactions in the cultural sphere are strong. Apart from events
at the two Indian cultural centres in Tashkent and Almaty, as well as
activities under the CEP, including reciprocal days of culture, scholarly
exchanges have taken the form of frequent visits, seminars etc.

the gains of almost five decades of close ties of friendship with
the countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the countries
in this region are currently engaged in the simultaneous processes of
economic reform and political democratization. These processes,

our capacity to identify ourselves with the aspirations of the people
of Africa and to engage with them in a constructive programme of

elations between India and the Russian Federation have been
historically close, friendly and time tested. With the countries
of East and Central Europe, we have traditionally maintained
ties based on goodwill, friendship and close cooperation. The year
saw further consolidation and diversification of these ties to mutual
benefit. The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary were admitted
into NATO and several of them re-oriented themselves towards
joining Euro-Atlantic Security structures and the EU. Despite these
developments, the countries of East and Central Europe reiterated
that relations their relations with India will continue to develop on
the traditional friendly basis. Indias cooperation with these countries
is multi-dimensional in character and encompasses economic,
commercial, defence, scientific and technological and cultural spheres.
Bilateral exchanges at the political level have played a significant
role in the consolidation of our ties with these countries. These
exchanges provided an opportunity towards creating greater
understanding of each others interests and concerns. Efforts were
made to renew contacts between the Parliaments of these countries.
Specific steps were taken to impart a new thrust towards the expansion

52

of trade and economic cooperation. Initiatives were taken in
diversifying our cultural relations with them.
The President of the Russian Federation, Mr Boris Yeltsin,
resigned on 31 December 1999 and nominated Mr Vladimir Putin,
Prime Minister, as the Acting President. Mr Putin would also continue
to be the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Presidential
Elections are scheduled to be held on 26 March 2000 to elect a new
President of the Russian Federation.
Section 2

One of the main priorities in our foreign policy objectives
continued to be the strengthening of our time tested relations with
the Russian Federation. Our multi-dimensional relations with the
Russian Federation have been developing and expanding in all areas
of mutual interest to mutual benefit. We have sought to raise the level
of our bilateral ties to that of a strategic partnership. A Declaration
on Strategic Partnership will be signed between the two countries
during the next Summit meeting. The visit of External Affairs Minister
to the Russian Federation in May 1999 was an important milestone.
The visit to India by the First Deputy Prime Minister Khristenko
and the Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov lent further weight to our
interaction. The tradition of bilateral exchange of visits both at all
levels, including political and official, continued during the year.

otherwise. We called for commitments to the UN Charter by pointing

Western Europe
Western Europe is a region of considerable importance to India
both politically and economically. The European Union is lndias
largest trading partner and the second largest source of approved
foreign investment. India has traditionally maintained close and
friendly relations with the EU as well as with individual countries in
the region.
Europe is witnessing rapid moves towards greater integration:
economic, political, and strategic. The European single currency Euro
was adopted by 11 of the 15 EU member states on January 1, 1999.
The decision taken at the EU Cologne summit in June 1999 to create
a Common Foreign and Security Policy and to appoint a High
Representative for Foreign & Security Policy, marked tangible progress
towards the goal of political unity. The related decision to merge the

WEU into the EU marks a major step towards the evolution of a EU
collective self-defence. The expansion of the EU is bound to enhance
its political influence, although the economic costs will, in the short
term, be considerable.
India and the European Union are both addressing themselves
to the task of moving forward relations with the EU and its member
countries economically, commercially, politically and strategically.
During this period, some concrete measures towards the objective of
an intensified dialogue on global political and economic issues with
the European Union and its member countries have been put into
effect. A steady pace of interaction has been maintained at all levels
with the Governments in West Europe. The frequency of high-level
exchanges between India and the countries of Western Europe is
indicative of a mutual recognition of the advantages of, and need for,
closer interaction and co-operation.
The dialogue which has been conducted with various West ,Asian
countries, has led to a better understanding of lndias position on
various issues including on non-proliferation and disarmament. There
has also been a considerable growth in bilateral economic ties with
these countries as well as an all-round diversification in various fields
of co-operation.
The trend of warming and deepening of relations with the EU
and its member countries was amply demonstrated in the reaction of
these countries to the Kargil intrusions. There was a clear recognition
that the situation had been caused by cross-border infiltration and
violation of the Line of Control. Indias restraint throughout the crisis
in not crossing the LOC was also acknowledged and appreciated.
Their support and understanding of lndias position and concerns
was clearly reflected in individual country statements as well as those
of the EU.
Indias relations with France have gained momentum over the
year. The high-level political dialogue which was initiated with the
57

Europe

visit of French President Jacques Chirac in January 1998 continued
throughout 1999 as well.
The momentum of the relationship is demonstrated by the
numerous ministerial visits from both sides over the year: EAM visited
France on May 26-27, 1999 for bilateral talks and to attend the OECD
Ministerial Conference held in Paris. He also had meetings with French
President Chirac, Foreign Minister Vedrine, National Assembly
President Laurent Fabius and Senate President Christian Poncelet
during the visit. The visit provided an opportunity to extensively brief
the French side and place matters relating to the Kargil developments
in perspective. Jean Claude Gayssot, French Minister of Capital Works,
Transport and Housing, visited India in February 1999; Mr Claude
Allegre, French Minister for Higher Education, Research and
Technology in November 1999; Louis Besson, French Minister for
Public Works, Housing and Transport in December 1999; and Mr.
Francois-Poncet, Co-Chairman, lndo-French Initiative Forum in
December 1999.
Two rounds of talks were held under the lndo-French Strategic
Dialogue in January and July 1999. The Dialogue was instituted
following a high-level decision taken during the Indian Prime Ministers
visit to Paris in September 1998 and aimed at facilitating structured
and regular discussions on issues of core importance to both sides.
The lndo-French Initiative Forum, a high-level non-governmental
group of eminent personalities set up advise on ways of diversifying
and enriching the bilateral relationship, held two meetings in February
and September 1999. Foreign Office Consultations were held on June
30, 1999 in Paris. The Indo-French Joint High Committee on Defence,
a committee set up to examine the possibilities for defence cooperation, including defence industrial co-operation, held its second
meeting on July 5-6, 1999. The lndo-French Joint Working Group on
Energy held its first meeting on 15-16 March 1999 in New Delhi.
The lndo-French Water Week and the Higher Education in France
58

Forum were organised in India in November 1999. The France-India

Annual Report 1999-2000

a positive ambience for promoting bilateral exchanges and
cooperation. The visits of EAM and Principal Secretary to Prime
Minister, to the U.K in January and February 1999 respectively were
instrumental in an enhanced understanding of our concerns and
position on various issues.
Visits of senior British Ministers including Ms. Patricia Hewitt,

first Indian origin Minister in the British Cabinet and has responsibility
for the UKs relations with Europe and visa/consular matters.
Interaction between India and Germany at the very highest
levels, as well as the people-to-people level has been substantial.
Germany is Indias largest trade partner in Europe and second largest
worldwide, with a bilateral trade of around DM9 billion and a major
technology and investment source with total approved investment of
over Rs 64 billion. However, economic relations witnessed a downturn
in the year with a slump in bilateral trade.
Germany was very supportive of India during the Kargil crisis. It
was the term President of the EU as the crisis unfolded. The numerous
EU statements issued in connection with Kargil clearly acknowledged
that the confrontation was triggered off by infiltration into the Indian
side of the LOC.
EAMs visit to Germany on September 30- October 1, 1999
facilitated detailed discussions with the German President Rau and
Vice-Chancellor & Foreign Minister Fischer on issues of bilateral,
regional and multilateral importance. The visits of National Security
Advisor Brajesh Mishra to Germany in February and again in July
1999 were also marked by substantive and productive meetings. Prof.
Dr. Klaus Gretschmann, Director-General, Department of Economic
& Financial Affairs, and Personal Representative of Chancellor
Schroeder visited India on September 19-21, 1999 and had useful
interaction with Indian officials as well as with the Indian business
community. Dr. Theo Sommer, co-chairman of the Indo-German
Consultative Group and publisher of the influential Die Zeit, visited

Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Mr. Hans Uirich Klose in April
1999 and by Bundesrat President Prof. Dr. Kurt Biedenkopf in
December 1999. State level interaction was appreciable with visits to
60

India of the State Secretary for Economics of Bavaria in February
1999 and of Deputy Minister-President of Baden Wuerttemberg in
August 1999 and visits to Germany of the Chief Minister of Kerala
and Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan.
The high-level lndo-German Consultative Group, a Group of
eminent personalities which was set up to monitor ongoing
developments and trends in Indo-German relations, and suggest
policy measures for up-gradation of bilateral relations from a long
term perspective, held its eighth meeting on November 13 & 14,
1999 in Bangalore. The meeting generated useful ideas for the further
strengthening of bilateral relations, especially in the economic,
commercial and technological sectors.

Germany on 4-6 February 2000 to participate in the 36th Munich
Conference on Security Policy.
Relations with Austria entered into a new phase with the
exchange of the first Head of State level visit between India and
Austria. Rashtrapatiji visited Austria from 7-11 November 1999 and
exchanged views with the Austrian President, Thomas Kiestil and
the Federal Chancellor, Viktor Klima. The visit has led to an enhanced
understanding of lndias position and concerns on various issues.
Rashtrapatijis visit to Austria coincided with the celebration of

Annual Report 1999-2000

50 years of diplomatic relations between India and Austria, which
was marked by a number of cultural events and seminars in both
countries. During the visit, the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement
and the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement
were also signed. The lndo-Austrian Joint Commission met in Vienna
from 14-15 October 1999 to renew bilateral trade and commerce.
The first round of Foreign Office Consultations is scheduled for the

Italy has emerged as lndias fourth largest export market in the
EU. Indias US$ 2 billion annual bilateral trade with Italy constitutes
nearly 3% of lndias global trade and Italian investment in India has
reached US$ 700 million. A number of Indo-Italian Joint Ventures
are functioning satisfactorily in India.
The Italian Government offered food aid worth US$1.6 million
for the victims of the cyclone, which struck the state of Orissa in
November 1999. In November 99. Italy announced a grant of US$ 1
million for the national programme of eradication of poliomyelitis in

We continue to enjoy excellent political relations with Spain.
The economic content of our relationship has been on the upswing
in recent years. An encouraging element has been the interest shown
by regional trade and commercial bodies in Spain in looking at India
as a commercial destination. The Minister of Industry, Commerce

and Tourism of the Province of Catalunya, (Spain), Mr, Antoni Subira,
visited India from May 13-14 along with a business delegation. The
President of Catalunya, Mr. Jordi Pujoi visited India from 6-8
December 1999 to attend the Indian Economic Summit 1999
organised by the World Economic Forum. In an effort to promote
bilateral trade, Spain has been chosen as the partner country for India
Expo 2001. Although total Spanish investment in India has not
exceeded the modest figure of US$ 28 million, the volume of bilateral
trade with Spain has been steadily increasing and annual bilateral trade
stands at US$900 million. Shri Dilip Lahiri has been appointed as
lndias next Ambassador to Spain.
Our cordial relations with the Vatican were strengthened with
the State visit of Pope John Paul II to India from 5-7 November
1999. (This was the Popes second visit to India. He had earlier visited
India in 1986. An earlier Papal visit to India took place in 1964). The
main objective of the Popes visit to India was to sign and release the
post-synodal exhortation of the Special Assembly of the Synod of
Bishops for Asia held in the Vatican last year. During the visit, the
Pope expressed an appreciation for lndias secularism and religious
freedom and for the respect that Indian culture has for all religions.
The Popes visit has contributed to enhancing the international
communitys understanding of India as a multi-religious, multi-ethnic
society which is committed to the maintenance of secularism.
The high-point of our relationship with the Netherlands was
the visit of Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok from November 20-25,
1999. This was the first interaction at HOG/HOS level since 1993
and the first important interaction after our nuclear tests in May 1998.
The visit facilitated detailed discussions on issues of importance to
both sides, including bilateral relations, regional developments and
global issues. Co-operation in the economic and commercial field
prospered with bilateral trade amounting to US $ 1.3 billion. The
economic restrictions imposed by the Netherlands following the
61

T

here was increased dialogue and engagement with the United
States of America on a broad range of bilateral regional and
international issues besides the continuation of the ongoing
dialogue on security and nonproliferation issues. Regional
developments, particularly Pakistans armed intrusion in Kargil, the
military takeover in Pakistan, the evolving situation in Afghanistan
and the problem of terrorism, constituted important elements of
constructive dialogue with the US. The US also took steps to increase
cooperation in the energy sector. There was also a useful exchange of
views on WTO related issues in the context of the WTO Ministerial
Meeting in Seattle from 28 November to 3 December 1999. On the
other hand, the US continues to maintain many of the unilateral
restrictions it imposed under its domestic law in the wake of the
nuclear tests in May 1998. India also received broad support from
the US Congress on several issues of concern to India.
Following the nuclear tests, India had decided to engage in a
more intensive dialogue with the United States. Shri Jaswant Singh,
External Affairs Minister and Mr. Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary
of State were designated as Representatives to conduct this dialogue.
The talks are being conducted on the basis of the comprehensive

proposals that India has put forward on disarmament and
nonproliferation matters, our unilateral moratorium on explosive
nuclear tests, willingness to discuss converting this moratorium into
a de jure obligation, our offer to enter into constructive negotiations
on FMCT and reaffirming our policies of stringent control on export
of sensitive technologies. The dialogue is focussed on four issues.
These issued are: The CTBT, the FMCT, Export Controls and
Defence posture. On Export Control issues, following the Export
Control level meeting in New Delhi from 9 - 10 November 1998,
another expert level meeting was held in New Delhi from 29 - 30
March 1999.
There was an extensive exchange of views between July 1998
and January 1999. Following the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, it was
decided that the Government that assumes office after the General
Elections in September-October 1999 would take a decision on further
dialogue with the US on these issues. The dialogue was resumed in a
meeting between Shri Jaswant Singh and Mr. Strobe Talbott on
November 16-17, 1999 in London.
The dialogue has led to some progress in creating a better
understanding of Indias security concerns by the US authorities. The
two sides have agreed that the dialogue is useful for increasing mutual
65

The Americas

understanding and for the purpose of building broad-based relations
between India and the US and should continue.
Following Pakistans armed intrusion in Kargil and during the
Operation Vijay launched to evict the intruders, India kept the US
along with our other key interlocutors, informed on the developments
and the nature of the intrusion. The US took a forthright position
regarding Pakistans armed intrusion in Kargil and called for
withdrawal of the intruders. The US also expressed appreciation of
the restrained and responsible manner in which India conducted
Operation Vijay. Indias position drew support from the US Congress
and the US media.
India and the US also had the opportunity to exchange views on
issues of mutual concern during the meetings that Shri Jaswant Singh,
External Affairs Minister, had with Ms. Madeleine Albright, US
Secretary of State, at the margins of the ARF Meeting in Singapore
on 24th July 1999 and later on 24th September 1999 in New York
during the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly.
During these meetings, the US reiterated its desire for better relations
with India.
India and the US have also been engaged in consultations on the
problem of terrorism. As part of the dialogue on matters relating to
terrorism, official level talks were held in Washington from September
2-3, 1999 which was followed by another round of official level talks
in New Delhi on 17th September 1999. The two Government have
agreed to intensify cooperation in this area. The Indo-US Extradition
Treaty, signed on 25th June 1997 in Washington, came into force
after the exchange of the Instruments of Ratification on 21st July
1999 in New Delhi. The Treaty represents an important step in the
law enforcement cooperation between India and USA in the area of
counter-terrorism.
66

As part of the process of regular consultations on bilateral,
regional and international issues. Shri Brajesh Mishra, National
Security Advisor, visited the US from 26-28 October 1999. The US
Deputy Trade Representative, Susan Esserman visited India from
1st to 3rd November 1999 for discussion on WTO related issues, in
the context of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle. From 28th
November to 3rd December 1999. The US Secretary of Energy, Mr.
Bill Richardson visited New Delhi on 26th October 1999. During his
visit, the US Secretary of Energy discussed cooperation in the fields
of energy and environment. The External Affairs Minister. Shri
Jaswant Singh and the US Energy Secretary also signed a Joint
Statement on Cooperation in Energy and Related Environmental
Aspects. General VP Malik, Chief of the Army Staff, visited the US
from 8th to 17th November 1999 to participate in the Conference of
the Defence Chiefs of Asia-Pacific Countries in Honolulu hosted by
the US Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Command.
Following the nuclear tests in May 1998, the US had imposed
certain restrictive measures against India. Effective from 1st December
1998, the US had partially lifted some of these restrictions till 21st
October 1999. In partial exercise of the fresh waiver authority given
by the Defence Authorisation Act 2000, passed by the US Congress
in October 1999, the US Government once again removed some of
the economic restrictions with effect from 27th October 1999.
However, non-basic humanitarian financing from multilateral financial
institutions is still subject to US restrictions. India regards these
unilateral restrictive measures as unjustified and counter-productive,
which should lifted in entirety. Several members of the US Congress,
including the Chairperson of the House International Relations
Committee. Mr. Benjamin Gilman, has written to the US President
to remove restrictions on the US support for loans to India by the
World Bank and other international financial institutions.

Annual Report 1999-2000

There was a considerable increase in bilateral dialogue between
India and the US during the period January to March 2000. The
dialogue on Nonproliferation, Security and Disarmament, which was
resumed in London in November 1999, was further continued from
January 18-19, 2000 in London. Apart from security issues, the two
sides also had extensive discussions on counter-terrorism, the hijacking
of IC-814, regional developments and President Clintons visit to India.
At London, the two sides announced the creation of the IndoUS Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism to institutionalise
their cooperation in combating all forms of terrorism. The Joint
Working Group on Counter-terrorism held its first meeting from

countering terrorism and also agreed to work together to bring the
perpetrators of the hijacking of IC-814 to justice.
The Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral
Dennis Blair, visited India from January 8-12, 2000. This follows the

included influential Congressmen such as Senator Tom Daschle,
Senate Minority Leader; Representative Sam Gejdenson, Ranking
Democrat in the House International Relations Committee; and,

Senator Sam Brownback, Chairman of the Senate Sub Committee
on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs.
Visit of President Bill Clinton

President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit India for five days
from 20th March 2000. Both sides expect that the visit of the US
President will pave the way for qualitatively new and closer relations
between the two democracies.
Canada
In the wake of Indias nuclear tests in May 1998, Canada had
decided to put political contacts with India on hold. However during
the current year. Canada has taken steps to re-establish political
contacts with India. A Canadian delegation led by Secretary of State
(Asia Pacific), Raymond Chan, visited India from 13-15 May, 1999.
During the ARF meeting held in Singapore in July 1999, EAM
had talks with the Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy. The
two Foreign Ministers also had the occasion to meet during the
Durban CHOGM in November. These meetings were utilised by
EAM to put Indias views on the question of CTBT and Nuclear
Doctrine in the right perspective.
Trade between the two countries has been on the rise. Indian
exports during the period January-August 1999 stood at Rs. 1,858
crores registering an increase of 10%. Indian imports from Canada
during the same period stood at Rs. 695 crores, up by 21%. A large
number of Indian delegations visited Canada during the year. Some
business delegations from Canada also visited India. Among the
important Indian visits, was that by a 7-member CII delegation in
August 1999. The delegation met the Chamber of Commerce besides
meeting with various Canadian business houses. These visits are
expected to result in further growth in economic and commercial
cooperation between the two countries.
67

The Americas

Latin America and the Caribbean
Indias relations with the countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean region have been traditionally problem-free and cordial.
The thrust of our policy towards the region is to strengthen and
widen the existing relationship and to give more economic content
to it. Our interactions and cooperation, both at the bilateral and
multilateral levels, have been mutually beneficial. India maintains, at
present, 13 resident diplomatic missions and one post in the region.
Eleven countries from the area have their resident missions in New
Delhi.
An important component of our bilateral relations has been the
mechanism of Foreign Office level bilateral consultations. Over the
years we have signed MOUs on the subject with ten countries from
the region and a few more are under consideration. The regular review
of bilateral relations has facilitated a better understanding of the
potentials and concerns of the dialogue partners and has led to
improved coordination on multilateral issues of mutual interest. Other
official and technical level visits have complemented the Foreign
Office level consultations. In the economic and trade arenas there
has been a growing interaction at the private sector level giving depth
to our relationships.
As a follow up of the FOCUS LAC Programme of the
Government of India, participation by Indian Export Promotion
Councils and business houses in international exhibitions in the Latin
American and Caribbean region as well as visits by trade delegations
to the region have helped dissemination of valuable information on
Indian commodities and technological advancement. Concerted
efforts have been made to overcome the barriers of distance and
language. In this context another important element has been the
liberalisation of many economies in the region opening up avenues
68

for enhanced cooperation. We have signed trade and economic
agreements with seven countries of the region and set up business
councils with some others. As a result of the growing understanding
between the private sectors of LAC and India, a number of accords
have also been signed between the apex trade and industrial bodies.
However, because of the economic difficulties that the region as a
whole continued to experience during the year, the actual increase in
overall trade with India was marginal and currently stands at US$
1.32 billion only.
Culturally India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region.
Indian philosophy, yoga and Mahatma Gandhi and his teachings have
been a source of inspiration for many in the region. Between them
the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have named more
than five hundred institutions, schools, libraries, streets and squares
after India and its leaders. As a mark of respect to our Father of
Nation, his busts and statues have been installed at important places
in a number of countries in the region. The latest being the one
unveiled at the campus of the University of Londrina in Brazil on
November 19 1999. The bust was gifted by the ICCR to the Centre
for Afro-Asian Studies of the University. At the institutional level we
have cultural agreements and cultural exchange programmes with
fourteen countries in the LAC area. Indian artists and academicians
have visited the region with the help of ICCR. Another interesting
aspect of our cultural relations with the Caribbean region in particular
is that some of the countries there have a substantial population of
Indian origin that still has a high regard for its cultural heritage.
Technical assistance under the ITEC Programme for students,
academicians and technical personnel for training and study tours in
India is another important mechanism by which we forge mutually
beneficial relations with the LAC countries.

Annual Report 1999-2000

The region has witnessed steady progress towards
democratisation and economic liberalisation. Presidential elections
were held during the reporting period in Antigua and Barbuda, El
Salvador, Panama, Argentina and Uruguay. In Guyana, a new President
took office due to the ill health of Mrs. Jannet Jagan and in Paraguay,
a new President assumed office after Mr. Raul Cubas resigned. The
countries in the region are steadfastly promoting regional groupings.
There has also been a tendency towards developing a Pan American
approach to national and international issues. The opposition of the
countries of the region to the US-sponsored economic and trade
embargo against Cuba is indicative of this approach. Keeping the
above in mind we have established institutional relations with regional
organisations. India has observer status with the Organisation of
American States (OAS), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)
and the Andean Community. Our High Commissioner in Georgetown
(Guyana) is concurrently accredited as Indias Ambassador to
CARICOM. We have been participating regularly in the meetings of

United Nations and International Organisations

Introduction

T

he year 1999 was an eventful one for the United Nations. The
Security Council had before it important matters concerning
resolution of conflicts in different parts of the world like
Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Congo and Lebanon. Debate on
important issues relating to Security Council restructuring and
terrorism continued during the year in concerned Committees and
Working Groups. India remained actively involved in all these matters
and breakthroughs were achieved in the area of terrorism where Indias
proposal for a comprehensive convention on international terrorism
has received approval for initiation of discussions in September 2000.
Public support for Indias candidature to the Security Council was
forthcoming from Russia, Vietnam and Laos.
The General Assembly was held against the backdrop of an
ongoing debate on the concept of humanitarian intervention. Kosovo
and East Timor had sensitised the world on this matter and India
continued to be an active participant in the global debate on the
subject.
Political Issues in the UN

Security Council Expansion & Indias Candidature

The Open Ended Working Group of the UN General Assembly

72

on the Restructuring of the Security Council wound up its deliberations
for the year on 30.7.99 without making any substantial progress. No
decisions were arrived at on any of the key issues including categories
to be expanded, size of the expanded Council, the question of veto
and review mechanism. The report of the OEWG recommends that
the Group would continue its work and submit its report including
any agreed recommendation at the end of the next (54th) session of
the UNGA in September 2000.
Several countries addressed the subject of UN expansion and
restructuring in their plenary speeches at the 54th UNGA. Among
these, Vietnam and Laos expressed support for Indias candidature
to an expanded Security Council. Russia also expressed support for
Indias candidature earlier during the debate in OEWG.
The question of UN Security Council restructuring was also
debated under Agenda Item 38 during the closing days of the session.
The debate only revealed the wide differences in opinion and stands
that still exist. Support for Indias candidature was expressed by Cyprus
& Mauritius.
New NonPermanent Members of Security Council Selected

General Assembly on 14th October, 1999 selected five new
members who would begin their two-year term as non-permanent
members of the Security Council starting 1st January, 2000. These
members are :

There will be no change in the OEWG Group in the year 2000.

The 54th UN General Assembly

The 54th session of the UN General Assembly officially
commenced on 14th September, 1999 with the election of Mr. TheoBen Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia as the President of the
Session.
The 54th UNGA had a 172-item agenda dealing with political,
economic, social and development issues. An important aspect of
the 54th UNGA has been the focus and widespread interest on the
question of humanitarian intervention that was sparked of by the
Secretary General who led off the general debate by inviting the GA
to consider laying down terms and conditions under which
humanitarian intervention would be carried out. Opinion on the
subject was divided and it was rejected by NAM during the Ministerial
meeting on the margins of the GA.
The Indian delegation to the 54th Session of the UN General
Assembly was headed by the External Affairs Minister Shri Jaswant
Singh who addressed the Plenary Session on September 22, 1999. As
this was the last UNGA session of the 20th century, his address
surveyed the major developments of the century. The dominant
themes of the address were the global menace posed by terrorism,
including narco-terrorism, recent developments in Indo-Pak relations
and global nuclear disarmament. Indias interest in a permanent
membership of an expanded Security Council was reiterated with
EAM mentioning that by any objective criteria Indias credentials for
permanent membership are persuasive.
Other important developments from Indias point of view are

the expression of support for Indias candidature by Russia, Laos,
Vietnam, Cyprus and Mauritius in spite of the fact that debate on the
question of the UN restructuring was conclusive only in once more
reflecting the wide differences in opinions and stands that prevail.
Indias initiative in the Sixth Committee also resulted in adoption
of the Convention for Suppression of Terrorist Financing as well as
the resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism
which has the provision for discussing Indias draft of a
Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism from
September 2000.
NAM

NAM Foreign Ministers Meeting was held on the margins of
the 54th UNGA on September 24, 1999 to coordinate NAMs
approach to issues deliberated during the GA session.
The meeting adopted a statement, which covered political and
economic development since the XIIth NAM Summit at Durban. It
reiterated NAM position on Security Council restructuring, selfdetermination and terrorism. It also expressed deep concern at the
updating of strategic defence doctrines that set out new rationales
for the use of nuclear weapons. It expressed deep concern over the
new Alliance Strategic Concept adopted by NATO in April, 1999
and the negative implications of the development and deployment of
anti-ballistic missile system. The statement reiterated the decision of
the Durban Summit mandating the Coordinating Bureau to study
further the question of mechanism for peaceful settlement of disputes
between member states and rejected the so called concept of
humanitarian intervention.
EAM in his address to the Meeting emphasised the need for
maintaining and reinforcing unity of the movement.

Terrorism

The phenomena of international terrorism was an important area
73

United Nations and International Organisations

of attention of the UN during the year. The Ad Hoc Working Group
of the Sixth Committee had before it drafts of the French sponsored
Convention on Suppression of Terrorist Financing which was adopted
and the Russian sponsored Convention against Nuclear Terrorism
which is still in debate.
The Sixth Committee of the UN General Assembly also adopted
the resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism in
November 1999 during the General Assembly session. This resolution
contains provision for initiating work on the Indian sponsored draft
convention on international terrorism in September 2000. The
resolution also refers to the Egyptian proposal for convening a global
conference to discuss the issue of terrorism.
Important aspects of the Indian sponsored convention are that
they lay emphasis on responsibility of states and also covers terrorist
acts in all its aspects. All previous international conventions on
terrorism concentrated only on specific acts of terrorism e.g.. terrorist
bombing, hijacking, etc.
The Convention on Suppression of Terrorist Finance and the
resolution on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism were
subsequently adopted by the main GA on 9th December, 1999.
UN Security Council on October 19, 1999 adopted resolution
No. 1269 condemning all acts of terrorism and calling upon all States
to combat terrorism in all its forms. An important element of the
resolution is that it calls upon all states to prevent and suppress
preparation and financing of any acts of terrorism in their territories
and deny safe havens to terrorists. The resolution was adopted at the
initiative of Russia.
Peacekeeping

UNIFIL, Lebanon: The UN Security Council on 30.7.99 voted
to extend the mandate of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
for a further period of six months until end January 2000. In its

74

unanimous resolution the Council reiterated its strong support for
the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Lebanon within its internationally recognised borders. It also stresses
the need for urgent implementation of its resolution 425 of 1978
which initially set up the UNIFIL to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli
forces from Southern Lebanon, restore international peace and
security and assist Lebanon to re-establish its authority in the area.
India had contributed the IInd Battalion of the 4th Gorkha
Regiment to UNIFIL. The battalion completed its one year term of
duty in November 1999 and has been replaced by a battalion from
the Madras Regiment.
Democratic Republic of Congo: On 10.7.99 in Lusaka, the
Heads of State of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia,
Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe and the Minister of Defence of
Angola signed an agreement for the cessation of hostilities between
all the belligerent forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The
representatives of the rebel forces The Rally for a Democratic Congo
and the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo declined to sign.
The agreement contains modalities for implementation of a ceasefire and establishment of a joint military commission comprising two
representatives from each party under a neutral Chairperson to be
appointed by the OAU in consultation with the parties.
It also contains provisions for the constitution, facilitation and
deployment of an appropriate force by the UN in collaboration
with OAU.
In anticipation of requirement of peacekeeping troops, the UN
Department of Peacekeeping operations has initiated contingency
planning and approached various countries, including India, to provide
troops.
India has already contributed 20 Army officers as Military liaison
officers for the UN Mission in Congo.

Annual Report 1999-2000

UNOMSIL, Sierra Leone: A peace agreement was signed
between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary
United Front of Sierra Leone in Lome on 7.7.99.
UN Security Council on October 22, 1999 passed resolution No.
1270 establishing the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL). The
resolution authorises deployment of a 6000-strong UN peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone.
The first group of these peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone on
29th November,1999. Among other tasks, the UN Mission in Sierra
Leone will assist the Government in the implementation of the
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration plan, and monitor
adherence to the cease-fire assistance. The peacekeeping troops will
work together with some 220 UN military observers already on the
ground in Sierra Leone.

parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the months of July and October
1999 for an initial period of one year.
Kosovo: International efforts towards resolving the crisis in
Kosovo culminated in an agreement being hammered out and
legitimised vide the UN resolution No. 1244 of June 10, 1999 whereby
Yugoslav forces would withdraw from Kosovo to make way for the
entry of an international force with NATO at its core as well as a
parallel civilian interim administration under the UN flag. The UN
resolution on Kosovo clearly indicates that the political solution for
Kosovo will be based on principles enunciated by the G-8.
The UN presence in Kosovo with the acronym UNMIK (United
Nations Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo) has four main
components, each with a partner agency.
u Interim civil administration: the United Nations;

India has confirmed contribution of 2 Infantry battalions (of
which one has already been deployed), a level-3 medical unit, a quick
reaction company and a medium helicopter transport unit along with
an aviation refuelling unit for UNAMSIL. With complete deployment
of the above military configuration, India will be the single largest
contributor of troops in UNAMSIL. Other major troop contributors
are Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana. Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India
has been appointed as the Force Commander of UNAMSIL. Prior
to the creation of UNAMSIL, the UN had only an observer mission
in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL).

u

Humanitarian affairs: the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHRR);

u

Institution-building: the Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); and

u

Reconstruction: the European Union.

In a related development, Mr. Oluyemi Adeniji, a senior diplomat
from Nigeria, has been appointed as UNSGs Special Representative
and Head of UNAMSIL, on 19th November, 1999.

East Timor

Bosnia: UN Security Council vide its resolution No. 1247 dated
18.6.99 has extended the mandate of UNMIBH upto 21.2.2000. India
has contributed 134 civilian police officers for the UN Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. These officers were deployed in various

India has contributed 88 civilian police officers to UNMIK. The
officers were deployed in Kosovo in early December 1999. In addition,
two companies of CRPF Rapid Action Force have also been
committed for UNMIK by the Indian government.
A major breakthrough on the question of East Timor was reached
when the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal, in the presence
of the UN Secretary General signed two agreements on 5.5.99
concerning details for holding of a ballot to decide the question of
autonomy for East Timor.
After some initial delay, consultative balloting was finally held in
75

United Nations and International Organisations

East Timor on 30th August, 1999. The exercise saw 438,968 persons
or 98% of the registered voters cast their ballot. Results of the ballot
announced by the UN Secretary General on 3rd September, 1999
indicated that a total of 344, 580 or 78.5% of the voters had voted
against the proposed special autonomy status, thereby indirectly opting
for ultimate independence. The balloting was followed by an escalation
of violence and fighting between the pro-independence and prointegration factions in the Island.
In response to widespread international reaction to the killings
and the humanitarian crimes which followed, the UN Security Council
adopted Resolution No. 1264 on 15th September, 1999 and gave
approval for the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force
in East Timor. The multinational task force, going by the acronym
INTERFET (International Force in East Timor) consists mainly of
the Australian troops with contributions in various forms also from
Thailand, the UK, France, Canada, the US, Singapore, New Zealand
and some others.
This was followed by the Security Council resolution No. 1272
(1999) of 25th October, 1999 which established the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) as a Chapter
VII exercise. The resolution empowers UNTAET with the overall
responsibility for the administration of East Timor and also gives it
legislative and judicial powers. The resolution gives mandate for
UNTAET for an initial period until 31st January, 2001.
A Donors Meet for East Timor was held in Tokyo from 16-17,
December,1999 under the co-chairmanship of World Bank and
UNTAET. The donors pledged a total of US$ 522 million in a three
year programme to accelerate the nation building process
Afghanistan

International efforts under the aegis of the UN to find a peaceful
solution to the Afghan problem continued through out the year
without any success. The group of 6+2 held their last meeting in

76

Tashkent on 19-20 July, 1999, where they reiterated that negotiations
for a peace settlement in Afghanistan must be conducted under the
UN auspices in a two-stage manner, the first stage consisting of
confidence building measures including immediate and unconditional
ceasefire as well as direct negotiations and followed by the second
stage where the Afghans would themselves draw up basic principles
for a future Afghan State. Almost immediately after 6+2 meeting in
Tashkant, the Taliban launched an offensive on July 28,1999 against
other factions.
On 27th August, 1999 the UN held an open debate on
Afghanistan in which India also participated. The debate generally
saw countries taking tough positions against the Taliban.
Indian statement during the debate noted that the criminal
conduct of Taliban had negative implication for peace and security in
Afghanistan and the region. India also drew attention to international
terrorist groups who find a safe haven in Afghanistan and the
dangerous nexus between the Taliban, terrorism and the drug mafias
operating in the region. India called upon the Security Council and
the international community to take meaningful and effective measures
in this regard.
The Security Council on 15.10.99 passed resolution No. 1267 on
the situation Afghanistan. The resolution calls upon all States to deny
permission to any Taliban owned or leased aircraft to take off from
or land in their territory and also freeze funds and other financial
resources of the Taliban. This is the first time that elements of
sanctions are included in a Security Council resolution on Afghanistan.
India played an active role in the formulation of the resolution.
The sanctions on the Taliban came into effect on 14th November,
1999.
Iraq

The UN Security Council remained engaged on the question of

Annual Report 1999-2000

sanctions against Iraq for a considerable part of the year. At the centre
of their discussions were two drafts concerning economic sanctions
against Iraq. The first, a Russian resolution supported by China,
France, Malaysia and Namibia and the second one proposed by Britain
with the support of the US. The two drafts, while having common
elements on the strengthening of mechanisms for verification of
weapons and inspection systems, differed greatly on the question of
easing of sanctions.
The Security Council finally adopted Resolution No. 1284 (1999)
on 17th December, 1999.
This so-called Omnibus or Comprehensive resolution
authorises the creation of a successor body to UNSCOM called
UNMOVIC (UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission), for the verification of compliance by Iraq of various
resolutions, particularly UNSCR 687(1991).
Once UNMOVIC and the IAEA report that Iraq has been
cooperating in all respects with their reinforced monitoring system
for a period of 120 days, the sanctions would be suspended for 120
days, renewable by the Council.
Ceiling for the export of Iraqi oil under the oil for food
programme has been removed.
The United Nations programme of humanitarian assistance to
Iraq known as Oil For Food Programme continued to be regularly
extended by the Security Council.
Iraq however has given oral notification on 20th November 1999
that it rejects further extension of Oil-for-Food programme and
informed the UN that it would not renew the Memorandum of
Understanding governing the Councils Oil-for-Food programme.
South Asia Task Force

The SATF was set up in 1988 following the nuclear tests in South

Asia. Members of the SATF are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russia,
United Kingdom, United Sates, European Union and Ukraine.
The SATF held an official level meeting in Kyiv on 23rd June,
1999. In addition to the expected calls to both India and Pakistan to
adhere to the CTBT and expression of concern at the absence of
progress in the implementation of UNSCR 1172, reference was also
made to the fighting in Kargil.
The SATF also met at the official level in New York on September
7 and November 5, 1999. It is understood that the general sense in
New York was that the group had not been able to achieve much and
there was no decision on future action except that the members should
continue their dialogue with India and Pakistan and exchange views
among themselves. It is important to note that France was the only
member to insist that SATF should be wound up and that the dialogue
should be pursued at bilateral levels. Other members particularly the
US, the UK and China, wanted the group to continue.
Indo-Pak Matters

Atlantique Episode: The Secretary General of the UN
expressed regrets over the loss of lives following the downing of the
Pakistani Atlantique surveillance aircraft by the Indian Airforce and
concern at repeated incidents between India and Pakistan. He also
urged that differences between the two countries be resolved by
peaceful means.
The Security Council did not accept Chinas proposal to issue a
Presidential Statement on the subject.
Pakistan took the matter to the International Court of Justice,
The Hague and the matter is under examination by the ICJ.
Kargil: In his report on the Work of the Organisation, the
Secretary General mentioned that the recent upsurge of fighting along
77

United Nations and International Organisations

and across the line of control in Kashmir, specially in the Kargil area
is a reminder of the fragility of the situation in this region. The SG
also stressed the need to put the Lahore Process back on track.
Separately, the Kargil issue was also touched upon in the statement
issued at the end of the G-8 Summit on 20th June, 1999, where deep
concern was expressed about continuing military confrontation in
Kashmir following the infiltration of armed intruders which violated
the Line of Control. The G-8 statement also called for restoration,
and full respect in future for the Line of Control, thus vindicating
Indias stand.
Hague Peace Conference

To commemorate the centenary of First Hague Peace Conference
of 1899, the Netherlands and the Russian Federation organised an
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in The Hague from 17-19 May,
1999 to be followed by the Intergovernmental Conference at St.
Petersburg from 22-25 June, 1999.
The two IGCs were preceded by an NGO event at The Hague
on May 11-15,1999. The basic idea was to provide an alternative forum
for discussions on matters relating to disarmament, human security,
resolution of conflicts, human rights, etc. and ultimately forward the
results of the conference to the UN as input during its discussions.
The results and suggestions of the meetings are supposed to nonbinding.
Disarmament and International Security
Indias stand on issues related to disarmament and international
security in multilateral and regional forums continues to reflect Indias
national security interests and the nations tradition of restraint and
engagement with the international community. In particular, Indias
commitment to non-discriminatory and universal nuclear
disarmament continued to be reflected in Indias pronouncements
and initiatives. At the regional level, India pursued purposeful dialogue

78

aimed at building confidence, trust and cooperative security structures.
The visit undertaken by the Prime Minister to Lahore in Pakistan on
the inaugural run of the Delhi-Lahore-Delhi bus service, the
agreements signed during the visit as well as the visit of the External
Affairs Minister to Beijing demonstrate that given the political will
the region is capable of responsibly managing the nuclear dimension
of bilateral security equations. This certainly is an important objective
for India.
The challenge of Pakistans aggression in the Kargil sector of
Jammu & Kashmir and its attempt to question the sanctity of the
Line of Control in violation of the commitments undertaken at Shimla
and Lahore was met through a skilful use of diplomacy and military
force. The international community has appreciated the restraint
shown by India during this conflict.
The series of bilateral dialogues commenced after the nuclear
tests of May 1998 were pursued during this year with the objective of
harmonising Indias security concerns with international concerns
on non-proliferation and disarmament. The results of these dialogues
are encouraging. In particular there is greater appreciation of Indias
security concerns and the underpinning of restraint and responsibility
in Indias conduct and policies post May 1998.
United Nations General Assembly

India participated in the First Committee of the 54th United
Nations General Assembly held in New York from October 11November 12, 1999. India put forward its traditional resolutions on
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons
adopted by the General Assembly by 104 votes in favour, 42 against
and 17 abstentions, and on the Role of Science and Technology in
the Context of International Security and Disarmament, adopted by
the General Assembly 98 votes in favour, 46 against and 19
abstentions. In addition, a new resolution which was introduced by
India last year, to highlight the dangers associated with hair-trigger

Annual Report 1999-2000

alert of nuclear Weapons leading to risks of accidental or unauthorized
launch of nuclear weapons, was adopted by the General Assembly by
104 votes in favour, 43 against and 17 abstentions. India projected its
national policy on Nuclear Disarmament and was actively involved
in deliberations on a number of resolutions in the First Committee.
Conference on Disarmament

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) could not undertake any
substantive negotiations during 1999 in the absence of adoption of
its Programme of Work due to lack of consensus on two issues Nuclear Disarmament and Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer
Space (PAROS). The areas on which consensus existed included reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committees on FMCT and Negative
Security Assurances, and the reappointment of Special Coordinators
dealing with a ban on transfer of Anti Personnel Landmines (APLs),
Transparency in Armaments (T1As) and procedural/reform issues
relating to the CD. following the adoption of the traditional agenda
early in the 1999 session, the remaining time of the CD was taken up
in trying to craft a balanced and comprehensive Programme of Work,
an exercise which remained inconclusive. The only important decision
adopted by the CD during the year related to the expansion of its
membership by admitting five new members - Ecuador, Ireland,
Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia. India along with a number of other
countries remained actively engaged in the work of the CD and efforts
to reach a consensus on its Programme of Work. India remains
supportive of a comprehensive and balanced Programme of Work in
the CD.

United Nations Disarmament Commission

The 1999 Substantive Session of the UTNDC from April 12-30
in New York addressed three issues, all of which were in the final
year of their deliberations in the respective Working Groups: The
establishment of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones on the basis of
arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region

concerned (NWFZs); the Fourth Special Session of the General
Assembly devoted to disarmament (SSOD-IV); and Guidelines on
conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament, with
particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of
General Assembly Resolution 51/45 N (CD). The UTNDC reached
consensus on Guidelines pertaining to NWFZs and CD. No
consensus was possible on SSOD-IV due to absence of agreement
on the Chairpersons Paper concerning the Objectives and Agenda
of SSOD-IV. Indias position was that SSOD-IV should reaffirm
the principles and priorities of SSOD-1, which accord priority to
nuclear disarmament.
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)

As an original state party to the CWC, India has endeavoured to
discharge, fully and faithfully, its obligations under the Convention.
On 29th April 1999, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons (OPCW), which is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands
completed two years of its existence. During this period, the Technical
Secretariat (TS) of the OPCW has conducted more than 400
inspections at chemical weapons storage and former production
facilities, as well as at industrial plant sites in States Parties to the
Convention. A number of inspections have taken place in India, and
our cooperation with the OPCW in implementing the CWC has been
impeccable. As a member of the Executive Council from the entry
into force of the Convention, India has been playing an active role in
the deliberations of the Council to oversee the implementation of all
obligations assumed by States Parties. The lack of progress in
implementing some of the provisions of the convention that are of
interest to the developing countries, such as those relating to
International Cooperation and assistance, casts a shadow on what is
otherwise a unique disarmament treaty. It is also a matter of collective
concern that some States Parties have not provided full declarations
to the OPCW, adversely affecting the inspection schedules.

United Nations and International Organisations

Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention

India actively participated in the work of Ad Hoc Group of States
Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in
Geneva during 1999 to negotiate a Protocol on the basis of the agreed
mandate. The Indian delegation continued to support strengthening
of BTWC through an effective Protocol for creating a nondiscriminatory and transparent compliance regime including the
unimpeded exchange of bio-technology for peaceful purposes.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)

The 43rd General Conference (GC) of the IAEA was held from
September 27 - October 1, 1999. The Indian delegation was led by
Dr. R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission. After
25 years a resolution on amendment to Article VI of the IAEA Statute,
relating to the membership of the Board of Governors, finally received
the approval of the General Conference. The Board of Governors
was expanded by 8 seats from the present 35 to 43. The final proposal
increases the seats for Middle East & South Asia (MESA), the area
group India belongs to and is the Chairman of, by 1 elected and 1
designated seat. Presently MESA has 1 designated seat (India) and 3
regular seats as well as 2 floating seats shared between 3 area groups.
In the Committee of the Whole, India as the Chairperson of the
Group of 77, introduced the resolutions pertaining to Strengthening
of the Agencys technical cooperation activities, Plan for producing
potable water economically, Extensive use of isotope hydrology for
water resource management, Staffing of the Agencys Secretariat and
Women in the Secretariat.
Third UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful
Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE-III)
The third UN Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space (UNISPACE-III) was held at Vienna in July 1999.
Professor U.R. Rao of India was elected as President of the
Conference. The Indian presence at the Conference was active and
80

positive: India participated in the Space Exhibition, the Technical
Forum meeting organised workshops, and also supported the Space
Generation Forum (for youth). The Conference adopted the Vienna
Declaration which essentially recognises the need for international
cooperation in the peaceful uses of the outer space and outlines
definitive recommendations to achieve these objectives.
Anti-Personnel Landmines (APLS) and Small Arms

India remains fully committed to the eventual elimination of AntiPersonnel Mines (APLs). The current humanitarian tragedy of antipersonnel mines has been caused by their illegal and irresponsible
exports and indiscriminatory use. India has always refrained from
exporting APLs and is of the view that the individual moratoria on
exports should be strengthened by developing a universal agreement
that would ban such exports and transfers. India is not a party to the
Ottawa Convention because our own legitimate security concerns
require us, in view of long land border, to make use of APLs in a
purely defensive mode. Indias responsible use of APLs has been
universally acknowledged, including by the ICRC. India is a major
contributor to UN demining efforts since its participation in the
Congo peace keeping operations in 1963. Experts from the Indian
Armys Corps of Engineers have been associated with UN demining
efforts in Angola, Rwanda, Mozambique, Somalia and most recently
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
India is a party to the Protocol - II of the Inhumane Weapons
Convention and was actively involved in strengthening this Protocol
during the 1995-96 negotiations. Indias instruments of Ratification
on Amended Protocol - II on Anti-Personnel Landmines and
Protocol-IV on Blinding Laser Weapons were deposited with the
UN Secretary General on 2 September 1999. India put forward the
idea of a complete ban on use of APLs in situations other than
international armed conflict but this suggestion did not enjoy
agreement among all the countries. India had also made suggestions

Annual Report 1999-2000

for banning Remotely Delivered Mines (RDMS) as well as a complete
ban on all transfers of APLs and IEDs (Improvised Explosive
Devices). These proposals still remain on the table and India hopes
that they will enjoy greater support at the forthcoming meeting in
mid-December.
The First Annual Conference of States Parties to the Amended
Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW) was held in Geneva, 15-17 December 1999. The Conference
adopted a declaration calling on all States that have not done so to
ratify Amended Protocol II as soon as possible. India participated
actively in this Conference. While reiterating its commitment to the
objective of the total elimination of landmines, India supported a
phased approach that would balance the humanitarian considerations
arising from an indiscriminate use of landmines on one hand, and
their use for legitimate purposes of self-defence by States.
During the past decade, the issue of small arms proliferation has
become a major concern. These weapons have become more portable
and at the same time more lethal. Non-state actors such as terrorists,
drug smugglers and organised crimes syndicates find it easy to procure
these weapons and use it against civil societies and law enforcement
agencies. India has a strict arms licensing policy with production of
small arms and ammunition being undertaken in ordnance factories.
Proliferation of these weapons during the Afghanistan war had led
to large quantities of such weapons being smuggled into India in
order to perpetrate the low intensity conflict and step up acts of
terrorism and violence. India has repeatedly called for concerted
international efforts to stem illegal manufacturing and trafficking of
small arms and explosives. India has welcomed the call for an
international conference in 2001 and remain actively engaged in the
negotiations of a Firearms Protocol as part of the Convention on
Transnational Organised Crime.

Bilateral Dialogue on Confidence Building Measures
(CBMs); ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)

Indias approach to confidence building has unilateral, bilateral
and regional aspects. The Bilateral Confidence Building Measures
(CBMS) have been negotiated both in the India-Pakistan and the
Sino-Indian context. With Pakistan, conventional CBMs were sought
to be supplemented with nuclear and missile related CBMs in the
framework of the MOU signed between the Foreign Secretaries of
the two countries at the February 1999 Lahore Summit. The agreement
also envisaged updating of conventional CBMs in the light of new
realities. However, Pakistans aggression in Kargil constitutes a setback
to this process.
As regards China, the brief hiatus in dialogue post-May 1998 is
now over. India and China have agreed to begin a security dialogue
following the visit of the External Affairs Minister to China. India
and China have a number of conventional CBMs in place. India would
be prepared to enter into bilateral restraint arrangements also in the
nuclear field taking into account the unilateral commitment of both
countries to no-first-use.
At the Asia-Pacific level, the only arrangement for a regional
security dialogue is the ASEAN Regional Forum. ARF has been
focussing on building confidence and trust and has built a basket of
proposals on CBMS, which can be negotiated. External Affairs
Minister led the Indian delegation to the 6th ARF meeting held in
Singapore on July 26, 1999. The meeting was followed by PostMinisterial Conferences (PMC) with the ASEAN. The ARF/PMC
meetings provided an opportunity for a wide range of bilateral contacts
including with the US, China, Japan, Russia and some ASEAN
countries. Unlike the ARF Meet in Manila last year when nuclear
testing by India was in focus, there was no discussion on India-specific
issues. There was a general reference in the Chairpersons statement
issued at the end of the meeting for states that had tested nuclear
81

United Nations and International Organisations

weapons last year to exercise restraint, including by adherence to the
CTBT. In our bilateral contacts, Indias restraint on Kargil was
appreciated and the Chairpersons statement endorsed our stand on
bilateralism. Officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and the
Ministry of Defence continued to participate in the inter-sessional
meetings of the Forum.
Environment and Sustainable Development Issues
The Seventh Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable
Development (CSD), established by the ECOSOC to review progress

Summit, 1992), was held from April 19-30, 1999. The main themes
were Tourism, Changing Consumption and Production Patterns,
Oceans and Seas, and, Small Island Developing States - Programme
of Action. The issue of oceans governance was a major point of

would be a more comprehensive review of oceans-related matters by
the UN General Assembly, which will be the sole forum in which
coordination of oceans issues will take place.
The VIIth Meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP-VII) of
the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands was held in San Jose, Costa
Rica from May 10 to 18, 1999. Among the issues before the
Conference was the question of adoption of guidelines for (a)
integrating wetlands conservation and wise use into river-basin
management and (b) for international cooperation under the
Convention. The Indian delegation actively participated in the
negotiations and ensured that Indias concerns were adequately
addressed, including by stipulating that the implementation of these
guidelines is to be in accordance with the national plans and priorities.
The meeting of the Subsidiary Bodies of the Convention on
Climate Change was held in Bonn from May 29 - June 11, 1999 to

was preceded by a meeting of the Group of 77 and China on May 2930, 1999, at which India was appointed as the Coordinator and the
Spokesman of the Group on mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol.
The meeting agreed that the priority should be accorded to the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), one of the three flexibility
mechanisms under the Protocol. The Group also agreed on a paper
outlining its perspectives on the CDM, which was submitted to the
5th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) which met in Bonn from October 25November 5, 1999.
The 5th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Bonn from October 25November 5, 1999. It considered the implementation of the Buenos
Aires Plan of Action and in this context decided to have additional
meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies to help COP VI in arriving at
decisions as set out in the Plan of Action. In addition to its position
paper on the Mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, G-77 and China
had tabled before COP V, additional papers on two of the Mechanisms,
viz , the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Emissions
Trading were tabled. India played a leading role in the meeting of G77 and China in this regard. The Conference also decided to authorise
the consolidation of a text for further negotiations on the Mechanisms
so as to be ready for adoption at COP VI.
Economic And Social Commission For Asia And The Pacific

The most important event relating to Economic And Social
Commission For Asia And The Pacific (ESCAP) from Indias point
of view was the Second Ministerial Conference on Space Applications
for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific held in New

served as an excellent exposition of Indias achievements in the use
of space systems towards sustainable development and showcased
Indias capabilities for sharing its experience with other countries in
the region. The Delhi Declaration on Space Technology Applications
in Asia and the Pacific, unanimously adopted at the Conference, is a
landmark in regional cooperation with particular emphasis on national
capacity building and enhancing the regional capability in space
technology applications, through the participation of countries of
the Asia Pacific region.
In addition, there was the annual ESCAP Commission Session
held in April 1999 and the regular intergovernmental and other
Committee meetings, in which the delegations from India participated
actively .

a major role to play as one of the two Vice-Chairmen. The 54th
session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the
basis of these recommendations. The text of the resolution on
financing for Development was satisfactory from Indias view point
as it preserves the outcome of the preparatory process thus far and
sets in place a similar process on substantive matters. The Conference
on Financing For Development to be held in 2001 is expected to be
a high-level inter-governmental event, with ministerial level
participation.

Session was held from July 5-30, 1999 in Geneva. The ECOSOC
considered the reports of its various subsidiary bodies in the fields of
economic and environmental matters and social and human rights
questions. The high level segment during the session focussed on the
theme - the role of employment and work in poverty eradication: the
empowerment and advancement of women. The Ministerial

poverty eradication and employment generation.

Assembly to review the implementation of the Programme of Action
(POA) of the 1994 International Conference on Population and

tension, leading to further conflict and confrontation.
India was an active participant in the 27th International
Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent held from October
31 to November 6,1999. India contributed actively to drafting of the

rules regarding grant of special protection to cultural property more
liberal. A simplified regime is expected to provide more flexibility
regarding the eligibility of cultural property to become specially
protected. Once a property is placed under special protection then
any violation of such property either by using it for military purposes
or making such property an object of attack will be treated as a serious
violation. This puts an obligation on the Parties either to try or
extradite the offender. The Protocol, also prohibits acts of hostility
directed against any cultural property and puts an obligation on states

necessity has been retained and the Protocol lists out the conditions

military necessity.

Foreign Economic Relations

Economic Division

T

he year 1999-2000 saw a significant improvement in the global
economic situation. The financial crisis that plagued the world
in 1998 and 1999 definitely bottomed out. The East Asian
region came out of recession through disciplined macro-economic
policies and structural reforms. The growth in the world economy is
set to gain moderate strength in the coming years. It may, however,
be necessary for governments to resist pressures from special interest
groups to take protectionist measures, as such measures may be
counterproductive and undermine a promising economic
environment.
The launch of the EURO on 1 January 1999 to replace the national
currencies of eleven countries of the European Union (EU) was a
major step taken by the EU towards economic integration. The EURO
was expected to enable the EU to exert a greater influence over the
direction of the world economy.
Indias trade and economic relations with other countries
continued to expand during the year. Efforts by the Ministry and
Indian Missions abroad to promote foreign trade and Indian
investment abroad continued. Indias total exports amounted to
Rs.1416 billion during April 1998 - March 1999 as against Rs.1301

90

billion during April 1997 - March 1998. The exports from the country
during April 1999 - July 1999 stood at Rs.474 billion compared to
Rs.417 billion in the corresponding period in 1997-98. The European
Union continued to be Indias principal trading partner. The other
major trading partners were the USA, Japan, China, UAE and Russia.
Major commodities of Indias exports included agricultural and allied
products, marine products, iron ore, leather goods, gems & jewellery,
chemicals and related products, engineering goods, electronic goods
and textiles.
Export promotion activities such as organizing and participating
in trade fairs, exhibitions and seminars both at home and abroad
continued. Besides the annual India International Trade Fair held in
New Delhi in November 1999, the 13th India Engineering Trade
Fair organized by the Confederation of Indian Industries in New
Delhi in February 1999 with the Republic of Korea as the partner
country, a seminar-cum-exhibition on technology in electronics
organized by the Department of Electronics in New Delhi in February
1999 and an India International Maritime Expo in Goa in October
1999 supported by the Ministry of Surface Transport were some of
the notable trade promotion events held in India. The Ministry
sponsored a Made in India Show along with the Confederation of
Indian Industry in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in August 1999. A trade

Annual Report 1999-2000

fair in Panama City in March 1999, an international trade fair in Athens
in September 1999, the Israel Agritech Exhibition 1999 in Haifa also
in September 1999, and the International Leather Goods Fair at Messe
Oftenbach, Germany were some of the exhibitions abroad in which
Indian Missions abroad played a very significant role.
India continued to encounter certain problems in the area of
exports, such as the European Unions anti-dumping/anti-subsidy
cases against Indian products. India has been one of the most targetted
countries for trade defence instruments like anti-dumping duties. Antidumping/anti-subsidy investigations were mainly directed towards
textiles, pharmaceuticals and iron and steel sectors where Indian
exports are competitive. India shared the first position with China
for the largest number of cases since 1994, with 22 investigations
each out of a total of 175. Out of the 29 new investigations initiated
in 1998, India shared the top position with South Korea with 7 cases
each. Of the provisional measures in 30 cases in 1998, India was
again the country affected by the largest number of cases, namely
seven.
The Ministry has worked closely with the Ministries of Labour,
Commerce and Textiles on the issue of child labour, and in the setting
up of the mechanism by the Ministry of Labour for the investigation
of complaints relating to the use of illegal child labour in the export
consignments of goods such as hand made carpets.
India has also been facing some difficulties in the matter of export
of textiles to the countries of the European Union (EU). While the
Memorandum of Understanding on Textiles signed by India and the
EU on 31 December 1994 provides for the grant of exceptional
flexibilities by the EU for better utilisation of quotas, the EU has not
granted such flexibilities in 1998 and 1999. The Ministry has been
working closely with the Ministry of Textiles on this issue. The matter
has been taken up with the European Commission and the EU
national governments and is being actively pursued.

The Ministry continued to support and encourage Indian
investment abroad with a view to promoting Indias economic
cooperation with other countries. In 1999-2000, the Ministry cleared
241 proposals for the setting up of Joint Ventures/ Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries abroad. The Ministry has been responding positively to
the Reserve Bank of Indias proposals with regard to simplification
of procedures for Indian investment overseas. Indias important
investment destinations were the USA, UK, UAE, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Engineering and
construction, software, telecom, textiles and allied produces, chemicals
and pharmaceuticals, leather and rubber products, iron and steel,
consultancy and trading and marketing were some of the notable
areas of collaboration. The Ministry has been working closely with
various governmental and other bodies in the matter of promoting
overseas exports and investment. It is represented in the Governing
Bodies of OCCI, ITPO, IRCON Ltd, WAPCOS and ONGC Videsh Ltd.
Exchanges between India and other countries on economic
related matters at official and unofficial levels continued. The Second
India-UK Annual Talks on International Economic & Financial issues
took place in London in May 1999. The third round of dialogue
between the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of
International Trade & Industry (MITI) of the Government of Japan
was held in Tokyo in February 1999. Shri Jaswant Singh, Minister of
External Affairs, paid an official visit to Japan from 23-27 November
1999. He had discussions with his counterpart and others in the
Japanese Government on several bilateral matters including IndiaJapan economic relations. An economic commission sponsored by
the MITI of Japan proposes to visit India shortly to study and examine
the avenues of investment. A meeting of the India-Japan Joint Business
Council is also proposed to be held in the near future. There also
have been visits of commercial and industrial delegations from India
to other countries and from the other countries to India .
91

Foreign Economic Relations

Exchanges took place between India and other developing
countries in the area of technical training under the Colombo Plan
and the Technical Cooperation Programmes. Under these
programmes Government of India nominees participated in training
programmes in Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore in such fields as
health, family planning, environment, urban development, housing,
quality control, irrigation and drainage engineering and taxation.
Following Indias nuclear tests in May 1998, some countries
imposed certain restrictive economic measures against India. The
Government of India had explained the rationale behind the nuclear
tests and has been continuing the of dialogue with key interlocutors
with regard to the withdrawal of the restrictive measures. The USA
has recently announced relaxation of a number of restrictive economic
measures against India. Exercising the authority given to him under
the Defence Appropriation Act passed by the US legislature in
October 1999, the US President waived, for an indefinite period,
restrictive measures against India in respect of the following:
i)

Activities and programmes of the Export-Import Bank (EXIM
Bank)

ii) Activities and programmes of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC)
iii) Assistance under the International Military Education and
Training Programme (IMET)
iv) The making of any loan or the providing of any credit to the
Government of India by any US bank
v) Assistance to the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund, the
Rhinoceros and Tiger conservation Fund, and the Indo-American
Environmental Leadership programme and
vi) Any credit, credit guarantee, or other financial assistance provided
by the Department of Agriculture to support the purchase of
food or other agricultural commodity.

Multilateral Economic Relations
The year under review witnessed an improvement in the global
economic situation. Although still undergoing some post-crisis
symptoms, there were definite signs of recovery in South-East Asian
countries like Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand where various strict
fiscal and economic measures were rigorously implemented. Most
multilateral groupings focussed on ways and means to prevent
recurrence of crisis-like situations in the future. Besides questioning
the validity of blind adherence to globalisation, they also focussed on
critical issues like reform of the international financial architecture
and containment of social impact of future crises. During such
deliberations, it was generally acknowledged that the cure to the
economic malaise would require active collaboration between the
developed and developing countries.
India played an active role during the deliberations of various
multilateral and regional groupings like the Group of 15 (G-15), Group
of 77 (G-77), Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
and Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IORARC). The Ministry of External Affairs monitored such developments
and actively participated in all such deliberations in the light of our
long-term national interests. Further, the Ministry, through its various
Missions abroad, collaborated with other GOI Departments and
agencies in promoting foreign business investment and presence in
India in important infrastructural sectors like power, information
technology, telecom, etc.
Similarly, in various international fora, India pointed out that
globalisation has not led to economic growth or increased the per
capita incomes in many developing countries. In order for it to become
sustainable, the globalization process would have to give due regard
to the economic development objectives of developing countries. The
shortfall in the flow of official development assistance as also the

Annual Report 1999-2000

inherent shortcomings of private financial flows would have to be
remedied. Accordingly, the international community would have to
address three fundamental issues - a stable level of financial flows to
developing countries, initiatives to reincorporate world economic
growth, and consultations for the design of a new financial
architecture.
Besides the above issues, during the latter part of 1999, the
multilateral circuit was largely dominated by discussions on the World
Trade Organization (WTO) issues of mutual concern, which were
taken up at the third WTO Ministerial Conference at Seattle. EAM
met Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, United States Trade
Representative, in Paris on 26 May 1999. During the meeting, the
External Affairs Minister (EAM) reiterated Indias principled position
on various areas of importance in the context of the WTO, including
the proposed Millennium Round, Industrial Tariffs, Agreement on
Agriculture and Information Technology Agreement - II.
The Ministry contributed tangibly to the preparatory process for
the Seattle Ministerial by ascertaining positions of important WTO
members through its Missions. Besides participating in the interministerial exercise to finalise Indias strategy for the Seattle Meeting,
Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also collaborated with the Ministry
of Commerce in organizing a G-15 Ministerial Meeting at Bangalore
in August 1999 in preparation for the Third WTO Ministerial
Conference at Seattle. MEA officials also participated in the G-77
Ministerial Meeting held at Marrakech, Morocco, in September 1999
where a message was issued by the G-77 Ministers to the Third WTO
Ministerial Conference about the concerns of developing countries.

in Uruguay Round Agreements on Anti-Dumping, Subsidies, TRIPs,
operationalization of Special and Differential Treatment provisions,
etc. Under the Agreement on Agriculture, India maintained that it
was important not only to reduce subsidies on agricultural exports
but also to focus on concerns of developing countries in matters
such as food security, rural employment, etc. India was however, willing
to show flexibility in areas such as e-commerce and information
technology.
The ASEAN-India Dialogue Partnership received a further fillip
with Indias participation led by EAM in the 32nd ASEAN Post
Ministerial Conference (PMC) in Singapore on 27-28 July 1999.
Besides participating in the multilateral plenary sessions, EAM also
had bilateral meetings with Ministers from some ASEAN and
Dialogue Partner countries. In his detailed intervention on the
international economic and financial situation, he mentioned that due
attention would have to be paid to the specific priorities of each
country in order to make globalisation a more humane and equitable
process.
Indias bilateral exchanges with ASEAN were also most rewarding.
ASEAN conveyed appreciation for the support given by India to
various activities in ongoing areas of cooperation through mechanisms
such as the ASEAN-India Fund to which India, contributes to the

At the Seattle Ministerial Conference of WTO, India categorically
rejected any attempts to link trade with labour, or trade with
environment. India also emphasized the need to take remedial action
on implementation issues pertaining to asymmetries and inequities

Foreign Economic Relations

Dr. Mohamed Ariff, Executive Director of the Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research, Kuala Lumpur and H.E. Mr. Soubanh Srithirath,
Minister from Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, delivered lectures
in India in May and November 1999 respectively. Similarly, eminent
Indian educationist, Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan delivered lectures in Malaysia
and Indonesia in September 1999.
India remained an active participant in the Group of 15 (G-15).
G-15 representatives met at the Senior Officials and the Ministerial
level on 22 & 24 September 1999 on the margins of the United Nations
General Assembly (UNGA). Egypt, current G-15 Chair, led the
discussions. During their deliberations, G-15 leaders exchanged views
on the prospects of adopting a common G-15 position on matters of
mutual interest for the Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference (30
November - 3 December 1999), the 10th G-15 Summit in Cairo in
May 2000 and the steps taken for initiating a G-15 - G-8 dialogue as
decided at the IX G-15 Summit in Jamaica.
A GOI delegation participated in the meeting of G-15 Experts
on the Financial Crisis and the Reform of the International Financial
Architecture held in Cairo from 23-24 October, 1999. The meeting
offered a useful opportunity for interaction on important issues such
as capital account liberalization, monetary management and foreign
debt, strengthening of the banking system, role of monetary and fiscal
policy in financial markets, good governance, social safety nets, early
warning mechanisms and review of the role of credit rating agencies.
An Indian delegation also participated in the G-15 Symposium on
Globalization and its Economic and Social Impacts  A South
Perspective held at Cairo on 22-23 November 1999, and presented
an important paper on Globalization and the Trade of Developing
Countries. The discussions focussed on various aspects of
globalization such as the world economic and social environment
and the process of globalization and liberalization, transnational
corporations, capital markets, trade of developing countries, social
impact of globalization, etc.
94

India participated in the South-South forum of G-77 Ministerial
Meeting on 24 September 1999 on the margins of UNGA. The G-77
adopted a Ministerial Declaration which covers the global economic
situation highlighting issues such as globalization and interdependence,
international trade matters as evolving in the WTO, financing for
development, Official Development Assistance (ODA) and the
external debt of developing countries, environment, science and
technology, etc. The meeting also adopted a statement on the
forthcoming South Summit to be held in Havana, Cuba in April 2000.
The G-77 Ministerial Declaration followed up on the G-77 Ministerial
Meeting held in Marrakech, Morocco from 14-16 September 1999.
The Marrakech Meeting discussed preparatory action for the Tenth
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTADX) to be held in Bangkok in February 2000, as well as the WTO
Ministerial Conference in Seattle. Multilateral trade issues, as
highlighted in the Marrakech Declaration, were reiterated in the G77 Ministerial Meeting in New York.
India participated actively in the grouping of Indian Ocean Rim
Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). A high-level
Indian delegation, led by External Affairs Minister, participated in
the Second IOR-ARC Ministerial Meeting, which was held in Maputo,
Mozambique from 30-31 March 1999. The Ministerial Meeting was
preceded by a Seminar on Trade & Investment in IOR-ARC Region
held on 26-27 March 1999, and a meeting of the Committee of Senior
Officials on 28-29 March 1999. Mozambique will chair IOR-ARC
meetings until 2001, when, Oman - after convening of the Third
IOR-ARC Ministerial meeting in Muscat in 2001  will assume
Chairmanship of the grouping.
The IOR-ARC Ministerial Meeting decided to expand the
Associations membership by admitting five new members, namely
Bangladesh, Iran, Seychelles, Thailand and United Arab Emirates.

Annual Report 1999-2000

The Ministerial Meeting also decided to extend Dialogue Partner status
to Egypt and Japan. The IOR-ARC Ministers met again in New York
in September 1999 on the margins of UNGA session for discussions
on the IOR-ARC Extraordinary Meeting of Ministers in Oman in
January 2000 and other IOR-ARC issues.
A meeting of Experts of IOR-ARC was held at Maputo on 8-10
December 1999 to finalize three draft documents for the grouping Instrument of Acceptance, Rules of Procedure, and a Headquarters
Agreement between the Government of Mauritius and the IOR-ARC
Coordinating Secretariat. A clause requiring all new members to extend
Non-discriminatory (MFN) trade treatment to all members of the
grouping was incorporated in the Instrument of Acceptance. All the
three documents were considered and approved by the Special Meeting
of the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO) and the Extraordinary
Meeting of the Council of Ministers held at Muscat, Oman from 2023 January 2000. The meeting also considered and approved dialogue
partnership status for UK and China. No consensus emerged on the
French application for membership. In case of Pakistan, the Council
of Ministers decided that membership would be considered upon its
adhering to non-discriminatory trade treatment to all members of
IOR-ARC and signing the Instrument of Acceptance.
The first meeting of the IOR-ARC Working Group on Trade
and Investment was also held on 20 January 2000 at Muscat prior to
the CSO meeting to discuss issues of trade facilitation, trade
promotion, technical cooperation among members.
India took active interest in the sub-regional grouping called
Bangladesh  India  Myanmar  Sri Lanka  Thailand Economic
Cooperation (BIMST-EC). A GOI delegation participated in the
BIMST-EC Preparatory Meeting for the Establishment of an
Economic Forum (8-9 November, 1999) and Trade and Investment
Sectoral Committee (10 November 1999) convened by the

Government of Bangladesh at Dhaka. The Economic Forum would
provide strategic leadership in initiating economic activities to benefit
the group, facilitate implementation of development projects, develop
mechanisms for greater private sector involvement in BIMST-EC
activities, enhance quality of information flows and promote
institutional linkages and networking, and generate increased
participation by the business community in the identified sectors of
BIMST-EC. India would be participating in the BIMST-EC meeting
of Experts in Energy Sector being convened by Myanmar on 28-29
February 2000.
The Sectoral Committee on Trade and Investment discussed the
critical role of information flows (on trade and investment matters)
within BIMST-EC member countries and the networking of private
sector agencies/institutions and investment promotion agencies of
member countries. India proposed setting up a BIMSTNet on the
Internet.
India also hosted a World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) Sub-Regional Forum on Intellectual Property Rights among
BIMST-EC Countries in New Delhi on 18-19 November 1999. In
order to give greater impetus to cooperation in this area, the meeting
proposed that it would be desirable to officially include Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) as a sub-sector of cooperation under the trade
and investment sector in BIMST-EC. The meeting stressed the critical
role which Information Technology could play in facilitating IPRrelated cooperation under BIMST-EC and stressed the need to
intensify linkages between IPR-related institutions in member
countries.
Besides participating in the deliberations of various regional
economic and multilateral groupings, the Ministry also associated itself
with various other international economic conferences and seminars.
A high-level Indian delegation led by EAM participated in the bilateral
95

Foreign Economic Relations

India-United Kingdom (UK) talks on International Economic and
Financial Issues held on 24 May 1999 in London. The talks provided
an opportunity to both the countries to review the present state of
UK and Indian economies, bilateral economic relations, and global
economic issues of significance.
EAM visited Paris to participate in a special dialogue between
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Council of Ministers and selected non-member countries, held at Paris
on 26 May 1999. Other non-member countries which were invited
were Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian
Federation, the Slovak Republic and South Africa. The meeting
provided an opportunity for the 29 member countries of OECD to
discuss policy coherence on a range of key economic issues, with
important non-member countries, representing a population of over
3 billion people and a rising share of the global GDP.
The Ministry played an active coordinating role in the Economic
and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Projects of
Trans Asian Railway and Asian Highway. A 4-member Indian
delegation comprising representatives of the Ministry of Railways,
the Ministry of External Affairs, and Container Corporation of India
(CONCOR) participated in the meeting for development of TransAsian Railway - Southern Corridor (TAR-SC), convened by ESCAP
in Dhaka on 25-28 May 1999.
In the context of South-South cooperation, a GOI delegation
participated in the 11th Session of High Level Committee (HLC) on
the Review of Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries
(TCDC), held at New York from 1-4 June 1999. The HLC mechanism,
which has been created by the UN General Assembly, pursuant to
the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) on TCDC in 1978, meets
every two years. Participation in the meeting provided an excellent
96

opportunity for reiterating Indias active involvement with the TCDC
cause. Indias statement was widely circulated within participant
countries along with other information booklets on the ITEC
programme. India announced the establishment of a specific Trust
Fund for beneficiaries in Africa, Latin America and South Pacific
countries.
Solidarity with Africa continues to be one of Indias main planks
of its multilateral economic relations diplomacy. Thus, India
participated in the Regional Review Meeting of the Tokyo Agenda
for Action - finalized at the Second Tokyo International Conference
on African Development (TICAD) at Tokyo in October 1998 - held
in Lusaka, Zambia from 23-25 November 1999. The Indian delegate
gave an overview of the initiatives being undertaken by India for the
economic development of Africa, both at a bilateral level under the
Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) Programme,
and in other multilateral fora such as the G-15, Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Special Commonwealth African
Assistance Plan (SCAAP), Economic and Technical Cooperation
among Developing Countries (ECDC/TCDC), Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). During the
conference, India conveyed its willingness to partner with developed
countries like Japan for developmental initiatives in Africa on a case
by case basis. Under such triangular cooperation, Indian experts could
collaborate in development-oriented projects funded by developed
countries in select areas such as information technology, agriculture,
small-scale industries, public health and education. India also
highlighted the potential for strengthening some of the Indian
institutions and centres of excellence imparting HRD training in
various fields to African candidates through assistance by developed
countries.

used by the end of this financial year. The number of Training
Institutes has been increased to 51 after empanelling 12 new Institutes
in the current financial year in response to needs expressed by our
partner countries. The new Institutes cover fields such as Drugs and
Pharmaceuticals, Labour Administration and Employment Relations
in a global Economy, Hotel Management, Oceanography, Artificial
Insemination, Telecommunications, Sugarcane Production
Technology, Wildlife Management, Remote Sensing, etc. Regular
courses were conducted in the usual fields of Audit and Accounts,
Banking, Diplomacy, Manpower Planning, Parliamentary Studies,
Rural Development, Small Scale Industries, Information Technology,
Food Processing, Textile Technology, News Agency Journalism,
Standardisation, Educational Planning and Administration,
Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development, Packaging,
International Management, Human Resource Planning and English
Language. Under ITEC Civil Training Programme all costs including
international travel are borne by the GOI.

ITEC has created considerable goodwill for India and helped
boost her image as a country with indigenous technological skills and
capabilities who shares her knowledge and experience with other
developing countries without any strings attached. There has been a
growing demand for ITEC assistance from partner countries. From
actual expenditure of Rs. 22.69 crores in 1997-98, the programmes
budget grew to Rs. 34.29 crores in 1998-99. The budget allocation
for 1999-2000 has been enhanced to Rs. 36.00 crores.

For the first time in 1999-2000, neighbouring countries, Nepal,
Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Myanmar were allotted
slots under ITECs Civil Training Programme. Utilisation of these
slots is, however, uneven; while Sri Lanka and Maldives have utilised
the entire allocation, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar have not so
far been able to utilise the slots to the extent desired. We expect the
utilisation to improve as information about the offer percolates better
into the system next year.

In 1999-2000, 1967 slots were allotted for Civil training (as against
1485 in 1998-99) in prestigious Training Institutes and Establishments
(Annexure-XIII) including 240 slots allotted to 24 Pacific, CARICOM
and Central American States under a newly created window for
technical cooperation with these countries. Until now 1067 slots have
been utilised (Annexure-XIV and XV) and more are expected to be

Under Military Training, nominees of friendly countries are
imparted training in national institutions in all three wings of defence
services, including the prestigious National Defence College, New
Delhi and National Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. The
Training covers fields such as Security and Strategic Studies; Defence
Management; Artillery; Electronics, Mechanical, Marine and

Technical Cooperation
The Technical Cooperation Division offers technical assistance
under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC)
Programme and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan
(SCAAP) to 141 developing countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America,
Eastern Europe and the Pacific. For the purposes of this report,
reference to ITEC will also include SCAAP (under which only civil
training is provided) as the two programmes are different only in
budget heads under which accounts are maintained.
The ITEC assistance takes the following four forms:
i)

Training (both civil and military).

ii) Projects and project-related assistance such as supply of
equipment, consultancy services and feasibility studies.
iii) Deputation of experts and

Aeronautical Engineering; Anti-marine Warfare; Hydrographic;
Logistics and Management and Qualitative Assurance Services.
All Military training costs, including international travel, for
ITEC-I category candidates are met by GOI. For ITEC-II category
candidates, costs are partially covered under ITEC and partially
(international travel ) shared with the partner country. During 1999 2000, 195 slots for long and short term training courses were offered
under ITEC/SAP and 140 slots under Self-Financing Scheme. Some
slots were also offered on reciprocal basis. Annexures XVI- XIX
contain lists of beneficiary countries of ITEC Military Training
Programme.
Projects and project related assistance has helped enhance Indias
image as a modern economy and technologically and scientifically
advanced State. In 1999 - 2000, a project was launched to establish a
Plastic Technology Demonstration and Common Facility Centre in
the backward area of Ondangwa (located about 800 kms. from
Windhoek) in Namibia at a total cost of approximately Rs. 3.40 crores.
NSIC is the Implementing Agency for this project. The Centre will
provide vocational skills to the youth of Namibia and enhance
employment opportunities for them. Another project costing
approximately Rs.13 crores for setting up an Entrepreneurship and
Technical Development Centre (ETDC) in Senegal, started in 1998
by HMT(I), is expected to be completed in January/February, 2000.
Envisaged in the long run as a Regional Centre for all the French
speaking West African countries, ETDC provides vocational training
to 96 students in selected mechanical and electronic trades. After a
midterm review of the project was conducted by Additional Secretary
(FA) and Joint Secretary (TC), the Ministry of National Education,
Government of Senegal decided to confer National Diploma to each
student passing out from the Centre which will be recognised not
only in Senegal but also in other franco-phone countries in West
Africa.

The Indian Farmers Project in Burkina Faso aimed at transferring
Indian Green Revolution technology, particularly in rice cultivation
to Burkina Faso was also launched this year. This is a unique project
under which six practical farmers from Punjab have been sent to
Burkina Faso for three years to implement the project. Farm
machinery, equipment and other inputs have also been supplied by
the GOI. In fulfilment of a high-level commitment, equipment for
setting up five primary health centres was also supplied this year to
Burkina Faso. In Mongolia, where ITEC had set up the Rajiv Gandhi
Vocational Training Centre (RGVTC) in September 1996, two
additional faculties i.e. Computer Programming and Gem Stone
Cutting and Polishing were provided this year, to augment the existing
five faculties (auto mechanic, radio and TV repair, plumbing, electrician
and machine shop mechanics). These two additional faculties were
inaugurated by the Honble Vice President of India during his visit to
Mongolia in August 1999. Smaller projects, feasibility studies and
consultancy services were undertaken in countries such as Myanmar,
Kyrghyzstan, Guyana, Cambodia and Fiji. A list of projects and
project-related assistance extended this year so far to different
countries may be seen at Annexure XX.
Under the much sought after Study Visits Programme, senior
decision makers from various partner countries are invited to India
for exchange of views and guided exposure to Indian capacities in
fields of interest to them such as small scale industries, agriculture,
health, education, foreign-trade, etc. Twenty study visits were planned
this year as against 10-11 in previous years. Manpower constraints in
TC Division were overcome by engaging the services of retired Deputy
Secretary / Director level officers of the Ministry to act as Liaison
Officers for the visiting delegations. A 2-member delegation led by
Mr. Yura Jigj, Director, Rajiv Gandhi Vocational Training Centre
(RGVTC), Ulaanbaatar, visited India from 19 - 25 June, 1999 to see
Computer Programming and Gem & Jewellery Processing facilities

Annual Report 1999-2000

in India and to discuss with the officials in the Ministry of Education
the possibilities of cooperation in the education field. A 2-member
team from Suriname led by Mr. S F Polanen, Chairman of the Electoral
Council of Suriname, visited India from 18 - 23 September, 1999 to
study Indias electoral process. Dr. Haseeb Bashi, Director General,
Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, visited
India from October 25 - 29, 1999 to select books in engineering,
technology, science, etc. which are proposed to be supplied to Iraq
under ITEC Programme. A 3-member delegation from Turkmenistan
led by H.E. Mr. N U Utamyshev, Deputy Minister of Textiles, visited
India from November 14 - 21, 1999 to study and discuss possible
cooperation in textile industry. Mr. M. Y. C. Lumbanga, Chief Secretary
of Tanzania visited India from December 14-20, 1999 to study the
industrial and technological progress made by India. Other study visits
are scheduled this year from Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Uganda and
Seychelles.
Indian experts are deputed abroad as advisors in response to
requests received from Governments of developing countries for
advice on technical and developmental subjects such as health,
agriculture, engineering, teaching, accounts, small scale industries and
legislation drafting. Over the years Indian experts have effected
incremental improvement in vital developmental sectors of the
economies of many countries with their well considered advice which
is generally respected for being most relevant to the needs and
capacities of the developing economies. Expenses on deputing experts
are shared with the host country although the larger share is borne
by the GOI. The number of experts until 1998-99 was 23 but there

are plans to raise this number to 50 to meet the growing demand.
Through the valuable cooperation and support of the Department
of Personnel and Training, we have been able to reduce our response
time taken to send an expert abroad. At present there are 22 long
term and 1 short term experts (Annexure XXI) in Guyana, Laos,
Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, Trinidad & Tobago, Vietnam, Zambia
and Zanzibar.
In May, 1999 a documentary video film on ITEC Programme
entitled, The South Imperatives of Cooperation was prepared and
shown at New York during the 11th Session of High Level Committee
on TCDC held from June 1-5, 1999. Copies of the video film were
also sent to Indian Missions for use on ITEC Day on 15th September,
1999. The film was well received. In some countries the film was
shown on local TV network.
Under the Aid for Disaster Relief (ADR) Programme
humanitarian assistance for victims of natural disasters in various
countries is provided in the form of medicines, food items, tents,
blankets etc. Under this programme 92 MT of sugar and 500 MT of
rice were supplied to Indonesia/ West Timor while medicines and
surgical items were supplied to Madagascar, Mozambique, Ghana and
Honduras for the victims of a cholera epidemic and floods. Tents
were supplied to Tajikistan in the wake of unseasonal torrential rains
and tea, surgical items and medicines were supplied to Turkey for the
victims of earthquake. The list containing the details of the relief
supplies is at Annexure XXII.

Trade and Investment Promotion

T

he Central Government and the State Governments took
several initiatives and measures during the year aimed at
encouraging foreign investment inflows, particularly the flow
of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India. The major thrust
areas included infrastructure development, particularly energy, power,
telecom and information technology. It was the task of the Investment
Promotion and Publicity Division to actively undertake effective
investment promotion and publicity efforts, particularly through the
Indian Missions and Posts abroad for attracting foreign investment
into the country. Quite often, Commercial Wings in the Missions are
the first point of contact for the foreign investor. It is, therefore,
essential that the Missions are given full backup support in their efforts
in the form of providing up-to-date information about the economy,
the liberalised policies and the procedures, the project and
opportunities available in different sectors, the incentives offered by
the Central Government and various State Governments etc. Missions
are also approached by investors seeking their intervention in case of
delays in respect of clearances for their proposals or in respect of
other hurdles faced in the implementation of projects. For all these
and related matters the Investment Promotion and Publicity (IPP)
Division in the Ministry has acted as a nodal point of contact and
coordination to serve as an effective channel of communication
100

between the Missions and the relevant Ministries/State Governments
or other agencies, as the case may be.
Policy
The Ministry provides inputs for policy formulations, whenever
required, based on investment trends worldwide and based on the
need to maintain harmony between foreign policy objectives and our
economic policies. Regular feedback was received from the Missions
on foreign investor perceptions about Indias investment policies or
about successful model/policies followed elsewhere for serving as
inputs to the evolution of any new policies or to the review of an
existing one, if the same was considered necessary in the national
interest.
The Ministry also actively participated in the meetings of Foreign
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) and Foreign Investment
Implementation Authority (FIIA) in collaboration with other
Ministries and State Governments. In FIPB, the Ministry was
represented by Secretary (ER) and investments from NRIs were given
particular attention. In FIAA, specific policy measures to speed up
the investment already made were taken up with concerned Ministries
and State Governments.

Annual Report 1999-2000

Promotional Efforts and Initiatives
The Ministry undertook several initiatives towards suitably
projecting the various investment policies and announcements of the
Government by coordinating with the Missions on the one hand and
various economic Ministries of the Central Government and State
Governments on the other. Economic news about India was regularly
disseminated to all the Missions highlighting major policy decisions
and new opportunities, thus keeping them abreast of the
developments. Missions were also encouraged to hold investment
promotion seminars and workshops besides extending investment
support services, for which suitable publicity material, speaking points
etc. were regularly despatched. Such seminars were held by several of
our Missions in identified target countries. The Ministry also
undertook special efforts to highlight the policies, procedures and
opportunities available in the Information Technology sector.
The Missions also provided support to visiting Indian delegations
including those sponsored by the State Governments by arranging
suitable meetings with potential investors, local Government officials
and the local Chamber of Commerce or Products Associations.
The Ministry also assisted, based on information provided by
the Missions, visiting foreign investor delegations/groups in having
appropriate meetings with concerned Government Departments, the
Apex Chambers of Commerce, the State Governments etc. The
Ministry also participated in many bilateral or other meetings/
conferences involving overseas investor groups.
The Ministry also actively assisted various Departments/
organisations in the country in organising investment/trade
promotion events in India, including the Ministerial Conference on
Space Applications for Sustainable Development in Asia and Pacific
organised by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission

for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in New Delhi from 15-20 November
1999 and hosted by the Government of India. This Division liaised
with our Missions/Posts abroad for participation of the ESCAP
member countries in the above Conference. Indian and French space
agencies have joined hands to launch a scientific satellite, Megha
Tropiques, which will provide data on atmospheric and oceanic
activities to scientists across the world.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the French
space agency Centre National dEtudes Spatiales (CNES) signed a
statement of intent in New Delhi to launch the satellite in an effort
to understand weather and climate better.
The Government launched a comprehensive scheme for the
persons of Indian origin - called PIO Card Scheme on 30th March.
Under this scheme persons of Indian origin upto the fourth generation
(great grand parents settled through out the world except citizens of
Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries as may be specified by the
Central Government from time to time), would be eligible. The Card
would be issued to eligible applicants through concerned Indian
Embassies/High Commissions/Consulates and for those staying in
India on long-term visa (more than one year), the concerned
Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta,
Chennai) would do the same. The fee for the Card which will have
validity of 20 years, would be US$ 1000. The Ministry actively
participated in the efforts to mobilise good response for the PIO
Card.
Publicity
The IPP Division has reprinted 10,000 copies of its brochure
India Means Business - Perspectives in view of the positive response
received from investors in India and abroad. The Division is also
bringing out the French, German and Spanish versions of this
brochure.
101

Trade and Investment Promotion

The Division is planning to set up a specialised web site on the
internet aimed at foreign business community. It will carry up-todate information on policies and procedures for investment in India,
economic reforms including second generation reforms, economic
data covering investment trends, success stories, interactive section
for business queries and specific projects on offer, etc.
Agreements
The Ministry participated in the negotiations for drawing up of
Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs)

and Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) that were held
in respect of a number of countries. Such agreements were signed
during the year with New Zealand, Trinidad & Tobago, Kyrgyzstan,
Qatar, Indonesia and Zimbabwe.
The Ministry also participated in the negotiations relating to
bilateral Civil Aviation matters with other countries. The Ministry
provided legal inputs, as required, and also tendered advice based on
the need for increased civil aviation links particularly with our
neighbouring regions to evolve in consonance with the initiatives being
taken on the foreign policy front.

Policy Planning and Research

T

he Policy Planning and Research Division of the Ministry
continued to perform its role of preparing briefs and
background papers on important topics and issues on the
evolving international situation. These covered issues of long-term
relevance to broad foreign policy objectives. The Division prepared
analytical position papers for Ministrys interaction with other agencies.
An in-depth paper on Euro prepared in the Division was circulated
in the Ministry and Missions abroad.
The Division continued to serve as a nodal point for interaction
with the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) formerly known
as the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the University Grants
Commission (UGC) and its affiliates and the Area Study Centres
(ASC) located in various universities and specializing in research on
various regions of the world.
The Division extended financial, assistance to various academic
institutions/think tanks located in different parts of the country for
holding conferences, seminars, preparation of research papers,
exchange of scholars and support for Track-II programmes on issues
related to Indias external relations and security.
The subject of these seminars, conferences and research projects
covered Indian Foreign Policy, India-Iran Relations, India-Korea

Dialogue, Indo-US Dialogue, Contribution of Persons of Indian
Origin (PIOs) in the development of countries of their-adoption,
Conference on South Asia, Regional Cooperation among SAARC
Countries. Support was also provided to Indian scholars and experts
attending seminars and conferences in Turkey, Sri Lanka. Singapore,
Kyrghystan, Tajikistan, USA, UK and Canada.
The Centre for Advanced Study of India at the University of
Pennsylvania, USA is given an annual recurring grant by the Division.
A proposal for giving another grant is currently under examination
as a part of the continuing Indo-US cooperation in various fields.
The Division took initiative in promoting exchanges with official
and non-official visiting experts and projected Indias views and
perceptions on important issues. In continuation of this interactive
role, Joint Secretary (PP) led a delegation to Tehran, Iran or the First
Meeting of the Working Group on Research and Study between Iran
and India. During the meeting held on 7th and 8th December 1999
in Tehran, the two sides underlined the importance of research and
study in increasing bilateral cooperation and better understanding of
regional and international issues of mutual interest. It was agreed at
the meeting that:
a) research and study should be carried out on subjects which have
103

Policy Planning and Research

an immediate and direct impact on bilateral relations or issues of
common interest to both countries and
b) experts and scholars from outside the Foreign Ministries should
be engaged in research and study. Apart from holding discussions
on various political issues, science and technology issues were
also discussed under which it was agreed that a dialogue between
the scientific organizations and experts of both countries should
be held at the earliest convenience of both sides to identify specific
areas for cooperation and joint research. Economic and
commercial issues were also discussed wherein it was agreed to
undertake studies on economic complementarities, strengths in
specific sectors, obstacles to trade and economic cooperation
and greater rise of transit routes available under existing
arrangements. During the visit, the Indian delegation also called
on the Deputy Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr. Sadeq Kharrazi and
Deputy Minister for Technology, H.E. Dr. Sayed Ahmad
Motamedi. In view of the fruitful discussions at the First Meeting,
it was agreed that further meetings would be held alternatively in
New Delhi and Tehran at mutually convenient dates.
To further strengthen Ministrys capabilities in research and
analyses, the Division prepared a detailed proposal for revival of the
Research Cadre as recommended by the Parliamentary Standing
Committee on External Affairs. The proposal and Cabinet Note are
in the last stages of being processed and with the revival of this vital
Cadre, it is hoped that our research and analytical capabilities will be
further strengthened to face challenges in formulating our foreign
policy.
The Ambassadors-in-Residence Programme was also revived
with the posting of two Ambassadors  one specializing in Gulf
Studies and the other in Euro-Atlantic Studies. Both Ambassadors
are now attached to the School of International Studies, Jawaharlal
104

Nehru University, New Delhi. Agreements have also been obtained
from the universities of Mumbai, Goa and Delhi for posting of such
Ambassadors-in-Residence and volunteers having the required
qualifications and experiences are awaited for filling tip these posts.
The Division continued to edit and publish the Annual Report
of the Ministry. The Report served as a compendium of Indias
interaction with the rest of the world in the political, economic and
cultural fields, including the views of the government on various facets
of international relations.
The Division rendered all possible assistance to the terrorism
divisions as well as Indian Missions abroad whenever any specific
information or document on international relations was required. The
Research Wing examined the depiction of Indias international
boundaries in foreign publications. Cases of incorrect depiction were
taken up with the concerned government or the publisher through
Indian Missions abroad for necessary corrective measures. The
Division also scrutinized foreign publications containing maps
depicting Indias external boundaries before these were imported into
the county and offered its views to the Ministries dealing with such
matters. It coordinated the supply of map-sheets to various
Government and semi-Government agencies for use in their official
work with the Survey of India and the Ministry of Defence. The
Research Wing dealt with requests from research scholars for access
to the records of the Ministry. A Committee has been constituted
with representatives from the Ministries of External Affairs, Home
Affairs and Defence to examine the access of Research Scholars to
Pre-Independence closed period records in the National Archives
of India.
In support of research, the Ministrys Library has modern
information technology equipment and rich resource materials, with
over one hundred thousand books and a large collection of maps,

Annual Report 1999-2000

microfilms and official documents. The Library receives and maintains
600 periodical titles. It has in-house computer systems with fifteen
terminals, two of which support data entry and retrieval in Hindi. It
also has CD-ROM work station and has CD-ROM databases on
foreign affairs and current affairs. The Library is also equipped with
a CD-writer, a Colour Scanner (with OCR capability as well as facility
for storage and retrieval of images), a microfilm/fiche reader printer,
a plain paper photocopier, as well as a VTR and colour monitor and
a laser printer with Desk Top Publishing (DTP) software. This has
enabled better presentation of publications and documents of the
Division. The Library has internet and E-mail facilities. These are
being gradually made available to visiting users who including former
Foreign Service officers, Documentation/bibliographic services as
well as other library operations and services have been computerised,
using an integrated library software package. Information on all books,
maps, documents and selected periodical articles received in the
Library since 1986, and pre-1986 publications in active use, are
available on-line through each terminal in the as well as in the Ministrys
headquarters in South Block and in Akbar Bhawan through network
in operation in these buildings. Librarys information databases can
also be accessed on internet on MEA Library's websites by eligible
users including our officials in Missions abroad. All new documents
received in the Library  books, maps, microfilms, selected articles
from periodicals  are being fed into the in-house computer system
to create a database on foreign affairs.

Using this database and CD-ROM Databases, the Library
provides Current Awareness Service and Bibliographical and
Reference Services. In addition, the Library regularly issues Foreign
Affairs Documentation Bulletin  monthly list of selected periodicals,

External Publicity

A

s an instrument of foreign policy management, the External
Publicity Division discharges several key functions, namely:
responding to the citizens right to information; articulating
the policies and responses of the government on foreign policy and
international security affairs; projecting a holistic and correct image
of the country; playing the role of a catalyst for enhancing contacts
between Indian media and their counterparts in foreign countries;
dissemination of published information through Indian libraries
abroad; maintaining an internet website with a comprehensive database
and daily updates; and publishing an in-house monthly India
Perspectives in ten languages for wide circulation abroad. A special
responsibility was placed on the XP Division in the summer of 1999
to organise and anchor the inter-ministerial daily briefings to the
national and international media on political and military developments
following Pakistans aggression against India in the Kargil sector of
Jammu and Kashmir. These briefings helped galvanise international
public opinion in support of Indias message that aggression against
India would have to be reversed by Pakistan and that the sanctity and
inviolability of the Line of Control in the Indian State of Jammu and
Kashmir must be respected.
The official spokesman articulated and projected Indias position
on various national and international issues through official

106

statements, press briefings and public relations efforts. Over 200
official statements and press releases were issued by the XP Division
during the period 1999-2000 and circulated to Indian media, foreign
media resident in India, foreign missions in New Delhi and made
available on the ministrys internet website.
The Foreign Affairs Record, a compilation of all press releases,
agreements, speeches and significant diplomatic developments, was
brought out on a monthly basis. Our news dissemination function
also includes daily news bulletins and clippings for headquarters and
missions and posts abroad; regular feedback to missions and posts
on developments concerning India. MEAs internet website serves as
a vital tool in the overall effort towards information dissemination.
Efforts were made jointly with Indian missions and posts abroad
to enlarge areas of positive perception about India. Some focus areas
included: Indias foreign policy and international security approach;
Indias millennial history and civilization; its diverse and profound
religious and philosophical traditions; its democratic and secular
political culture and institutions, its pluralistic, tolerant and progressive
social ethos; its wide experience in nation building; its impressive
economic, scientific and technological achievements and its market
potential.

Annual Report 1999-2000

Audio visual publicity : Documentary and feature films were
used to reinforce the countrys positive image. In the year 1999-2000,
several documentaries on a variety of themes were completed while
others are under various stages of production. These include City
Scapes, Foreigners Who have Adopted India as their Home, Heart of
the Matter (foreign policy show), India & the UN, Wisdom of India,
SAARC in the Next Millennium, Software Frontiers and Coronation

through Indian missions and posts abroad. These include India in
Space, Adoor  A Journey in Frames, Bamboo Flute, Indian Nobel
Laureates, Rooted Imagination, Women in Panchayats, Design Classics
of India, Healing Tree, Heart of the Matter, Echoes from the Past

Nisbat, Of Melodies Divine, and Abiding Grace. On the occasion of
Indias Independence Day  1999, several documentaries were sent
abroad for telecast on local TV networks and international channels.
A positive feedback was received from Indian missions and posts on
these telecasts.
A CD-ROM titled India-Timeless Civilization....Vibrant
Democracy, was brought out by the ministry and its English version
was sent to all missions and posts abroad. The Hindi, Arabic and
Chinese versions are in the final stages of completion, while the
Russian, Spanish and French language versions are also expected to
be completed in the near future. A major exercise was undertaken to
procure and distribute audio and video CDs, representative of the
best of Indian music and cinema, for reference and information.
Film festivals were organized by various missions and posts
abroad and foreign cultural centres in coordination with the ministry.
11 international film festivals, including retrospectives on Ritwik

Ghatak and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, were organized in Paris, Madrid,
Hanoi, Damascus, Glasgow, Cairo, Rome, Copenhagen, Kuala
Lumpur, Mexico City. 49 prints of feature films were supplied from
the XP audio-visual library and other prints were procured from
Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF) and other agencies for this
purpose. Assistance was also provided in facilitating foreign
participation in the 31st International Film Festival in Delhi in January
2000. The division also extended its support in the arrangement of
slide shows and photo-exhibitions in missions and posts abroad.
Requests for information infrastructure and audio-video hardware
from missions and posts were processed. These included sanctioning
of equipment such as satellite antenna, TVs, VCRs, projectors and
photocopiers.
Press facilitation: Foreign media, both print and electronic,
continued to evince keen interest in India through sustained visits.
Indias foreign policy and its approach to security issues, the general
elections and Pakistans aggression in Kargil further stimulated the
medias interest in India. Various facilities were extended by the
Ministry to meet the increased inflow of media persons.
During the year, about 100 journalists, individually or as part of
media and TV delegations visited India from Australia, Austria,
Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Gaza,
Indonesia, Israel, Iran, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Russia,
South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Turkey and Venezuela. These visits
led to a balanced coverage of India in foreign media, as well as to a
better understanding of the country. Many journalistic visits were
unstructured and spontaneous. The division provided assistance to
them, including arranging meetings with senior ministers, high-level
government officials, academicians, representatives of business houses,
industry, etc.
107

External Publicity

Another important aspect of press facilitation work handled by
the division was to provide assistance to foreign media accompanying
Heads of State or Government on visits to India, including those
from Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Estonia, Kazakhsthan,
Kyrghyz Republic, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Qatar,
Russia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Uruguay, Vatican
and Vietnam. The assistance rendered entailed facilitating media
coverage, arranging press briefings and providing other logistical
arrangements. Over 200 journalists, both Indian and foreign, covered
Prime Ministers historic visit to Lahore in February 1999. Another
large media event was the visit by H.H. Pope John Paul II to India in
November 1999.
All logistical arrangements were made for coverage by the Indian
media persons accompanying the President, Vice President and Prime
Minister on their state visits abroad to Jamaica (G-15), Trinidad and
Tobago, Morocco, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mongolia, Kyrghyz Republic,
Austria, Tanzania and South Africa. This included the setting up and
operation of media centres, media briefings and other facilities and
logistical arrangements. Assistance was also provided to Indian
journalists travelling abroad on specific assignments.
The making of documentary films by foreign TV channels was
encouraged and facilitated through timely clearance and administrative
assistance. Around 300 proposals were received from documentary
makers all over the world relating to diverse aspects of India including
tourism, wildlife, social and cultural issues, travelogues etc. Over 90
per cent of these proposals were cleared, while others are at various
stages of clearances awaiting requisite approvals of other central and
state government departments.
Supply of print material : The division continued to procure
and supply books, magazines, journals and other periodicals for use
in the libraries of and for distribution to local dignitaries, opinion
108

makers and academic institutions abroad. 77 titles of books were
purchased and distributed to all Indian missions and posts abroad.
Booklets on Prime Ministers speeches at 9th G-15 Summit, brochures
on India and UN (in English and French); Indias role in UN peacekeeping; biographies of Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers;
and India at a Glance (in Portuguese) were some of the projects taken
up for implementation. Quarterly compilation of press releases and
Spokesmans statements were printed regularly.
Infrastructure : Major renovation and restructuring work,
including the construction of a new state-of-the-art auditorium, an
audio-visual library and a waiting room for visitors is under
implementation.
MEA website : The ministrys website was kept updated on a
daily basis to cover all developments relating to foreign policy, nuclear
issues, international terrorism, speeches and interviews of dignitaries,
official spokesmans statements, bilateral treaties and agreements
signed by India, Indias political and economic developments, general
elections, Parliament questions and answers etc. During the Kargil
conflict, a special section was launched which included daily updates
by the Armed Forces, statements by the ministry and international
and Indian press coverage of the conflict. The website server was
also upgraded to incorporate audio-visual contents and a greater
volume of textual material. The website received an average of 2.2
million hits per month and was widely appraised and appreciated by
the users. The website was also hyper-linked by some of the important
organizations like CNN, The Economist, etc. for information relating
to India. An e-mail-based media reporting system for feedback from
abroad on the local reporting and for retrievable storage of this
reporting was started with selected missions abroad. Extensive archival
material on Indias foreign policy is being loaded on the website for
reference and easy retrieval.

Annual Report 1999-2000

India Perspectives, the monthly magazine of the ministry was
published every month in ten different languages for distribution
through Indian missions and posts abroad. Demand for the
publication has been ever-increasing and 55,000 copies were printed
during the year for supply to Indian missions and posts. Besides
highlighting Indias historical and cultural heritage, the journal has
been focussing on the impressive progress made by India in the fields

of science and technology and the steps taken to globalize the countrys
economy. Two special issues of the magazine were brought out in
March 1999 to mark the Prime Ministers historic visit to Lahore and
to commemorate the celebration of the tricentenary of the
establishment of the Khalsa Panth Special Millennium issues, which

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

T

he Passports for Indian nationals, visa for foreign nationals
and Consular services encompass the activity in which the
Ministry of External Affairs and its subsidiary organisation
Central Passport Organisation  (CPO) serve the public directly. In
this era of increased foreign travel and globalisation the issue of a
passport empowers the individual to become a global citizen. Through
its activities the Consular, Passport and Visa (CPV) Division facilitates
the export of Indian manpower, expertise and technology abroad.
The growing number of Non-Resident Indians and the People of
Indian Origin abroad constitute a vital and vibrant link between India
and the rest of the world. In the Nineties as the international scene
has witnessed momentous changes, the people of Indian Origin
abroad have matured politically, prospered economically and have
developed socially nurturing their roots and simultaneously integrating
fully with the societies of their countries of adoption. In the new
millennium communities of people of Indian Origin are well poised
to play a significant role in promoting Indias interests and in
contributing towards the strengthening of Indias political and
economic relations with their respective countries of residence.
Passport Services
The CPO was imbued with a new dynamism and concerted efforts

were made to fulfil the Governments commitments under the
Citizens Charter through various innovative measures aimed at
providing efficient, prompt and transparent service at the 28 Passport
Offices. Two new Passport Collection Centres were opened at
Vijaywada and Mangalore during the year. The Passport Rules were
amended to allow for printing, distribution and sale at a nominal
price of passport application forms for convenience of the passport
applicants.
A website was launched which carries all the rules, regulations
etc. for passport, visa and PIO Cards and allows all kinds of
applications forms to be downloaded.
Concerted efforts were made to reduce the pendency of
applications in various Passport Offices for which procedures were
streamlined. A Pendency Clearance Week was declared in the last
week of July and November and December were declared as Pendency
Clearance Months. Annual Passport Officers Conference was held
on 9-10 November 1999 at which emphasis was placed on reforming
and revamping the procedures to make the system more productive
and efficient. There was special emphasis on the redressal of public
grievances and the practice of periodical Passport Adalats was
initiated at eleven Passport Offices.

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

Several measures were initiated to simplify and streamline various
procedures for issuing passports and rendering other miscellaneous
services promptly and efficiently in keeping with the commitment
under the Citizen Charter. The Police verification system was
comprehensively revised to make it more responsive to public demand.
To meet the public demand a Tatkaal Scheme for out of turn
issue of passports was launched. The fee for this scheme was set at a
higher level to meet the extra costs involved in interruption of the
normal chain and sequence of work in the issue of an out of turn
passport.
At most Passport Offices concrete measures were taken to
enhance the level of comfort to the applicants/visitors by increasing
the number of public counters, augmenting air-conditioning,
installation of water coolers, provision of chairs etc.
The computerisation of Passport Offices continued and four
more Passport Offices were computerised taking the total of
computerised Passport Office to 19. Other Passport Offices are also
in the process of being computerised. A proposal for a comprehensive
satellite based computerised networking and connectivity as well as
creation of a Central Processing Cell has been formulated. The process
of tenders for comprehensive computerisation of all Passport Offices
has been initiated to take advantage of the latest available technology.
Separately machine writing of passports is being started on an
experimental basis in the Delhi Passport Office.
It has been the endeavour of the Government of India to house
the Passport Office in Government owned properties. At present
Passport Offices buildings at four places (Mumbai, Cochin, Kozhikode
and Hyderabad) are owned by MEA, at five places are owned by the
Central Government/State Government and are rented in 19 places.
The Passport Office at Hyderabad was shifted to a new building owned
116

by MEA during the year. MEA has acquired plots of land/built-up
properties in various cities in India and construction work is in
progress at five places viz. Ahmedabad for office and residential
complex, Cochin (residential complex), Patna (Office complex), Panaji
and Kozhikode (residential complex). The process for purchase of
land and construction of buildings for Passport Offices has been
initiated at seven other places i.e. Bangalore, Lucknow, Jaipur,
Thiruvanathapuram, Chandigarh, Tiruchirappalli, Jammu and
Calcutta. In Chennai space in an office complex has been purchased
and possession would be taken over in a few months.
The number of applications received during the year for grant of
passports and other miscellaneous services like renewal, change of
name, additional booklets, fresh passports for minors etc. continued
to rise in keeping with the overall climate of liberalization and increased
travel of Indians overseas. A total number of 25.78 lakh passports
were issued and 24.30 lakh miscellaneous services were rendered.
During the year 1999, detailed figures of passports issued/ services
rendered, including the revenue and expenditure of Passport Offices
are at Appendix-IV
A conscious beginning was made to introduce modern
management practices in the passport issue system. Services of a
private consultancy firm and a management expert were mobilized
for a management and process study of Regional Passport Officer,
Delhi.
PIO Cards
The six million Indian Citizens and over twenty million People
of Indian Origin (PIO) resident abroad have collectively evolved into
a major instrument for the furtherance of Indias foreign policy.
Recognising their significant role in the shaping of the countrys
destiny, Government launched the PIO Card Scheme for Persons of

Annual Report 1999-2000

Indian Origin, settled in countries specified by the Government, which
has, besides introducing a visa free regime, also conferred some special
economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits. All preparations,
were completed in time for the issue of PIO Cards from Missions
and Posts abroad.
Consular Services
All Missions and Posts abroad were sensitised to the consular
needs of Overseas Indians and to render them efficient and timely
assistance on all days and at all hours. Problems encountered by NonResident Indians/workers especially in the Gulf countries, including
disputes with their employers/sponsors were sought to be promptly
redressed. Government maintained contacts with the Governments
of the Gulf countries, including through the institutional mechanism
of the Joint Commissions, with the objective of resolving consular
problems and ameliorating the conditions of Indian workers in those
countries. In cases of deaths of Indians abroad, assistance continued
to be arranged by our Missions and Posts for completing the
formalities for early dispatch of the mortal remains, maintaining liaison
with the local and Indian authorities and keeping the relatives of the
deceased informed.
During the year, 8945 Indians were arrested abroad and 3589
deaths of Indian abroad were reported to the Ministry. A summary
of the consular data for the year 1999 is at Appendix-V
Visas
Indias 157 Missions and Posts abroad provided visa services to
over a million foreigners in the period 1 January to 30 September
1999. Over the years the procedure for grant of visa by our Missions
and Posts has been streamlined. Many Missions and Posts give visas
either across the counter or the same day and most others grant visas
within 48 hours.

The Consular Wing at CGI, Birmingham was computerised
during the year. It is proposed to computerise the Consular Wings of
our Missions and Posts in the Gulf, West Europe and North America.
A number of software companies have been short-listed and the
process of evaluation of their technical proposals and commercial
offers is at an advanced stage. First those Missions and Posts would
be computerised where the volume of services rendered is high.
Bilateral Agreements
As part of the global endeavour to combat organized crime,
international terrorism and drug trafficking, and acknowledging the
growing international dimensions of financial and other crimes,
consular agreements are being negotiated with several countries to
provide legal and institutional framework. These consular agreements
include Extradition Treaties, Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance
in Criminal Matters, Agreements on Mutual Legal Assistance in Civil
Matters and Consular Conventions.
During the visit of Kazakh Foreign Minister to India in October,
1999 an Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
was signed. In November 1999, an Extradition Treaty, an Agreement
on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and an Agreement
on Juridical and Judicial Cooperation in Civil and Commercial matters
were signed during the visit of the Minister of Justice and Aukaf of
the UAE. The Extradition Treaty signed with the USA in June 1997
was ratified and instruments of ratification were exchanged in July
1999. During the year, official and technical level consultations were
held with Tunisia, Oman, Poland and Mongolia and Extradition
Treaties were initialed with all these countries. An Agreement on
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and an Agreement on
Mutual Legal assistance in Civil Matters were also initialed with
Mongolia.

Passport and Consular Services and Indians Overseas

The Ministry is actively pursuing requests for extradition and
other legal assistance from foreign Governments both for criminal
and civil and commercial charges. The requests for extradition emanate
from our obligations under the Extradition Treaties or Extradition
Arrangements entered into with various countries. During the year
16 requests for extradition and 68 requests for legal assistance were
received in addition to the ongoing cases.
During the year, 2,47,731 documents were accorded consular
attestation in CPV Division of which 1,55,645 were commercial
documents. This service is rendered on the same day, is without any
charge and is prompt and efficient.
Renovation of Patiala House
The CPV Division located in Patiala House, visited by a large
number of persons who come for attestation of documents as well as
by diplomats and staff of foreign Missions in New Delhi. Over the
years the building had become dilapidated and shabby in appearance.
Comprehensive renovation of the exterior as well as interior of the
building was undertaken and completed during the year.
Central Passport Organisation
The personnel of the Central Passport Organisation (CPO) man

118

the 28 Passport Offices and 15 existing Passport Collection Centres.
The current strength of CPO Cadre is 1690 with 173 Officers and
1517 non-gazetted staff. One of the major demands of the employees
has been for a comprehensive Cadre Review as there is stagnation at
various levels. A proposal for Cadre Review-cum-Creation of Posts
was partially approved by the Ministry of Finance in June 1999. A
fresh proposal has been prepared for Cadre Review to enhance the
number of officials to deal with public grievances and to streamline
the supervisory system.
As the volume of work as well as the network of Passport Offices
and Passport Collection Centres has been growing over the years, the
Ministry is considering a proposal to create a Central Passport
Authority with a view to grant greater autonomy to Passport Offices
to achieve greater efficiency and higher productivity.
Vision
The Consular, Passport and Visa work constitutes an important
public service. The public rightly expects prompt and courteous
service with minimal delays. The mission of the Ministry is to meet
the public expectations and provide a level of satisfaction of which it
can be proud.

Indian Cultural Centres Abroad
One of the primary objectives of the Council is to promote greater
awareness of Indias composite cultural heritage abroad. Towards this
end the Council has set up and maintains 14 cultural centres in Cairo
(Egypt), Berlin (Germany), Port Louis (Mauritius), Paramaribo
(Surinam), Georgetown (Guyana), Jakarta (Indonesia), Moscow

(Uzbekistan), Durban and Johannesburg (South Africa), Port of Spain
(Trinidad and Tobago) and Colombo (Sri Lanka). All these cultural
centres are functioning under the administrative control of the Indian
Missions in the respective countries.
The activities of these Indian Cultural Centres can broadly be
classified under two categories. Several of the Centres have been set
up in countries having a sizeable Indian population, like the centres
in Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritius, Guyana, Surinam etc. The Centres
activities there reflect the need of the local Indian population to keep
in touch with Indian traditions through activities such as regular
training in Indian Music, Dance and Yoga.
The Centres also organise programmes to observe important
dates and events in the Indian calendar. Other Centres like those in
London, Berlin and Moscow focus more on intellectual activities such
as organising lectures, talks, panel discussions and seminars on subjects
of contemporary and cultural interest, publications of newsletters
etc. These are mainly aimed at increasing an understanding of India
through mutual interaction.
